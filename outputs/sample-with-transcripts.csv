UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,0D369WDrBCU,(#2) 12June24 Regular Town Council Meeting,,23.0,1355.0,2024-06-13T12:35:28Z,none,135,2,0,0,"for we the Town Council of Fort Fairfield do hereby recognize Miss Ella Leon on this J June 12th 2024 for her dedication professionalism and contributions to this community as an employee of the town of Fort Fairfield and be it further resolved that M Lon be wished a full and rewarding life in a retirement years and if it pleases the chair I'd ask Miss Leon to to step forward real briefly and provide her with the opportunity to say a few words if she'd like she' asked me to be able to say Thank you so you got the floor she she looked at me surprised and I'm like I swear she asked me if she say thanks but maybe she didn't it's been a long week come on now it's been 23 long years well I'm going the new chapter in my life I just want to say thank you to the citizens taxpayers management the counselors and my coworkers um all of you have been very important to me and you have all contributed to my success and my happiness and [Applause] thank so I mentioned in uh the proclamation that Ella has worn many hats for the town and I'd like for her to wear one more I may have got you a special gift you may no longer be the town tax collector or awesome our Treasurer but you are our CFO Chief fishing officer thank you thank you you some for the rest of us a motion here to accept the proclamation I motion to accept motion second all those in favor approval of the award of the tax anticipation note is Item B and their new business uh so uh I cast The Net far and wide this year looking for the best solutions to help us manage our expenses and cash flow uh even outside of the normal banking channels uh and ultimately the town received two bids which each can paint uh two proposals um chai Savings Bank which offered us a $975,000 tax anticipation note with uh with two different rates and TD Trust which offered a million dooll one uh with also with two different rates but two different options one being a fixed rate and one being an adjustable revolving tan um I I will tell the council I'm very intrigued by the idea of an adjustable tan because our cash flow swings can be extreme over the course of a day week and a month uh but looking at the capital improvement process and the County taxes that we will be pay uh in our leanest months this year it does not make sense to me to select an a option that at this point in time is three 3 and a qu% more than our current than the fixed rate um so it would be my recommendation to council that we award the tan to katad trust uh for the million dollars at the 5.35% fixed rate on the traditional tan um it's again a reduction not a significant ruction but in a rate when rates aren't going down any reduction is a welcome reduction in rate deal with you know they wanted our deposits uh um it's it's hard to move your deposit relationship when somebody's paying taxes on your Main Street yeah that's fair sorry that we accept to manager recommendation okay motion second okay hi hi excellent yeah it didn't help my statue in the CH so maybe heading down uh approval of the special six-month County tax payment uh as I mentioned to Council in some of our previous meetings that I had a conversation with the County Administrator um because this special six-month County tax payment and the increases that we've seen from the county uh make our combined Bild to the county somewhere in the air of $582,000 this year um certainly we had the option to pay this one time or over the course of three years this special six Monon tax uh but in discussing it with uh Mr pellet here uh ultimately it it seemed right that we again try to use this very unique budget cycle to pay this off and get it off our books um and so I negotiated with him a deal that would allow the town to pay that six Monon assessment in full when the town's coffers are full in February versus borrowing to pay it technically due September we might pay it as late as October 31st because there's no taxes till November 1st but still uh you guys get the point the idea being they're going to be flushed with cash it's our lean time why not wait uh the County Administrator and his U group agreed sorry I just blinked on what commissioner thank you Tony commissioner um and ultimately had asked us to just put it in writing that we would choose to to take this uh proposal and move it forward so that's what I've written up for folks uh to see that we would just pay the County's six Monon tax get it off our backs and move on uh into uh the next budget cycle um so that's what this agreement is it allows us the opportunity to pay this with zero interest owed in February rather than borrowing to paid in the fall I move that we approve man request motion second okay any discussion all those in favor I I item D would be approved the letter of Engagement with felin company but unfortunately as of today uh today's date I still have not received that letter of Engagement I have spoken with them they do intend to provide audit services to the town since we do not have the proposal I cannot approve uh Council cannot approve uh the letter of Engagement um but our year end is fast approaching um I felt it would be appropriate uh they have expressed their interest to continue to be the town's auditor that we approve them as the town's auditor so we can work with them at the end of the year and then uh if for some reason the letter of Engagement that we receive is not satisfactory or not forthcoming uh we could pivot in July uh but I just know not knowing all the legal nuances of how year end works I'm still learning uh I felt it might be appropriate to at least uh approve them as the Auditors I know their intention is to move forward should their expenses be ridiculously out of line with what we historically paid um we will cross that bridge in July um but I would I would we're going to struggle to find a different auditor if they're not our auditor and they been do them a long time and they do a good job that we approve 10 yep motion second any discussion all in favor I we also received our renewal from our insurance carrier um with mixed emotions um I I would move forward with the renewal of this insurance policy the rate increase is modest 2.35% um you know that accounts to about $2,000 uh the concern that I have is the reduction of or the removal of cyber coverage uh from our policy we will ultimately have to explore options to cover ourselves in the event we were a victimized in a Cyber attack of some sort um it's just the the world that we live in currently uh governments are targets and it's one of the things that we've been working to sh up our own internal defenses um let things happen um and unfortunately your biggest risk within business or government is training people um it only takes one click on a link for us to be uh have all of our accounts logged up or download a program or what have you um so I would move that or I would see council's approval to to renew this insurance policy and I will come back to council once we've had an opportunity to receive uh quotes on Cyber coverage it through this insure others I've requested it through this one but that's where again hidden increase you know just part of GL policy general liability yeah this is our general liability it's our Auto it's commercial marine it's our firefighter EMT and police it it's a big policy and it's a significant reduction in cost from where we were two years ago uh we shopped around we found a different provider uh so far so good with our interaction with that provider um but you know the increase doesn't look like a lot Until you realize what you lost right it's it's like buying a box of cereal that used to be 10 ounces and now it's eight and the cost has gone up you've still lost two ounces of cereal in your pain apparently have yeah um so anyway I have that policy if anybody wants to review it but uh I do want to uh move forward without Ure so we St yep a motion okay motion second any discussion all in favor I I so ultimately uh last month I brought before the council uh the concerns uh that had been voiced by Pat Troy um about the sustainability and a viability of the town's Harbor committee uh currently there are only two active members um in their question was could we help them uh the council appoints uh and nominates uh the the members of this committee uh the town spread the word we received no nominations I received no nominations and as of this point I I haven't received any from Council uh so I did meet with Miss try again uh I believe it was yesterday um and she as Pat had alluded to earlier had met with some other folks in town and really the arbor committee is no longer planting trees in town they've really transitioned into being a a beautification committee handling the barrels doing some mulching and flower beds uh like around the town office sign um and so her request from the the meeting that she had had with a group of citizens that would like to help is they just don't want the formality of a of a meeting they just like to basically make the town pretty uh they have their own checkbook their own checking account and their own funds um those funds have been earmarked I believe historically by the town um I I would put it in your folks hands do we continue to run a committee that doesn't have any members or do we disbanded and allow them to kind of work within the confines of uh I don't speak for Quality Poli Council I'm just remember their thought was maybe they could have quality plac in the folks that help with the barrels and other items in town uh work with them to do the the flower barrels um I have no arrangement to make that happen I just want to bring forth to council that these folks are saying there's nobody to help us and we don't want to do this anymore as as a formal Harbor community um they're looking to disband and then potentially reorganize in a in under different nonprofit I recommend you table until that happens if they do disband you eliminate the the labeling of committee and you start using there won't be appointments anymore you a volunteer group like the beautification committee was once upon a time they came to us and asked so much per capita because they didn't have any funds y but they do now but I I would make I would make a suggestion that you table that for now until it is formally disbanded in favor we'll reach out to M try uh item G is an appointment to the for fold Housing Authority board uh Stacy misho the Housing Authority director has asked the council to approve the nomination and appointment of Sher Whitley a resident of the as a resident commissioner I'm sorry um she would be filling David donov turn that ends on June 30th 2026 I that we approve that nomination okay motion second any discussion all those in favor I and the last item I have tonight is the um donation of an aluminum truck body uh I received a request uh earlier this week from the fire chief uh members of the for fa Volunteer Fire Association um had done some fundraising and ultimately uh would like to donate an aluminum Flatbed Truck Body for a truck that the fire department is uh going to receive from the highway department um ultimately this is a repurposing of a truck that we already have that's Surplus to Highway uh there has been a little bit of a a Rec truck went to highway highway had an extra truck that would go to the fire department and help them out I it's um kind of an internal thing in terms of you know cost um this work would be done here but they would like to donate this to make it a more functional vehicle for the fire department is that yes any questions or concerns had entertain a motion to approve we approve that okay motion second any discussion all those in favor you have heard enough for me chairman sir turn it back over to you and take you drink of water thank you Tim i' entertain a motion here to accept the approve the minutes from the May 15th uh council meeting and also to approve the May 15th second public hearing on the fiscal year 2425 Municipal budget motion second second any discussion all those in favor I entertain a couple more motions uh warrant number 21 in the amount of $392,900 um I was approached by a citizen today uh talking about uh probably hopefully being able to sign uh the uh ATV Crossing area where there was a accident last week and I talked to Matt about it he I think considering uh applying through the state for uh them to sign it I guess it's the state road so they have to sign it yeah we have to to discuss with the state if that's something that they do which I don't know if they typically do for those uh Crossings Darren might know a little bit better usually it's up to the at Club to sign anything but it still has to be approved by state has to be approved by the do y so I think that maybe the governing body could come up with some sort of request and we can p it on to D we approve request for whatever Chief com andar need for our approvable okay who applies I think it's just a phone call to have a conversation with the the director and we can believe there's a motion motion a second second any further discussion okay all those in favor anything else the only other item that I would bring before Council and I apologize because this was not on my radar until this afternoon uh apparently the governor has moved to close All State offices on July 5th because the 4th of July falls on a Thursday that is not a holiday that we would take off as Town employees but there are many departments that work four day weeks or what not that would have that Friday uh historically off I haven't wrapped my brain around it enough to have a a reasonable discussion within my head the thought process that I had come up with and what I had seen other managers in other towns are doing is they're giving Town employees the option to use personal time off and be closed on that Friday I I'm have mixed opinions on that but I had written down myself a note um we're closed the 28th because we close our fiscal year I could see I mean it's selfish of me I'll be honest I'm I'm off the fifth you know I'm supposed to be off all next all that week but um I I can see it both ways if Town employees wanted to take that day off and have the town office closed makes sense to me but it wouldn't incur a cost of the Town um they would be using their own personal time um I don't think it's a very heavy traffic day in the town office I mean most people are going to turn that into a 4- day weekend um the state office closures what does that do to the town operations we could still function should we need to be open that day um doing applications uh registrations what have you uh but we would have no ability to contact this state if somebody has a registration issue or question or Moses issue which those are those are common where somebody registers online and then there's an issue um again I I hadn't put it in a formal thought process because it kind of crossed my desk at about two this afternoon and like I got to be more foresightful I guess U but that's the challenges having a meeting a week earlier than I'm ready for um I certainly put it out there for counselors to discuss if you wanted to um I I certainly could go either way but I will you know be honest I a lot of staff are off it would really basically just impact if the town office was open that day um the employees I did speak to about the issue all said that they would take personal time gladly and cl I'm going to leave it I'm going to leave it in your hands that's that's my opion God love you I appreciate that I think that's that's that's the job we hired you to do man I I would lean towards it because I I just don't think it's a very busy busy day uh but I also don't want the town to ur that cost it isn't you know it isn't a holiday I mean I'm already The Grinch who stole Christmas Eve I don't want to be the guy that gives it back it's the day after the Fourth of July like I just that doesn't work for me but I do think if if staff want to take that time off you know suers up here are short we work really hard um if we can provide a benefit that way that doesn't have a cost of taxpayers I I I personally would lean towards closing the town office I apologize that I didn't have a formal presentation me do we need like a motion do we need to vote on that to administrative decision as far as I'm concerned okay so it's my fault when people show up angry on theth I I can accept that right then we will move to close office on theth last public comment period of the evening anybody I'm and I want to thank Town Council Department the work that be done over the last months on the budget I think it did a lot of insight thanks Ste anybody else okay one more motion second all in favor please don't run away we need a lot of your autographs she's got copies",True

tonight we're going to get our meeting started uh all councils are present and like to ask Tony to leave us confirm we pray for our country at all times that all citizens are safe healthy and happy we pray for wisdom for all those who guide and govern help this govern body in every situation to know and to do the things that are right and just the SS of judgment and making vital decisions we pray for the peacemakers that the Holy lifegiving Spirit May ever dwell in their hearts and the barriers of fear suspicion and hatred may fall this we pray the Holy Father amen am the United States of America to theic stand Nation indivisible liy and justice for all public open the podium that your name FL fantastic thank you councelor too so we'll start off under correspondence and reports with licenses and permits uh we did hold a public hearing at noon today uh for renewal of uh prior license holders licenses that have already been approved by the council uh ultimately i' I've attached the list for Council to to review and ultimately under new business I'll seek to have Council vote to approve those license renewals um we did have no attendees no one uh voicing an opinion either for or against any of those current LIC holders uh we did receive one other uh application for a catering permit uh very last minute um last uh two weeks ago I guess on Friday um from an already licensed permittee um the folks that run the maple Pig Josh Tweety who also owns a grocery store here in town uh so uh as a manager I'm authorized to be able to sign off on a permit like that and uh if I believe that the council ultimately would choose to do so it was a private event um that was uh well attended and ultimately it met all the criteria that I felt that were necessary for um that permit so um ultimately I'll ask Council to approve those license renewals uh under new business any questions or concerns on I so move that we approve we're going to do that new business we're going to do that new business oh we are yeah yeah just because of the sheer volume of them all right thanks J uh in terms of the fin final report because we have so many items on our list today I just kind of want to hit some of the the high points on the month of May uh really kind of came out of the month of May uh looking fairly strong uh really have stepped it up in terms of our ability to uh generate some return on the funds that we keep on hand um always would love to make more uh the banker and me uh is pretty greedy that way um but you know when we project 300 and we make 10,000 that's not bad uh revenues continue to be pretty close to Target uh at the end of May we stood at 98.38% of budget with about $120,000 still collect uh Revenue sharing and excise tax should post this over that um over 100% on our uh collections or Revenue uh month of May was a significant Rebound in excise tax I had started to have my doubts um but ultimately we collected uh more than 11% of our yearly total last month um and we remain about 20,000 shy the full projection of property taxes uh we do anticipate uh getting some past taxes and current taxes due uh paid on Friday uh due to the sale of the property so that should help make those numbers look even better um on the expense side uh we are at uh supposed to be at about 92% of budgeted expenses by the end of May um but ultimately we're only at about 82% um we will have some significant year in expenses things that only happen at the end of the quarter and what have you but uh I would expect that we would be below budget overall when the books close at the end of August because we still have expenses from June that we pay out in July uh I would expect us to be about 3 to 4% of overall budget with about so that would translate to about $100,000 that would be in excess um of what we had um projected as expenses um all we is an opportunity for something to come up and B us uh but at least we'll be able to to enter into the new year with a reasonably decent cash flow uh and I have been outlining cash flow here the last couple weeks because or the last couple uh Financial reports because I think cash flow is an important piece of the puzzle it really dictates what we're able to do when we're able to do it um so right now with about you know 800,000 in the bank in the last month going into the beginning of the new year uh not a bad position to be in certainly an improvement years past um but not where we also have been historically where we've paid well in excess of million dollars uh in terms of costs that continue to be a pest uh the two major ones where we're really far over budget are utilities uh we're already 104% and budgeted for the year with another month or two to go in expenses um and in uh insurances um I did get our insurance renewals we'll talk about that a little later on the meeting um where comp will come down in its overall cost but it will look like an increase in the budget um and then our um Regular General policy is a slight increase but as I was explaining to a couple folks earlier that slight increase is offset by the fact that we also lose our cyber coverage in this policy so we may incur an additional cost there if we want to protect ourselves so um all in all uh things look pretty good I'll talk about the tan a little bit later on but uh the tan is a perfect example of a improved financial position that the town is in um interest rates haven't moved the FED didn't move the rate again uh this week and uh we still saw a 63 basis point reduction in the interest rate on our tan for next year which is um on a million dollars uh half a percent is a lot of money uh so that's uh significant for us to see so um we're heading in the right direction uh any questions folk on May's expens or any of those items that I just fantastic uh I will move on to the arusc way Solutions report and invite Mr reesy to come forth with his report CTIC was solution last on May 24th uh we were we over our April finances and we were our income was about 10% above what was projected to be which is a good thing and our EXP were 14% below which were expectation to have um some of you may be aware of this um our recycling truck has been having some problems uh get some support to it I'm not actually sure it's see back up yet winch they had try to make a winch work on that and that's the vehicle that we used to pick up an EMP the so overy long time they've got a solution for it system the PO the truck and BR it back up here that did bring us into an open discussion on maybe we looking at how we're picking up the recyclables in the future most of those around 28 years old the cost ofing and replacing them um is really kind of cross there's only one manufactur bills now so we're just looking at different options to use instead of the Ines and we're hoping to U maybe put something forth for next year's budget and this year we have to fix for us to use between now and then hopefully that's all situated pretty quickly for us um just a quick update on our two new CS 5 and six we got a very small punch list it's really just waiting for some parts to come in which is not a b problem we have we had a DP inspection at our meeting schedule that's taking place and pass color so we're in pretty shape on our two cells going forward probably 10 years C that's good news for us um the other discussion that we were having I think a lot of a lot of municipalities in CL municipalities haven't seen one we're having a little trouble with Staffing due to our what we're paying for there been such an increase in pay for other jobs around the county that we really need to read address what we're doing for our base sces and uh we kind of locked in our budget for this year so we're trying to be a little more Innovative how we going to do that and we may bring a plan back back to us to adjust that for in our next Mee any questions for aage w there I think around 17 18 now yeah so that's like scale Chang depending on what mechanics rates we just recently went through in details year and a half ago things going uh one thing I can tell you is that we we pride ourselves on our our benefits are better than most benefits so one of the isues that you have when you bring young people in looking at jobs they don't look at the longterm benefits once they look at the dollar right in front of them and our long time employees understand the benefits of for us but we're going to look at some different options and certainly your call thank you very much thanks and piggy back off one of the items that Mr reesy just mentioned that um recycling boom that that is broken currently also is delaying our ability to roll out the um battery recycling program that we're the pilot of so just that's how critical this piece of equipment is so that's why that's also on hold as well uh moving along June election results uh yesterday we held the uh Republican and Democratic primaries uh had a pretty good uh flow of folks through uh in this day and age where folks are concerned about election results and what not I feel it's important that we put those results out there and publish them uh in our council meeting so folks are aware of what was voted on while it has impacts locally there were no local candidates so I'm not going to announce any results because these are all Statewide races that will ultimately voted on again in the fall but I wanted you folks to be able to see those results and uh ask any questions if you had any hearing none I will move on to the Elks award uh and as you guys know Chief tummings has done a lot of good for our community since being hired as our chief of police in August of 2021 um helping reestablish our department very proactive approach and ultimately uh if it pleases the chair I would like to uh ask Mr hard to come forward as they would the Elks would like to recognize Chief Cummings for his

planning anything on that because I think we want to do one really nice event like we did last year so we really kind of want to put our efforts in our planning um and our money into putting on a nice event maybe up to park again towards the end of the season oh yeah nice excellent thank you Council moving on to item G uh I I apologize but I'm never afraid to say that I'm ignorant but I am ignorant of the process of how a town adopts a town seal where a town seal comes from and what have you and the reason that I say that is because uh last month the local artist Amy Schwarz reached out to the town with an offer for the town of Fort Fairfield to use her artwork um as a new more modern Town seal uh she has donated the use of this design and I do have it on the back of the of the packet for you um two organizations within town to use for fundraising and is offering the town the same opportunity to do so um the town seal at is at the top of this memo uh it's kind of hard to duplicate sometimes on a on different logos and clothing or what have you um but ultimately uh what I wanted to do is just bring forward one this generous offer uh I'm not suggesting that we change the town SE I wouldn't even know the process to do so uh but I did want to bring forth one this offer two to thank uh Amy Schwarz for her generosity and support of the community and to let Council know that we plan to incorporate the use of this design somehow um the question would be and this is where I love to ask questions to you folks is it worth just using as like a secondary logo like you would is as a sports team or is it worth uh us as staff looking into the process of how a town logo gets changed and adopted clearly there's a process to it because uh we've seen how the states worked on the state flag and other items I I don't think you can just flip a switch and have a new logo um but certainly we can use this on uh as as needed and as we see bit um but that would be the one piece of the question uh her thought was here's a new town logo I'm not sure we can just up in new logo I will look to see if anybody has any guidance for me but I or we can look into it I Mr parliamentarian me tell me I believe that when Neil Susi introduced his seal to the town it was very similar to where he'd come from before and it was a vote of the council to use it they are our legislative body so if you want to use it as a tool without eliminating the town seal then I think you have the ability as the administrator to just say we're going to use this on our letter head instead of the Town seal or but there's an awful lot of expense out there to put the town seale on our vehicles and to change that would be an arm and a leg right now in my opinion but I don't see you giving the instructions let's use this from this point forward and then at some point if they want to adopt it it will be that simple okay in my mind if you start to see the Logo Pop Up in places it isn't a new town seal but it's a alternative version of the Town seal is what I would say uh unless you folks see any reason that we shouldn't utilize it it's very easy to replicate it's it's a nice clean look and it's it's very attractive again I'd like to thank Amy Schwarz publicly for her generosity and donating this design to the town any thoughts or questions from the council hearing none I will move on to the next item up for bids which is uh the town office closure uh I'm not sure if this requires a vote I I've seen it both ways uh but the town office uh requires uh the ability to close on the last day of the fiscal year uh which this year falls on Friday June 28th uh so we can close our financial records it's uh it's very difficult to do during the course of the day if you have incoming transactions because you just can't can't get a clear number uh so historically at least for the last five or six years uh the town office has closed on the last day of the fiscal year so that we can do our year end reporting um if there's any objection to us doing that please let us know but if not um our plan will be to be in the office working on the 28th closing up the new year and getting ready for business will reopen sharp uh 7:30 sharp on Monday July 1st excellent the next item item I uh I joked earlier we have more yes today than a Bob Hope special uh I would ask Cheryl Boer who's been working on the main potato Blossom Festival to please address ccel and give us an update on what's coming with Festival next month thank you Sher I got my CRI out time to dance I'm going to be great it's it's a standing joke good evening everyone uh I'm happy to report that things are going well with the planning stages of the Festival this year we have 60 events planned some of them are the returning favorites and others are new ones most of these events are headed up by one or more volunteers which adds up to a lot of people who are dedicated and helping for this Festival I've tried to incorporate more delegation this year into the implantation forcement of the festival and was able to establish mes on the ground committee that will help with the setup involved with several events and also transportation of other things needed as well these eight dedicated volunteers are ones who will show up and help wherever needed and this is truly appreciated as the workload is heavy at times all the town departments are also very involved with the festival and lending a hand in many ways it's truly a team effort including our town manager Tim G and I can't enough that these all these departments have gone out of their way to help support me in the festival and each one of them were responsible for a lot of events as well and being able to you know have our Festival be safe and everything done so I thank them for their support as well as the town office crew I think have been just sweethearts in taking in applications and registrations and so I appreciate it all budget is still real con consideration and challenging at times has cost has risen across the board for the Festival this year recuiting funds is vital and very time consuming I will say we have many generous volunte uh sponsors that have supported us over the years but as you all are very aware of cost is rising with everything and that includes the festivals uh to give you a more realistic glimpse of the festival budget last year we ended with $3,000 in income and $48,000 in expenses so it's costly and that has gone up this year um my suggestion would be to transition the festival into a nonprofit status where any surplus can remain a seed money for next year's Festival this will also open up more opportunities for grant funding Grant planning is difficult with Miss fality level this year I've been over the year six years I've been here been able to just get funding from the oppos tourism which will do grant funding municipalities other than that the grants that I've got to add in the classroom the Community Foundation and the morz have all come from the generosity of quality of place and Tim allowing them to be fiscal sponsored for those grants so um I owe a lot to them for allowing us to do that and that's has provided more funding for the festival um seed money or as we refer to it as reserve for next year's Festival is vital for its success um I have made several Cuts this year in order to try to stay on budget remain in the black with Tim support I was able to stay another year as your director and have worked hard to make some changes I hope will help secure the future of the festival this Festival is of Great Value to this community whether that is fully realized or not on all levels it brings thousands of people to this area which Prov many opportunities for those doing fundraising and extra boo in business for many as well as time to Showcase not only the county with the community of Fort Fairfield it's a time that laughter abounds and the community shines I also want to share with you that the festival has been chosen this year to be a part of the episode on the show main life I was contacted by the film crew that will be here Festival week to film an episode dedicated to the festival and Fort Fairfield they will be interviewing several people filming events in the countryside we were chosen by the main office of Tourism to help promote the county and all it offers and they felt a festival top the list of events that stand out in showcasing a more rural way of life and its benefits it's an exciting opportunity for us I have spent as Tim knows and he has trying to convince people that we have a lot to offer in the county so now they're coming and they're going to see and it will be on Main l so I'm excited about that so that's it I thank you for your time you got any questions for me i' be glad to answer them well I'll get your your contact information there after the meeting there too try yeah yeah yes thank you so much keep is going to get me the reviewing stand with his name on it how appropriate thank you thank you in related news I'm resending my offer to wrestle in the mash potatoes because there will be a film crew here apparently fesal this year I just completely unrelated thank you Cheryl uh uh item J uh property violations up this has been an issue for many years in for Fairfield um we hear from residents we saw it in our Serv they were uh folks are frustrated with properties that are either have a collection of junk or the properties themselves are in uh poor repair um and so uh in May uh Darren Hansen uh Tony levik and myself uh did a spend a day basically driving through the community uh documenting those uh violations be illegal junkyard uh be it uh trash unsafe buildings uh der properties uh we tabulated the those results we sent out 59 uh violation letters uh towards the end of the month um and as of today I believe we're up to 34 different property owners that have contacted with the town either to inquire about why they received the letter or to talk about a plan to remediate the issue um which is good it would be great to see everybody voluntarily um comply with our our you know laws because illegal junkyards three three or more unlicensed vehicles unsafe buildings uh and the like it's difficult for the municipality to address those um but I wanted to let folks know that we are working towards a way to at least make folks aware that their properties are in violation to try to work with the property owners to try to get voluntary compliance and ultimately we will be going back out towards the end of July to see uh what sort of steps have been done to remediate those issues uh from there issuing a little bit more turly worded letter um and then at that point probably as we start to to inch towards fall um our goal is to uh compile a report and bring that back to Council of those properties that we feel really are the worst violators um what would we do from there look at a list um no hopefully but the challenge and and I think this needs to be brought out there publicly the challenge is if the town wants to move forward with enforcing these violations and imposing fines on non-compliant properties we will need legal representation to take them to court it's costly it's time consuming and it doesn't mean them are ever going to get made whole um I shared with a few of you an antidote about the town of Turner that had a property that was in violation since the the '90s 80,000 plus dollars in fines owed to the town uh was settled in court earlier this year the town $7,000 it took more than 20 years to get that one property compliant it's a frustration we we hear it I hear it from residents almost weekly um the same freedoms you enjoy of on your property are the same ones that keep people being able to do the same things that they do but I just want to make folks aware we are paying attention we are listening and hopefully U moving towards more compliance something that might be less costly might be some sort of for system place and I don't know what that would be but I mean thinking of it from a different angle I guess you reward the home owner somehow they just clean it up get it cleaned up that's that would might cost something but probably not as much as it going to cour yeah it may be way for us uh Council peler for us to utilize maybe some of our demo debris space at the at the landfill or unable to take the building down as a town maybe we can utilize that space and transfer it to them as a an incentive to tear down a der building or an unsafe property um you scrap metal prices are high so if anybody out there is sitting on a bunch of those illegal vehicles that are unregistered um you know um just putting it out there but I I I agree I I just think we've got to be creative um I think it's it's not a port Fairfield issue but we've got to deal with it as our community um but I do want to make folks aware you know we hear you we're frustrated s they bring down property values they pose safety threats um the good news is we we are getting some traction with some remediation and I think sometimes much like the the name in the book when you miss your tax payment sometimes getting that letter is is a piece of it you know maybe it's in the town report these are the property violations you know I mean it's a public Stockade in essence but it may be a way for folks to at least realize that we're paying attention and we when we like to see again vol BL is the goal um but if we have to um you know a few of these may need to be addressed a little bit more forcefully some some folks have a hard time doing the right thing um but I did want to bring that to council's attention it's it's it's on our radar we doing what we can but what we can do is Li any any questions or other thoughts I I think it's a great idea um I just maybe we some we can flush out how do we reward those folks or help them it's a good question uh the other item I wanted to bring up is it was uh related to Trio and the outage that the town experienced uh for the better part of three days about two weeks ago uh so backstory we switched Trio is the program that we use for our County uh tax payments basically everything flows through Trio uh budgetary uh expenses it's it's a it's the backbone of what we do in the town office um we switched to a new web based progam progr of Trio because the historic program that we have used as obsolete the background background program is no longer being supported by Microsoft um we've always had some glitches with that program so it's never been perfect but it it is the majority of what Town's using in name this Trio software uh we switched on May 14th uh to this new webbased program uh a contract that we had signed uh probably eight or 10 months prior to uh to finally make this transition um and we heard that there had been some issues with it uh and ultimately uh on the day of May 31st so the end of business on the end of the week at the end of the month uh we experienced an issue uh basically a a transaction that we had voided out disappeared but the void remained just a weird thing uh basically for 3 days that kept us unable to process transactions um we were lumped into a a Quee with all these other issues in Tri that were related to Motor Vehicles this was a motor vehicle transaction and by Tuesday at about 11:30 uh they finally realized that our issue was unrelated to a to an issue that they had with an update it still took another day for them to get it fixed and then it took us several hours to get the program updated uh very frustrating um we reached out to anybody and every everybody that we could uh senior Executives within the company I sent emails to people I don't know uh multiple times just to try to get some attention um but it was frustrating for residents it was frustrating for staff uh and I just want to let folks know that that's what occurred that's why we weren't able to process some transactions and hopefully with more knowledge and and a more stable program we won't see that same sort of program it's kind of the perfect storm is kind of what we'd likely to to as stat but um I just feel like Council should know we hold ourselves accountable we we did everything we could to try to get this right but the the question was going to be if we moved forward would all of the registrations that we' had done in the month of May or since our last close up to motor vehicle disappear and then people get pulled over and the license are or the registrations aren't recorded So anyway it was uh it was very frustrating um we'll continue to do our due diligence with Trio um so the trio that we have in place right now that's the battery backup is that battery back Up's power well the computers are yeah and we host it locally um but um we're working with our it folks to maybe have them run those updates um because the way it's hosted um there is a way to have them hosted we chose not to because there's a cost savings um but in the long run it it really was just their program and the state were not talking and for whatever reason we got caught up in this bigger glitch and then when they finally fixed that they realized oh that's not your problem and then we finally got looked at uh not optimal um I can tell you I I I was polite but I had a lot of words for a lot of people um and ultimately our issue was fixed and another issue that had been sitting out there since the day we went live with the program um so far so good this month um but I do want to let folks know you we don't want to not register folks vehicles but we're also not responsible if their vehicles have been unregistered for many many months and then driving them on the road um I can write you a note but I don't know if Chief will accept it um happy to answer any other the questions on that but I again I really wanted you folks to understand that uh what had occurred and and how powerless we felt in the process um I think we would be better I think we could do more work in this town office if we lost power than if we lose the internet that's kind of where the world is these days uh hearing no other questions did want to give a little bit of a a positive update on another negative the pool pumps uh we were able to get the pool pumps refurbished fixed and in place uh the pool is almost fully full I see about this far all fully full uh so hopefully if our pool guy gets here in the next few days we'll be able to open I don't want to say this weekend but certainly by Monday Doug give me a thumbs up on that so um the cost was significantly less than the $10,000 that count approved um we we're at about 13 almost $1,400 for the referment um still expensive but a significant savings and ultimately uh we should be able to move forward with a good season um next year we're going to open the pool in May the weather stays like it has been so far this spring Doug doesn't agree with that any questions on that I just wanted to make sure we updated folks on that as well um another update uh was related to our meeting in April when the friends of mson Pawn made a presentation to the council about the work that they're doing to investigate and address the water quality issues on Ms and pond uh we were um given advanced notice of award from the EPA for a watershed Grant uh that would be administered by the town but all the heid lifting will be done by the friends of mip pa um and so ultimately that uh award we learned on Monday that we had been awarded one of three uh bodies of a in the state main that were awarded under this program so now they'll work to look at those causes root causes and start to help us come up with a with plans to implement fixes to reduce whatever it is that's causing some of those issues with Ms of on does that sound about right in a nutshell CL fantastic um so anyway wanted to let you folks know that we're we were rewarded that and hopefully we'll get some answers here soon any questions on that EPA gr hearing none I would like to move forward to Old business if pleases the chair I have a motion yes sir I move that the fiscal year 2425 budget proposal be amended to reinstate the 1 mil property tax reduction we councils have discussed different options for the two 2000 the 205,000 and Tim has asked us for clarification I'm not aware that a decision was made to remove the mill rate reduction from the new budget taking this one mil property tax reduction that was built into the original budget away from the taxpayers without any attempt to trim even $1 from the spending in this budget is in my opinion unfair and unethical that's 1.2 million from the Rev 2 distribution of the state revenue sharing formula was enacted by the state legislature in 2000 specifically for property tax relief for towns with excessive mill rate we Council counselors should not be considering not returning at least one mill of all that money back to our taxpayers my motion is that the fysical year 2425 budget proposal be amended to reinstate the 1 mil property tax rate reduction got a motion a motion he's got he made motion motion yeah I got to have a motion you need a second I need a second I'll second okay any discussion I think it would be fair taxpayers to give back I don't think it's unfair that's what the money was was intended for the first placeas I know we had talked about that earlier but then we also had a workshop and we talked about um holding that money so that we in in case something came up that was unexpected or there was a direction that could go to maybe increase we never voted on it no we didn't vote on it we left it and we didn't vote on anything we never gave him any directions on it that's correct um I've heard from a lot of towns people people are happy with it they're not expecting a mill rate reduction I'm sure everybody would be happy if they did it's not something that people are saying they need to have this year I just think we're so new off a bad situation but I really think like stay the situation and leave it as is except the budget we are I think we are in a bad situation but you know we're not on the yet first exactly so caution is not a bad thing to do I think I think that we are being cautious if we help taxpayers I'm always going to be for the taxpayers and helping them however I also would like to not find ourselves in a bad situation again I like the idea of course with this as far as yo effect with the revenue sharing what what's that how would that for next year you know truly I am not the world's expert on Revenue sharing um but ultimately any reduction that you see in your mill rate is going to go into that formula where you work on you know the formulas your mill rate State valuation and then the tax bur on residents based on that and then it gets plugged into the system and then the state's you know tax revenues basically determine what your Revenue sharing would be so any mill rate move and any change in our valuation is ultimately going to cause a fluctuation in your um Revenue sharing uh ultimately this year we look to have a change in our mill rate regardless of what our budget is because we're going to be indexing uh we have to index or we won't receive state reimbursements at 100% so all Parcels properties houses Farmland buildings you name it will be indexed at a 10% increase in value because the sales data supports that property values are more than what we have the necess that that in itself will reduce what the mill rate is because we won't have to increase what we bring in for Revenue right um ultimately throughout this budget process um and again I I I understand folks get really focused on the mill rate uh because that's really where the conversation has been uh ultimately the budget that we had proposed uh from that last Workshop wouldn't have reduced or increased the cost to taxpayers that would have held the line for the year but you still would see a mill rate reduction because of that index sorry it sounds like a lot of words but it I hope that makes sense that's the explanation that I understood that's what made sense to me to get into the you know the semantics of let's lower the mill rate one mil um if you figure all of the other things that go into the factor of of of what proper tax are the mill rate I mean we could do what car did and lower our mill rate down way low um property taxes still went up there so I don't think that lowering our mill rate to a lower level and still having to produce an increased tax bill for taxpayers is going to help them at all I think all we're doing is putting out numbers and making making it sound like we're doing good deal for you we're going to reduce your bill rate not if the valuations and the indexing everything comes back and tax bills go up oneill going to make that much of a difference I mean it's $25,000 the way the way I look at it as a you know as a person hired to try to help the town um you know does it make that much a difference in a taxpayer's pocket and does it make that much difference in the municipal budget I have some different thoughts on that um when I do the math $25,000 divided by about 2,000 to 2200 taxpayers I think the number had come up with was $96 would be the average right if you kind of said everybody's properties worth the same clearly some folks would see more back and some would see less um but the thought process that I had after we had met as a council in that Workshop was if we had that $96 and we were able to leverage grant funding let's say at an 8020 match that $96 is worth $465 to the town that's where your Economic Development components come from you know currently what is our Economic Development quiver full of we don't have arrows in there to shoot if we want to purchase a property it's borrowing if we want to get Grant match it's borrowing or we skip the grant you know we have next to no reserves we'll we'll put about 100 Grand in reserves this year which is is great but that's all we'll have it's a big deal not having having all exist correct my my concern is a year from now two years from now three years from now going out every year every year I'm a conservative I know say that now I'm a conservative you know I've always been a penny ma my my concern is for the the town down the road I you know I you I thought know my concerns and uh I do believe you got a good plan I it's not simple it's simple I I think that's why when I had the opportunity to speak to council we talked about how this is a unique opportunity a unique U situation so I just want to point out to you that tonight it's your duty to adopt a budget either with changes or without changes you're not working on the mill rate or mechanics of the mill rate tonight when the total valuations are done you divide the valuations into the expenditures that are approved the budget expenditures that are approved total Consolidated expenses when that's done that's what gives you your me mill rate and we're not going to know that till September we're not so I can't see how triggering an automatic mill rate reduction helps this community run that's just what I'm saying as the assessor that's fact right not not change anything out drastically taking 96 and making 400 what you say $460 something dollars out of that I mean that's I mean that's what you get if you grant match it and I mean it's just an 8020 I mean maybe it's 75 25 okay it's a little bit less but right now what do we have in our in our Arsenal to attract Economic Development and I understand look I it we had a list of things that residents wanted and I know I've outlined those to folks this budget hits almost every single one of those high points between fixing roges we we don't put some money towards Economic Development they're going to continue with the same tax Bas it's a it's a real challenge okay the motion okay so uh go to vote on Jim's motion Kevin I support I'm got to support you said I would I'm TR oh you're so okay you v no I'm voting against okay no and I'm going to vote no on that so we'd like to I entertain a motion to approve fiscal year 2425 budget second yeah motion second any discussion I can't support that I can't support the increase in Municipal budget spending by 11% I believe that some of the depart Department cost increases in this budget toal are too high these include increases in the cost of operation by 12% and the cost of employees by 22% to some departments you can't just rubber stamp everything that every Department ask for we counselors have not trimmed even one dime from this budget I believe we will be short next year by over $350,000 plus more for inflation when we do not get the additional onetime extra 1 million from the state we councilors are the ones responsible for looking at the big picture planning ahead and controlling excessive budget grow we're not here for ceremonial reasons controlling vending growth is a tough job some of us have proposed setting a $130,000 Target and proposed cut in recurr Department spending that was based on the rate of inflation that proposal has been rejected it would have been the drop in the 4 million Municipal budget it would have shown a concern about longterm financial planning which the Auditors said the councils were not doing this led us to near bankruptcy as older council's terms expired the newer members will be left to deal with the disastrous now consequences of exploding property tax bills next year this is due to not acting now when they were able to I cannot support this budget this increases the municipal budget spending by 11% my concern is that we've had eight meetings including workshops and tours of facilities and we've met with department heads we've met with the councel we've met with the town manager and we've had workshops and we've discussed in detail issues and and questions we've had opportunities to raise questions and ask questions and can I can I stop there yes please we just get a vote now right no you're still under discussion you haven't called for the you haven't called for a vote so discussion will still be allowed until you call for a vote so I'm just responding okay okay I I just think that we've had an opportunity eight times to discuss concerns and opportunities to ask these questions and nothing was discussed no questions were brought up until it's time to vote we've had two public hearings and nothing was brought up it's time to make a vote if we had concerns we should have been asking them along right along and we haven't I'm I'm happy with this budget I don't think it's overextending I think we need to trust um some of the ination that Tim has come up with I think he's made some money with some Innovation that he's Come Along come along with as far as Investments I'm proud of the things that he's done I'm proud of the department heads we're all proud of what's done I still it is but I also know how I know how high my electricity bill is gone I know how to run every day so we can't expect the town to okay so I'm just I just had to respond anything else okay go to V Kevin not moving on to new business uh I'm going to slide in just before uh item a uh my request to have uh the council vote to approve the license renewals uh that we had the public hearing for and to uh also approve the the uh one time permit that we issued for um move we approve managest motion second second any discussion no go to vote that I Jim I Shane I vot I thanks for letting me slide that in there uh item a is a proclamation so at the end of June the town of Fort Fairfield will lose one one of its most dedicated employees when Ella Leon officially retires from her position as tax collector and treasur for the town of for fa and while the town staff have had the opportunity to celebrate Ella and her service to our community I feel it's appropriate that we as a community as Council and as a manager

right into the budget do we ultimately need to read the notice on today's p uh so we'll start off with the public hearing on the budget and the presentation by the budget advisory committee do we need to read that notice that it was posted that's just part of my protocol oh okay it's however you want to open this session I think public after the after the presentation right yeah but you should introduce your speaker yeah I'd like to introduce Chuck Haworth from the budget advisory committee good evening you guys all have copies of the PowerPoint yes so um and just for note if anybody else need a copy you can get them afterwards so basically the budget advisory committee was able to had the opportunity to meet with the department heads thank you for allowing that we were able to look at the numbers and kind of come up with some recommendations and kind of broke it down to categories that would be easy to for you guys to implement and start to analyze and maybe use as a tool to help you make decisions on the final adjustments that you're going to make to your budget um under the first topic we're talking about Revenue sharing this came back as a very almost a really exciting change for the town and um it was nice that the that the department has had the opportunity to establish the budget before they knew about additional funding that might be available so this kind of led me a lot of freedance to the the discipline that they approach their their procedures with in determing their Pro for each department um the secondary pool as was explain is is tied to the property tax rate so we thought the most important thing coming out of our meetings was really to understand that with this anticipated increase from approximately 1.03 million to 2.2 million that there going changes from year to year and because it's tied to the property tax rate as the increases go and its bu rates decrease it will have effects which really think that we really want to emphasize to each of the counselors here today and to the public at large that tapered adjustments are going to be the most appropriate measure so that you're not doing radical changes to either the no rate or the tax rate or adjustments to the um the taxable base because of the impact that it's going to have the Revenue sharing and so trying to understand that that EV flow and the ratio and how those numbers interact with each other is really going to be critical so taking moderate changes we thought was very prudent in that matter and also because there was such a radical change in the amount of money it would be easy to be like oh we got a new credit card it's time to go spending and I think everybody in this town has been through that already and we're all set with that procedure but we also want to reemphasize the fact that the this future Revenue sharing should not be relied upon for the operational expenditures that we need the budget for those appropriately and responsibly so that we can use that additional funding for critical infrastructure and for and for Capital Improvements going on to Human Resources so there have been a lot of changes from last year budget committee recommendations to this year a lot of the department heads did some incredible things with their budgets to stady keep the numbers low use of part-time folks and and also um in some departments looking for additional resources specifically Public Works looking for additional resources that allow people with less lure to operate Vehicles critical for Town services so I think a a lot of those things U are going to our recommendations for human resources continue that those successes the benefits that we're talking about in the slide are the benefits packages for the employees there's a lot of contract negotiations coming up and we highly recommend that use a a night the benefits package as a as a tool to negotiate those contracts you know you can constantly be chasing that dollar per hour among you know neighboring towns and you'll never win but if you have a nice Ben package combined with a competitive salary and a great working environment that's where we're going to win um contract negotiation negotiations are starting this fall so I think it's important to keep that in mind that the benefits pack should be used as a tool as well in negotiations um retention and uh performance measures proposed increase amount with Town objectives so tying U essentially tying your performance and incentivizing it for making you know goals and whatnot uh we always said you cannot improve what you cannot measure so start to make measurable goals to to determine success and whether you're reaching those goals uh part-time versus full-time strategy this was a strategy that was implemented heavily by um Public Works and also by the police department and EMS this is a great cost-saving measure um and we think it's a a huge um strategy to continue with however it's not going to always fix everything there's going to be needs and those would have to be taken up by Department ads and discussed with um part of the there's always a revolving door there's over always a a turnover in Manpower when those turnovers occur and if we can anticipate them if we know situ certain people are leaving the cross training of those employees to to other employees to cover down on those duties will save not only on their salaries but also on the benefits which get increasingly expensive and we'll deal with that a little bit later on actually next which is Insurance expenses we last year I poor Dan I battled with him to get the quotes down on insurance and he did uh what what has happened if you look at the premiums over the last five years there's been 100% increase in premiums the town is paying and keeping an eye on that and what's driving that is this mod rate and the risk ratings and risk reduction strategies this is something that we really need to get a handle on at a town level and try to drive down those those costs to the town and I mean there's a number of tools we can use but there's some things that are out of control and I know a lot of they handle in the executive session because a lot of the things on the personel so um but definitely keep that in mind that's a huge increase in in costs into building and capital expenses um we had the opportunity to go around and look at some of the problems um that have been that haven't been addressed and have been allowed to get to a point where they really have to be addressed now and those came down to not only vehicles but also the buildings themselves so there's some excellent facilities here um they desperately need to be taken care of otherwise we're going to be Bur with some um very expensive projects so some of the ways to save money we thought with the drmo that spend a success sourcing vehicles from different departments from the state from other agencies to try to save money um has been a real good thing using the the town the paint booth to basically you know do our own that type of work has definitely save money also um looking for vehicles one of the big successes and I put it in there was the you know you to find a vehicle that's not being used or not being used enough to justify its existance and excising that and using those funds to get something that we truly need the track list to clean the sidewalks and that was a great decision by the Town Council we commend it highly um the buildings as we walked around we can see there was there was some problems with every single building there wasn't a single building like hey this is our model home that we're going to take everybody around to and give a for every building had its own priorities a list of priorities and understanding those priorities and those building those buildings need to be analyzed at a deep level and what we need to do first second and third some of them are more critical than others um stuff like the DW the floor drain we have issues that that could be massive so I think prioritizing those are critical um some stuff has already been worked on which is great thank you Tim you know safety issu like the stairs in front of town hall um and then always having the flexibility to have the ability to to react to situations as they occur we have obviously a huge event coming up in the festival something popped off between now and then that was a safety issue having the flexibility to do that is is CRI um uh in there we put that the library group is already is being addressed for this summer which is good I know that we looked at that last year they didn't get finished so um but one big success was that meeting space for those of us that did the tour I think everybody was really really impressed with how that came out down in the basement and I mean celebrating those successes I think is really key to commending the employees for doing such a great job and also sharing with the taxpayers that progress is being made despite what we've gone through for the last couple of years on Emergency Services the police department is looking for additional grant opportunities and we think that's that's probably the most important thing we can do for them is is to focus on getting free or discounted Services there certain things that have to be done like updating their tasers and cameras that's going to be one of those things that's it's required and they're going through a certification process now which basically makes them certified in aeny within the state through a series of protocols and part of that is meeting certain benchmarks and having up toate cameras body cameras and up to date tasers is an issue of safety and accountability continuous Source low cost solutions for Motor Vehicles he's done a great job of that I think we can all agree um from getting vehicles from the state and from the county it's been it's been nice to see that the Cruisers been around town are a reflection of our commitment to our Police Department our commitments Police Department's commitment to the community um and then use part-time employees to reduce overtime he's done an excellent job of recruiting officers that used to be fulltime um into parttime roles and it has saved the town just a considerable sum of money um but that outside the box thinking has been one of the keys to his success we get high quality officers at a at a low cost which is fantastic um firing EMS they've done some great development I think you guys have seen some of the posts lately um but they they need to continue to look for grant opportunities he's found a couple and other working on the pump truck um that priority that needs to be prioritized through the grants effort into the grants and also look into the budget for opportunities to improve some of his Capital expenditures as well um also a possible look to uh additional opportunities to expand Services into surrounding areas he did a great analysis of some of the opportunities for um doing transport services for other communities there's a shortage of transports available um through Caribou um but careful analysis of that these two and it kind of goes into the last bullet which is looking at the the cost benefit of operating Advanced life support versus basic life support you know what is the actual receivables actual not projected but actual receivables versus um you know what is the cost of the additional services so just looking at it for that perspective I mean the trends are really good in the department however we have to continue to keep a close eye on that it's a really big expenditure and it has potential to br lot of Revenue and Mike's done a great job on that debt service and mill rate reduction I think everybody is ready to throw eatsy beatsy side of relief um we were able to reach as a as a town thanks to great leadership um of meeting that February 2024 goal of being debt free on the shortterm um tan Debt Service and all that obviously we have to use Tans that's I'm not saying we're not using those anymore but um we were able to get rid of stuff ahead of the short-term debt ahead of schedule which is fantastic um long-term debt operating Capital um those things the schedule rates are low enough but not prioritized like the bond you have to understand the bond is going to be over is up is complete in four years and starting to budget for that now is and plan for that now is going to be critical going forward on the reserve accounts I know we had a we had a nice talk about this last year um which is like it's great that you have the numbers there but until you have the cash to operate those reserves I think that's important to for people to understand if you could reiterate that where there's a difference between those Reserve accounts and how much cash is actually being allowed to be used that's really important to the taxpayers to explain that difference and also for our department heads to understand that it's not necessarily there with other priorities as well U mill rate reduction we are stun supporters of the mate reduction I think that's probably one of the biggest reasons we have a budget advisory committee um but we we encourage you to continue pursue reductions without sacrificing critical Town Services the department heads have done a great job of bringing stuff down um and they've continued to provide excellent levels of service there's going to be at some point there's a diminishing return for the loss of money for each department and and you we have to weigh like how many more Cuts versus how many more expenses how it's going to Services we're at that at that level now so start to weigh that and keep that in in in the back of your minds as you consider mill rate reductions and also going back to the revenue sharing also keep that in mind as well um in conclusion it's really at the end of the day it's one team one fight everybody's here because they love this town you're not here on the Town Council because you didn't want to see this town succeed the taxpayers and employees of this town are here tonight because they love this town um the budget advisory committee thank you for putting us on it some of us this is our last year on it and it's been a great opportunity to to highlight some of the areas that we thought were important um everybody has to be willing to consider new options including like us and everybody here just open your minds up two ears one mouth listen to each other increase that communication and we will come out of this as one team and we will have a very successful town our commitment has to be for constant Improvement I said earlier you cannot improve what you do not measure you have to focus on the things that you can quantify and measure and and call a success a success and call a failure a fail failure if we try something that doesn't work don't be afraid to call it a failure and move on U we have to maintain our commitment to our town employees I mean we obviously have budget U sorry the um contracts coming up this is one of those opportunities where we get to express that commitment and it doesn't it can be in a variety of um but also understand that the people that are here are here for the right reasons they didn't come here because we have the highest paid department heads or the highest paid employees they love this town and uh we love them so huge thank you to our employees our department heads and we also appreciate the Town Council thank you for your service thank you for You' done thank you Tim and everybody else here so do you guys have any questions uh myself or any the other members that are here tonight I we have one comment yes we have you in the focus of the big picture you made a debt we all have been discussing this and you hit the nail on the head of what we're discussing awesome thank you we've been listening thank you very very nice any comments any other public comments regarding Chuck or our budget no takers yeah motion motion doesn't need a motion you're in charge moderator okay close it fantastic sir move on to the public comment period yep so any general public comments I guess we'd uh we take them two St right up I think he's beaten me two M go for it no no what we discussing yesterday yeah and as as you should no no you've know in a long time I just saw the gar I'm Tony and I'm a resident of fortfield and today is National police officers day and the presidential declaration called it National Police Officers Memorial Day and there's some things happening at the federal level including flags at half sta we didn't get not get a director from the uh governor for municipalities to go to half staff so it never got accom it wasn't accomplished never never happened but I would like to recognize the importance our police officers are to this community and have been since I was a little tiny fell and they brought me home I've lost yes good work to our Police Department y it's a great day I'm proud of it so we had discussed it different I I I'd also just like to just uh recognize or at least uh make part of the record that uh we should be proud of Dave McCrae who served this Council for many many years uh who was a teacher for many of us for driver ed and for biology uh Mr McCrae or should Now call him Dr McCrae as I told him in the grocery store a couple about an hour ago uh received his honorary doctorate from umpy uh at their commencement uh for his commitment to education and service in our communities and I just I think uh it's a it's a great recognition for uh Dave and his many many years of service to students and and growing folks uh and serving his community so I just wanted to to say congratulations to him again and uh and put that on the record should we should we congratulate need to for National cler's week even though she we we certainly could any other public comments then I will take the wheel sir if they're okay so correspondents of reports we have no licenses or permits to have signed uh at this time so we'll move on to the financial report um really starting to kind of see how the year end will tie up certainly surprises come in many many different forms uh but as we look um at our financial situation uh as the financial year comes closer to a close uh we're sitting in a fairly good position um certainly we're always going to have discrepancies with a budget a budget is a is a path is a picture is a is a vision it's a goal right um but it doesn't always uh track just the way you you set it out there um but overall I I think we're going to end the the year in the black which is nice uh we're not curtailing uh departments and trying to limp through to spend everything in July this year uh you know so that's nice um it doesn't mean that we're we're in a great financial position but it just means it's improved um and you know putting together the cash flow those and and analyzing the finances where we're at um even our Financial Partners at the various financial institutions as we seek out Tans uh for next year as Chuck said Tans aren't going away I'd love they lovely if they did the banker and me especially would love if we didn't borrow any money ever um but ultimately um you know even they have commented on one an amazing turnaround that we've had as a community in our finances I was on I had a long conversation with today and um it just feels good to be able to look at that and then look at our Outlook as we project into this next budget cycle of 2425 um I'm it's not going to be a massive surprise utility costs heating costs staff costs insurances if I haven't said that at every meeting I haven't been to every meeting um those really are the areas where we're struggling and it's not just a Ford Fairfield thing uh I've talked to managers throughout the region and those are the areas where where we're struggling um I do think I I I and I did outline in my memo on the financial report one of the reasons one of our insurance lines is out of whack and I found this out after our conversation with the budget advisor committee is we ultimately under budgeted our work comp line by a considerable amount based on what our work comp was projected to be for this year so part of that $27,000 shortfall in that line is just that it it didn't reflect what our true cost were going will be um and that's part of the reason why when we put together this budget that and I've given you folks some updated copies you know why I leave the un uh unclassified miscellaneous kind of separate uh because a lot of those Insurance items we don't get till June 1 uh we get about a 30-day window um we've done all of our renewals everybody's on board to bring us product um and in my meeting with M the answer from them is there's nothing to change continue to do your safety reporting continue to protect your employees continue to invest in facilities and Equipment um but the injuries that we've had sustained from the town this year which will drive our work call not this coming fiscal year but the next fiscal year are basically on and so um it was it was nice to hear that from the insurer and I and I said beat us up this year a little bit because we're set to maybe go down so you may don't beat us up so bad the next year uh when it's set to go up I think our mod rating is going from 126 to 091 this year and then up to7 projected right so um it's just it's just the nature of the Beast and so we'll continue to work with them have conversations and try to find ways to make that work better um aside from that uh like I said I have put out the call for rpce for the tan um we've made some significant interest on our on our excess cash so to speak um though I did shed a tier today as the CD uh came to a close because that 5% uh money isn't always going to be available um but we need that back for our cash flow we can't bring ourselves too short um ultimately um we're doing pretty well um I think you know again our department heads understand our position is continuous we talk considerably about um any excessive expenses always concerned that something could come up and surprise us uh you know uh we had a fire truck uh that broke down over the weekend responding to a call we have no clue what that will cost this but it's one of those two Pumpers that we're just kind of eing them eing by with so it just speaks to why the need to invest in equipment is out there I mean this could be it could be the end of the life that a tanker or maybe it's an easy fix we just don't know um so it's it's always a challenge uh but I'd say overall um you know the financial picture looks pretty strong as we head into the end of the year just not as strong as we'd like it um be nice to have reserves and uh those other things that uh especially at times that banks are paying interest we we do have reserves don't we yeah we do yeah we're working on it so um so that's my financial report any questions comments concerns hearing none I would move on to ask Mr Jesy to set forward and give us an update on what is going on out at our friends at Roost way Solutions good evening Steve good evening counc our last meeting was April 19th U our Reven for the month of March were up 6% above budget our expenses were 88% above budget in March uh we had some problems with the bulldo that need some repairs and N was horrendous expens for the month of March we sent almost 2 million gallons of water to the car District 5 years ago that's what we used to do in a year uh so we're working very hard to find um alternative methods of dealing with the for a couple of reasons one also is that the the mark form is that the federal government is now being preast in a really hard way there's p in that LE there's p p in the people who take care of our Le or if they start regulating and restricting that we may run into trouble with not being able to supply to C because the feedack to high so we're actually looking at some alternatives for that I think hopefully we'll be ahead of the curve we actually working with the company not we know what to do with it we're waiting for regulations from the state federal government on that uh overall our budget for mon March was at 6% over what we projected for budgets we were helped a lot in the month of March by recycle those being up very high uh we were able to sell our metal that month and C was at a new high for a while adapting change R so we are coun on that as regular income we also looked at our Landfield development plan uh we looking at doing a little B of work at the CRC Landfield ahead of schedule uh really because what we found we built our new CS you know now by buying by being a year ahead of of getting the earth work done we actually Sav a tremendous amount of money in earth work so we may able to do that for cover of the first so marks will get to that de be back us for the next meeting and we spoke about the P programi working with on on WE Char batter went B so I think I don't know if we guys should put it in place yet yeah U so we met with Mark and the the fire chief last week um still kind of hammering out the details basically these would be for uh those larger you know cell phone batteries niit CAD batteries uh the rechargeable batteries You' use for like power tools um the there was a misunderstanding on Mr jer's part he thought our fire department is Staff 24/7 would like walk in like a like a desk and that's just not the case we can't just have people walking into the fire department and if our folks are out on the call the fire department is not open uh the other part of it is storage of these nickel ber batteries they'll be stored in a 55 gallon drum with like a glass bead filler put over the top so if they were to catch fire that glass would melt and then suppress it but we don't want that inside the building uh but we also can't have it somewhere uncovered so we plan to utilize the uh old Canan clink we're going to modify that and then the the dump is modifying a lift to be able to pull those drums out so we're not quite to the point we're ready to to do that um but uh we're working on those plans part of that and and actually see if you don't mind me just one other piece so they had sent a truck down to down state to get retrofitted for the for the arm on it and it doesn't have the winch that it needs to pick up these drums which is also the reason that people are going to the igloo to recycle things and they're finding them full they can't pick those iglo up currently so just want to we put the word out on social soci media yesterday just want to reiterate that if you go to the igloo and it's full of not junks or tin cans or plastic don't just dump them on the ground unfortunately that's what some people choose to do um until this piece of equipment is fixed they cannot retrieve those recyclings um and that piece of equipment also plays a role in this this nickel pilot project but we're excited to to partner with them on this the reason for Fairfield was chosen for this pilot project is um the last time I and Mike U and I were talking about this last week Chief ja bear the last time they had fire at the gun we had staff out there for a week so the cost of for Firefield is substantial when these batteries Catch Fire it's not your regular use it and toss it batteries that are catching fire it's these nickel  ones the cell phone ones and and so we've had Three Fires out there that we've had to respond to I believe since Chief J's been back as the chief and that that represents an expense to the town so to be able to recycle them get them out of the race stream and reduce the risk of fire at the at the landfill is good so we're excited to Pilot or help with this pilot we just you know we got to set the parameters uh I think we'll do some intake through the town office itself um but it's also just not for just your regular D and C batteries this is this is these more industrial batteries and not vehicle batteries nothing over pound there's a there's a lot of limitations to it we're not quite at the roll out phase as much as we thought we were um uh I think it was a conversation that was had and then uh some excitement to get this going we really want to work out the logistics so that it works for the town and for residents and for the landfill but it's a good program so so um I ask question um so when these batteries Catch Fire do they cause the Chain Reaction they cause batteries to catch fire oh they cat The Refuge that's in the they hot yeah yeah oh yeah do we one of our employees you had set some demos you could just you take a lithium battery from maybe and just pour water on you can want just so as water F us down through that LE through the landfill it hits these batteries in the landfill and it'll cause the chemical reaction they get hot enough to stop paper combes and Fire yeah it'll it'll save us we think in the long run it'll save us Manpower costs and and the landfill it would save them costs and potential equipment damage and ultimately get these out of the way stream there's a company that recycles them the only cost to to the AWS is the shipping uh this this it's a it's a call to recycle which is the initially started with like cell phone batteries um it's kind of a a manufacturer funded return able program so they they take care of the cost of the actual recycling but for us we do have the freight cost which won't be bor Again by the time by AWS right and should also be noted that that Mike is gr at fire department been working with the landfill to also set us up with the dry there so start on those might so might been very helpful for us up there any other questions thank you good to see you uh a real quick item number or letter g d I said I'd remind folks multiple times that the June Council meeting's been mooned to June June 12 you've been reminded yet again that we will hopefully have our final uh budget vote and our June council meeting on the 12 um item e is an update on undiscovered main so uh it was kind of a joke uh I I think I've been here 3 weeks when I got the phone call from the University M School of Business to work with their uh students on on a pilot program uh yet another pilot program and uh I said you really want to work with the town manager that doesn't know what he's doing and uh and they said well you're the only one that said You' you'd work with us kind of a joke but kind of the truth we ended up being the only town that did participate in this pilot program and I work closely with students at faulty for the from um Oro uh they came up here in January um and we focused our efforts on trying to come up with economic development ideas of utilizing The Rustic River it's a it's a beautiful resource it's an untapped resource that flows to our community um we had our our wrapup um kind of the graduation meeting uh a week or so ago um and they presented us with a a website that they built with different uh amenities tours it's scalable um you know making the river more accessible in the area more U visible and also a tremendous amount of strategies and ID mapping and connecting me with departments all over the state I got to meet a lot of different people from a host of different acronyms uh too many to name um that really were helpful and and I I I joked with them I said if no other Town wants to do to get next to you feel free to come back it was great um so I just i' just really like to take a moment and public uh Dr Jones and and the students from University main School of Business uh for their time effort and energy um and ultimately when we launch our new website we'll be able to incorporate this information but uh it's nice to get those outside eyes partner with those outside agencies and understand all these other things that we can be doing in this Corridor and it really extends so far beyond for Fairfield it looks more at the at the the three communities ccal caribou and Fort Fairfield that are all on the river and then the region as a whole so um it's something that that we look to grow upon uh but I just I wanted to make sure I updated you folks that I had no clue what I was doing I don't know why I said yes there were definitely nights that I regretted it as I sat here very late into the evening working um but in the end I think it was a very beneficial exercise for the students myself and to gain for Fairfield additional exposure um not just with all these departments but also we got a television score around the town I can send you post link like it came up pretty good um so that was a a a really nice benefit and something hopefully we can grow on uh the next item item f is I got a phone call from Pat Troy one of the the two active or remaining members on the town's Arbor committee um I had to do some research um based on the town's records the last time the arbor committee met was in September of 2019 it does look like they were set to meet during Co um in April of 2020 and ultimately some of their efforts were suspended and then after that for whatever reason um they were no longer able to utilize Town resources to meet and they've been kind of working on their own trying to keep the barrels uh downtown full of flowers and watered and uh trees mulched in Riverside Park they're down to two members the council actually nominates the members of the arbor committee um and while they named The Arbor committee they they're really more have turned into more of a beautification committee um they have funds um they're sitting on about $200 in a checking account and about $3,000 in a CD but they don't have life they don't have people they don't have bodies so um they're at risk of disbanding and they had asked me to come to council this evening and uh to publicly seek nominations if people want to get involved it's not a a heavy lift it's planting some flower baskets in a couple places the Riverside Pavilion and downtown but if they don't get some additional help and some nominees from the council um we may lose our Arbor committee and um every little bit that we have in the downtown that helps make it attractive is is important so um I would hope that uh by bringing this forward to you folks and making it public here that uh anybody that' like to get involved is more than welcome to reach out to me uh staff here at the Town Office any coun uh we'd be happy to nominate anyone again I think they meet a couple times a year and it's pretty uh informal uh and we'd be happy to host the arbor committee meetings back here in the town office and assist them as we can um but it is this isn't something that our Public Works GRS are going to pick up a VI if this group goes away uh that is not the mission of Public Works uh and not how we we need to spend those resources um but I'd hate to see us lose a group like this that does one of those things that when you through T and you jeez those are pretty I hate to see that go away so uh I wanted to bring that forward to you uh and I and I think Pat for being willing to stick it out because initially was I we just for done and it's like no please hold on till June we'll bring you some more extra quties if we can so um be happy to to put forth any Anon need that we receive calls here at the town office and hopefully your PO get in as well questions comments can we make a social media absolutely absolutely I don't know if we can get it added to the website or not it's added to the website well it's it's been a it's been a struggle to get the new version launched I've got a meeting with them tomorrow um but we certainly can put it on Via social media okay as well and thank you uh one last item that I had under coron and reports uh I just want to take a moment as well as uh Chief jar to congratulate the four recent graduates from ncc's paramedicine program that currently work for for Fairfield RMS uh and a few of them were nice enough to show up here this evening um and I'd like to congratulate Lieutenant Jack Shannon firefighter EMT Lacy Wallace firefighter medic Matt Beal and paid call a EMT Evan Cormier uh they do a great job serving our community and furthering their education just makes them even more valuable to our community and i' love to just publicly thank them for their service and congratulate them on uh on passing their their their classes so yes abely you guys want your put your taken for the paper I think they should be in T T wrestling no we're running it what you don't know yet is you're going to be fighting him I like it give me a chance uh hit him in the knee under old business we have no old business so we'll move on to new business if that's okay with you chairman you better her excellent so uh I don't want to read too much but in April uh we worked really hard to prepare a request for consideration by Senator Collins and her team for the fal year 2025 congressionally directed spending um historically known as ear marks though congressionally directed spending isn't new spending it's just senators and congressmen can now reach out to agencies that have funding available and assist um agencies within their regions with accessing that funding um through the CDs process um we for has been a beneficiary in the past related to our wastewater treatment facility with the Utilities District um and when I met with uh Senator cullins staff uh both here and in DC um we had been talking about a project that would work to fix um some of our infrastructure here in town um and that has morphed into something different and as I was looking at the quotes to repair facilities and talking to other Town managers who have been the beneficiaries of CDs funding or CDs Awards the challenge with funding through many of these channels is the funding is awarded and then three years later you get the check we're not in a position currently in my opinion and probably the opinion of others that uh our Public Work garage could go another three years with the holes in the roof that a Curr has it's just we can't just wait for that to be fixed because it's going to just make it fix more costly it's not like the buildings imminent to fall down but how much longer do we allow it to go and as I started to add up the number for repairs to the public works garage and we and I talked to Mr Hansen the Public Works director about the cost of a new plow truck it became evident that they were about the same number $280,000 which is staggering that a truck cost that much um but that's kind of where we landed and as I was talking to managers throughout the region we were finding that equipment um funding was coming along in online in shorter time period um we could wait a year or two or even possibly three for funding on the plow truck if awarded but we really couldn't wait for funding on uh on repairs to our facilities we're going to make those Investments as a community um and so we pivoted with their support to uh put forth a grant request for a plow truck that needs to buy America make America or by American by American build American if there's a requirement that that comes with these um the truck price that we got a quote on was $277,200 [Music] Town Council to accept that award and pay that match um that match amount is $69,500 257 is just about the amount of Interest we pay if we bought the truck and and financed it over five years um it's not far far off and realistically uh we can wait for the truck we need to fix our buildings uh one of them is still going to help bu us forward um it is the biggest need in public works we didn't uh go for more expensive equipment because it wasn't the biggest priority um is the budget of the amount for the truck that we have to approve is coming out of which year uh it would come out of next year's budget and if you look uh I don't have it broken down out of uh on that sheet but it's in that budget uh those updated members uh so when we were able to and the floor drain did come up uh the floor drain uh Mr Hansen and his crew in consultation with I believe counselors and a few other folks they come up with a creative solution that they're trying to fix the Flor drain that would be a fraction of the cost um that floor drain that we were looking at fixing was going to be about $68,000 uh so the idea was pivot from floor Jan fix to see if this uh unique usage of uh permeable concrete and uh and stone will work and use those funds instead from fiscal year 2425 as match for this plow truck if approved by Council and if the budget is approved but some for some reason we didn't get awarded this I would still suggest that we hold those funds specifically earmark for Capital investments in equipment for the public works department the need is there and we would find the appropriate use for it um because there is still no guarantee that Congress will approve it and who knows uh usually these things get approved in Congress in October the last time around it got this year got approved last year's got approved this year in March um and then we had about a three week window to put together a proposal um so that is uh that is what how I propos to pay for it uh and how I would proposed to fund it and why I'm seeking your thoughts and approval on this I motion that we approve this uh request any questions discussions all those in favor I I excellent I will send a memo to the Senator's office tomorrow and let her know that we're down to hopefully get a new plow truck it would be the first new plow truck purchased by the town 2002 is the one we purchased that was brand new 2002 what was the price back then dere that was $90,000 and they're they're equivalent trucks they're almost identical should have bought three back then I didn't have gr money yeah it's one of those deals where you buy it and put it in storage yeah thank you um and I appreciate the the conversation related to that and yes why I move that uh the other item under new business that I would seek approval from Council on is the appointment to nmdc uh so in talking with the uh Folks at nmdc and other managers um it became obvious to me that uh historically the town manager or their proxy in their Town serves on the N DC executive board um while we had an interm Town manager we had a a resident serve in that capacity uh they resigned from that position and I've been serving in there pretty much since I've been the town manager um it is very helpful to me to to sit in on those meetings uh I get a chance to understand what programs are out there uh what opportunities are being presented what they're funding for other projects for economic development not just in rusa County mind you but in Washington County Northern P County uh and they're doing a lot more lending and work um and I think it would be vital to to have that see so I would ask uh Council to nominate me to serve on m& executive committee and needing an alternate member uh I thought it would be appropriate to use our Council chair in the event that I wouldn't be able to attend so Mo any questions thanks for that nomination Tim I will miss as many meetings I I can just to see how good alternate you are um fantastic all those in favor I I that is all I have sir very good i' entertain a motion to approve the minutes of the April 17th 2024 council meeting motion that there you go any questions all those in favor I entertain a couple more motions here uh warrants no Warr warrants number 19 the amount $15,804 70 and warrant number number 20 in the amount of $392,900 I get a lot of experience I'm glad you introduced yourself yeah protocol take uh excellent okay uh motion to an executive session okay",True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,P0K7H39y1FI,"FY 24/25 1st Budget Public Hearing May 1, 2024",,53.0,3199.0,2024-05-02T12:06:53Z,none,40,0,0,0,"I can I can open up the public room if you like okay so good evening everyone thanks for coming it's a little couple minutes after 6 if Meer is good to go on her recordings I'll yeah all right we're up to speed so good afternoon so there's a public hearing today and there also be another one as well on May 15th uh this public hearing is an opportunity for uh counselors and the town managers myself to receive comments questions uh on the proposed 20 uh fiscal year 2425 budget um I would go into the the long spiel of how this isn't supposed to be a debate but basically just an opportunity for us to hear feedback from citizens on the proposed budget uh to ask questions uh and hopefully we can provide either answers or look into those uh questions and provide further guidance at another point in time um I don't have a budget presentation per se uh today I've presented the budget three times at this point um I'm certainly happy to answer questions based on it or I can walk through uh I did put print out some overviews just some high level uh numbers on the budget a few of those numbers are adjustments from uh from where we started on March 22nd when we put the budget out um and I will say probably a, more more times but I'm still fairly new to this gig I'm still learning what folks want for me and how they want to hear what they want to hear so I I'm happy to answer any question I can and if I don't know the answer I truly will research it some of us have just received this today yes sir is it possible for you to give a just a simple absolutely this because you may answer questions that we have y I'll walk through this version because that's what you folks have in your hands um and again I did just adjust some of the numbers I was in touch with the superintendent of schools this afternoon uh the school board meeting is this this afternoon as well um and so I have adjusted the school's number actually downward from previous uh from previous estim is that reflected here yes sir yeah it's not a humongous reduction it's a reduction of about uh $7,000 on a $2.7 million request but hey there go the right direction and so we'll applaud him for it um so certainly I'm happy to walk through it so if you're looking at the the handout that I provided uh at the top well I guess that's not going to help um I'm on the one that at the very bottom which have the words projected overlay 98,000 we'll start on that side and I should have numbered these I apologize so this is the expected expenses or the projected expenses of the Town um minus few things so basically the the budget that we would be presenting or I have presented to council calls for a uh 9% increase in total Administration costs uh we achieve that uh budget by a reduction in Staffing of one um cost drivers in the administrative budget are not going to be massive surprises um staff benefits medical those sorts of items so on that line we're fairly close to Flat funded uh moving down to the library line the total Library line is a increase uh I have in there about a $30,000 increase over last year um the goal there is twofold um one to get more hours in the library uh We've increased the number of programs at the library from zero two years ago to uh nearly 70 so far this year um use of the libraryies uh increased exponentially uh I believe there's almost 500 folks that use the library just this past month of April um and so I'd like to reward the three Librarians that are working on that program also they're working on some grant funding and a uh and a new um some external projects including a new community garden uh so that's the major driver there uh the other part of that was uh we also had to move up the the hourly wage on a couple employees because the state of Main's uh minimum wage increased this year so uh I think that's a reflection on the great work our Librarians have done uh moving on to the police department the total Police Department budget uh shows an increase I believe it's just about uh eight or n% the major cost drivers there oh I I was wrong 6.52% increase I apologize uh May cost drivers uh contracted wages through the union and uh the addition of body cameras and police cameras for the Cruisers uh we upgraded that system this year um instead of using flimsy ones that were falling off all the time we've got some uh really usable equipment um it's been a it's been a problem for our department for an extended period of time that we've addressed uh that will not only help for their protection but also for the protection of citizens and for prosecutions under total Fire EMS Department I I want to draw your attention to the fact that the budget line item for the year 2324 at 878 324 is just the EMS Department estimate um it didn't include the fire we were struggling mightily internally to split expenses between fire and EMS because we were trying to pay employees and hours and equipment and it really made for a an accounting mess um so we combined those in the budget this year to make it easier for us to do the work on the back end um but at the same time we should be able to extrapolate and estimate to a very close dollar amount the overall operating costs of those uh departments kind of individually keeping in mind that certain things you can't split you got to have a phone and office um you know trash removal those sorts of things uh Public Works the major increased driver there is an increase in Paving of $150,000 to $250,000 that we're proposing um it has been well noted that last year we paved our first two miles of Road in for Fairfield in 5 years um that puts us on a 39-year Paving schedule currently which is just not good um we're actually looking at because of the weather this year we're looking at a doubling in our cost of patch um the good news is we're getting at it a little bit faster because of the weather we've had this spring but because it was wet and the roads were were tore up a little bit more um we're looking at an increased cost there uh so trying to address that through a Paving program that actually gets us closer to a maybe even a 20year cycle versus a 40 year ccle would be fantastic aside from that I believe the overall increase in public works is about 1.7% Parks and Recreation uh the increase under their their budget actually it's a decrease from 2324 uh but a slight increase from last year uh the budget driver there is a need for some additional part-time Staffing uh to help Doug he's done a great job with his programs he just needs some additional help uh Doug's done some really good things to also moving his office down to the pool uh to reduce the need for us to have a pool director um and putting him more in touch with the staff and the and his employees down there so he basically works at the pool through the summer um other increases in the uh parks and recck line are a lot of uh towards the maintenance and upkeep of facilities replacement of hopefully replacement of some basketball goals in the process um to some equipment needs and facility needs um the total Municipal budget appears to be at 8.45% increase over last year uh some of that is a reduction in debt service but an increase in capital expenditures um we have some tremendous uh Capital needs in this community uh if you came in through the front door you walk past the stairs uh that's an embarrassment it's a tri Hazard um and it's just one example of the of the shape that our community facilities are in um that will be replaced this year under our Capital Improvement plan as with a roof um I'll just go through a couple other items here as you can see our debt service is is down considerably uh down to 161,000 that Debt Service consists of the bond payment on this addition uh which will retire in the year 27 as well as the payment on what is known as the EMS startup loan but truly was a loan taken out to fund ongoing operations in the Years 21 20 and 21 that's just Spirit test um total County budget you'll see there's a pretty flat number there it's a big number um we have a need to pay a special six-month County tax this year um the county has changed its fcal year and will actually go into its next fiscal year July 1 being in in kind of uh line with most of the other municipalities in the area um so we were assessed $175,000 uh County 6mon Special tax which would put the county tax at about $350,000 if you calculated that over the course of a 12- month period I'm hoping the county budget will come in closer to 325 for Ford Fairfield uh I did just receive the county budget yesterday uh via email uh it does not break down what the expected uh contribution from Fort Fairfield is um so that 500,000 there would be the total payment for the towns uh 2425 County tax and a total payment of that special six-month tax um I propose that we pay that six mon tax UPF front and early uh and get it off our book so don't have to deal with it over the next two or 3 years uh there is an option to pay it at $58,000 intervals for the next three years um I don't see that as advantageous to the town at this time our total miscellaneous and unclassified is uh largely insurances and heating costs for the community center um our insurance costs are ludicrous I'm sure most people are aware theirs are as well cost of replacement cost of vehicles and in our case the wonderful benefits of um sustaining a few injuries over the course of the last few years have driven our work comp cost up um I did meet with our work comp uh Representatives uh two weeks ago um our insurance for work comp may go down slightly this year uh before it explodes next year just due to circumstance um our finding was keep doing what you're doing and have safety reports which we are doing uh they really could find no fault with anything that we're doing as an employer it's just people get hurt we have people in dangerous jobs it happens um it actually was a really good conversation except for frustrating because you know that there's nothing you're doing wrong and yet you're still being punished um I guess that's the the fun of using Insurance uh you're going to pay for it in the long run so uh as I mentioned uh probably just before we started up uh the camera here this evening um I did receive an estimate on the school budget and updated one um from the superintendent of schools uh M Staples um their increase is $443,500 from before the $7,000 increase or decrease I got uh this afternoon so just shows all the uh the revenue expenses um I'd be happy to flip the page and then finish up on the other side so on income not a lot of changes on the admin side I am projecting a decrease in exis tax collection uh potentially from um the retirement of a person here in town that runs a transportation company uh but also because I just feel like the economy uh is is likely to soften interest rates are high cost of vehicles are high I think folks will stay in a vehicle a little bit longer and I think that's going to uh Drive our excise tax collection down U moderately um I'm not Nostradamus but everything I read kind of and and the tea leaves that I'm reading when I watch what the town's uh income is kind of tell me I'm probably on the right track uh in terms of copies and licenses uh that all still pretty much stagnant um Library income is next to to nothing that's just from some printing um maybe book finds I don't know if we can maybe go and have the cheek out and find out everybody that's got books that are overdue and and generate some extra revenue on that line I'm not sure um local roads assistance um hard to generated a yes uh I put it in at 100,000 because of last year's 1145 um I don't really want to overestimate what it is because that's always dangerous so I'm being conservative with that $100,000 um there is no crystal ball there is no formula for me to dig into um it pretty much just gets allocated to us um as you can see under the Fire EMS Department we did get a EMS stabilization grant for $98,000 that helps reduce the cost of firings staff uh where we' have been looking at an increase we're actually looking at a decrease in cost on the uh salary line item that decreases about 3.57% uh under the police department income again he's not generating enough in uh income so when the police chief isn't here we make fun of him and that's the important thing to do so uh we need him to do more forfeitures uh Pilots uh all pretty much staying about the same uh those are payments in Li of taxes for those that aren't um aware on our tiffs uh those all uh are pretty standard um and AWS is pretty standard at the at the $10,000 uh Recreation program income really just offsets the cost of doing business on t-shirts and bringing kids to to programming for Doug um potato blossoms pretty much a a wash hopefully uh we bring in as much as we spend on the potato Blossom Festival and then the big Big Driver of the increases in what we see from on the income side and how we may be able to do some of our Capital absorb the schools is on the revenue sharing um as you can see that's a jump of about 1 Point um almost $1.2 million um it's a it's a gift but it's also a recognition that the town has had a um very significant tax burden on taxpayers uh so one of the goals that we had in our conversations with council is to um kind of stabilize our spending um and fix a lot of our infrastructure Reser build back our Capital reserves help out with the mill rate our Mill rates this year are going to change regardless of what we collect for taxes and the reason our mill rate is going to change this year is because we are going to be forced to index um property values property values continue to ride uh extremely high uh we are currently at 88% uh in the state's sales ratio um which is good enough to keep us at 100% reimbursement for this year should we let that slide uh we would not get our full reimbursement for things like tree growth and Betty and the veterans and homesteads um so we have to um index the goal will be to keep the collection of taxes at or below U what we collected out of folks Pockets last year um but again the mill rate component which again doesn't get set till October um and I understand it's the number that most everybody is focused on um but right now I would just say that that's I'm more interested in what's coming out of people's pockets and what we're spending and what the mill rate is and I know the mill rate's going to be set in a way that doesn't um create a situation where we're we're chasing no rate every year um so if we were to uh make a drastic cutting mill rate this year that Revenue sharing would also plummet and then next year we'd be looking at a tax increase and I just I just don't think that's appropriate management I think keeping a very stable level approach to governance to to spending uh making things as predictable as you can over a 2 to threee period uh despite all the outside influences that are upon us um both as a municipality and as as taxpayers uh make that really uh a challenging situation um and that's why again going back to the other side of the sheet why I propose that we pay the family tax in full and why uh if you look down further that we we do a slight mill rate reduction and uh invest heavily in our uh Capital Improvements this year I do show projected overly of 98 ,000 I'd love to tell you I feel comfortable that that's the real number um but everybody that's ever done a budget knows a budget is just a road map it's not a it's where we hope to land uh it may not be where we land I also think that there's some potential to have a conversation about maybe increasing what we're doing on Paving to do a bigger project overall um and I also think we have an opportunity potentially presented to us through CDs which is congressionally designated spending that gives us an opportunity to um buy a plow truck our first new plow truck since 2002 um if we are rewarded that um and right now we don't have reserves so we don't have the match that we would be required the cost of that match would be almost the same as the cost of interest on that ploud truck over five years so um it behooves us to look at that um as an option so I know I spoke a lot I'm losing my voice so I'm going to take a sip of water and and breathe some air uh and then I'm happy to answer any questions you folks may have or um yeah go from there or at least take your comments I guess I don't know if I'm supposed to answer questions but I'll do what I can so this Sir Mr sway or I'm not I'm not sure if I'm supposed to address you or the I'm not sure well you've been to this Rodeo longer than I have Gary so for a while yeah fair enough I reviewed the numbers yes sir I have some concerns otherwise I wouldn't be here okay I looked at the proposed budget as compared to the actual estimate for 203 24 I think we all could agree that inflation rates R 3 or 4% Administration is up 4.4 so I congratulate you on that you can know you're loosing one employee but 4.4 is Library ask concern with us 48% increase 48% not sure we can sustain that not a lot of dollars not a lot of dollars and I don't know the full usage of the library but I look at the numbers least 8.5% substantially inflation rates and you've explained they need some equipment I don't know why they can't get grants for some of that equipment but hopefully they will apply for Fire EMS I have a real problem 48% that's a big number it's a big percentage and it's a big number Public Works 18% a lot of that is Paving God knows we need a need Paving Ro I'm saying going to tackle that one S I heard that too I didn't push for it I heard that though he's moving just in case it's a fun it's a function of relationships okay yeah since he's on the board they're going to GL Park and wreck 11% I don't know again I'm not here to judge the people that in these departments that's Tim's job Tim's job and your job a scrutin Tim okay so if if that's done it's fine but total of Municipal is up 10.9% from last year budget at 10.9 with inflation running 3 to 4% that's worrisome to me anyway it's woron County budget you've explained that to me it's 69% but we catching up understand that unclassified I don't understand what's in there up 105% I just don't know what's in there uh it is a lot of insurances it's a lot of your utilities and heating costs just a second I'll I don't expect any answers tonight I just wanted to point out my observations and my concerns school budget 20% down another 7,000 congratulations on that but I don't know how many students there are in that school department I don't know how many employees they have whether or not the counselors have attended meetings for school budget it's tonight at this time I'm sorry it's tonight at this time at this time there's a higher enrollment at the school right now there's been a number of years I don't know those numbers okay so I apologize but I'm looking at 20% increase for the town's share of the school budget there was Co funding that's decreased and away for them as well I understand part of I understand too that a lot of the co money was spent really nearly not necessar for students not necessary the building itself but again that's hear say and I'm not here to tou that all I'm here to say is that 20% is a big increase this community to pay total expenses compared to last year 11.2% Revenue sharing up 114% I'm concerned about what happens next year and year after and fully aware of that yes sir I don't know what you can do about it but it's a big big number on the other side of the equation Revenue High EMS Revenue we to actually the budget down 23% I don't know last year we talked about a different billing method a different company that doing the billing and we're going to make more money it's not there it's just not there I don't know less usage less transfers I don't know what it is but the numbers bother me so those are my concerns and and I can't I can't address the specifics what of you folks can but when I look at the numbers I'm drifting back into an area where we can't afford to pay the government expenses anymore like we were two years ago I'm not saying it's that bad don't get me wrong it can't ever be that no I think I think some of the numbers that you also are looking at um especially when it comes to like budgeted uh ambulance Revenue were not realistic projections I think they were put in place to make the budget look better and and I hate to say that because I I think that makes people feel thicky or bad but I believe that's the truth very well be yes sir again that's your job to car it out and find out what happened and how come if the number for this year is the actual number then realistically we got to think about can we afford that PR EMS Department that's when you look at cost per capita okay and that's one way to look at it I don't know if it's sustainable anyway I said all I wanted to say I appreciate your time and I challenge you to do to do a good job on reducing the expenses and increasing the revenue thank you Gary thank you I'm going to keep those stares from being fixed scary and right there is a revenue generator for us what's that they said I'm going to I'm not going to fix those stairs that's a revenue generator for us no I'm I'm sorry I should I shouldn't joke about that who fixed the last set of stairs uh it was a patch job no last I I had no idea what it cost it took a year and a half to do it yes I know that it was forever to get it done yeah but some of those things like that are critical Tim it's like it's like my you think guard rails oh on a courier trust me you got you got those guard rails in budget if I could slide those in he wouldn't be here three areas that need guard rails fth Avenue and Marsh Road I mean dang very dangerous the cost using used material is not very prohibited from what I heard the great the proposed cost to fix the the drainage in the highway department was estimated to be at $60,000 I guess the real fix is going to be hell a lot less than that maybe there's some extra money there for God I knew he was going to get a shot that just shows to the good work that's done by the department has been figur things out oh absolutely yeah without increasing it's it's tough it's tough thank you for your comments Dar Mr tol sir good thank you everybody um just want to say a couple things obviously Co I think we're all tired of hearing about Co everything that happened during Co and there was a big infusion of money that came to towns and schools during the co period and my outside looking in on that I think a lot of that money that was meant to be covid money for Co period got built into budgets I think decisions were made money was spent and allocated to increase budgets and now what's happening is all you got to do is look at the newspaper the school all around the state and the country are crying poor they're having to cut people a lot of money was put in there those budgets were increased the money's pulled away a lot of that money in my opinion should not have been put into the annual budgets it should have been allocated for specific purposes to deal with covid at that time what's happening now is we're reeling from the strings of that money being pulled away so so when I see a budget and I see things like an extra $1.2 million in Revenue sharing and you're thinking about somehow infusing that money into the budget that's a onetime expenditure $100,000 that's given through a grant to offset the cost of payroll one year what happens next year I don't think we should be looking at kick in the can down the road these are tough decisions that have to be made school's going to make tough decisions they're talking about lay people off those are the decisions that have to be made when all of a sudden the money is gone and we've already been through this and I don't I don't even like coming up here and talking about this stuff I see what I see I understand what I understand I think we really have to pay attention to this one time money that's infused and I think we still need to figure out what do we do now that the money's gone and if you take a look at our budgets The Last 5 Years you look at where we were 5 years ago before Co and look at where we are now a lot of that was because Co money was infused budgets increased money's gone what's than thank you Tom thank you I to thank you for going this I I haven't been here for a long time I want to share their comments I I just try to look at it quickly I'm just going to hit a couple of things what's bothered me is like Tom mentioned the revenue sharing what happened if we didn't get the million dollars it would be a million dollar short could happen so there are things in here I'm sure that are one time costs yeah perfect yeah one income pardon or one turn inome yes U I have a little problem with the the fire the EMS but I always had because we spent a lot of time on that the last three years how much money was wasted it was we never could figure out whether re receivable or cash or what we had and they were supposed to have a new system was guar mention I don't know if it happened but you got another $100,000 that you wouldn't have so there's fluff here but what's what's going to be hard is Tom said you're going to have to dig deep or you're going to back go back the same old way and remember old saying he he who fails to he the pass repeats it everybody wants money and they need it everything's going up we all know that our own budgets or anything but we got to think smarter and we got to get better organized we got to utilize our assets better our we got more Pooles in this town I think anywhere in rate especially you drive all en Force down go to the country but there's limited budgets but I think we got to tighten up a little bit and think of how can we save here and and still provide our people you I want itless I'm 82 years old I might need it tomorrow but and I want it I call I want it but some things we can't afford we've got to come to grips with this so and you you've got some work to do on your Highway and your physical plant up there you know things and it's expensive doesn't let go too long yeah but they got to be addressed and it's not an easy decision yeah so like you said support you but it's just some things to me on I'm on the other side that I just saw kind of reoccurring nightmares we had for the last three years yeah the goal of utilizing that Revenue sharing is one using it on one-time expenditures so Capital Improvements mill rate reduction paying off the county tax um not increasing Staffing level we improving you know blowing up services but I certainly I certainly feel your concern there because uh it would be a very difficult budget if that was not there with a you know all the other increases that are arriving our our budget so yes sir then what happens next year if you get back down around $900,000 to a million dollar in Revenue sharing we lose that 1.2 are we prepared to look and face that problem when it happens next year yeah I think we are I mean part of what what we wanted to budget into this was those fixes when we could do them right so things like repairing the Public Works garage so the roof doesn't collapse uh putting some additional funds into Paving uh so we'd have to reduce that uh paying off the county tax now while we have the cash rather than kicking that can down the road um it's kind of cumulative that way um would it be tough yeah yeah it's going to be absorbing the school hit and I'm not blaming the school like we are all up right um but that that would be even more difficult I think that's the hard part of it excuse me is is how do you how do you budget for that how do you and then extrapolate that out I'm not as concerned about 2025 26 as I am concerned about 20 seven eight nine like once you get beyond the next twoe cycle um and that's really where I wonder how sustainable our budgets are right the last thing I want to mention is that these meetings last year it was mentioned by Mr Foster that hopefully in fiscal year 2425 there was going to be a little bit of relief for the taxpayers this one mil talk about one M yeah one full Mill and maybe maybe able to address that more the concern I would have is if you reduce that more then you're going to guarantee that precipitous drop in Revenue sharing so i' I'd rather utilize the funds now to fix facilities and try to establish a little bit of reserves because our reserves are zero um then I would say drop it three Mills knowing I'm going to have to jack it up for next year like that just I just don't want to get into mill rate yo-yo so I do want to have relief but I think it has to be measured relief or you're going to find yourself boun bouncing back and making an increase the next year just to stay even and and and that's I can't extrapolate out another year further because I don't know what the state's Revenue sharing projections will be you know in 20 25 26 so I'm really cautious and and that's why I'm really concerned about trying to make sure we have one-time costs and try to address and fix those issues that are Myriad throughout the town um and I would another thing on the percentages um we all budget differently um I I do want to point out that uh part of the way I budget is I don't Budget on a 2080 work week I Budget on a 2120 so that is also driving some of my costs because you do have a 26 typical year 26 pay checks but some years get a 27 and I don't want us I I don't want us to fall into a situation where you don't budget appropriately for that 27 paycheck um and some of that's based on your payroll providers so I've artificially inflated some of those numbers by changing the calculations because I want to be even more conservative with our numbers and make sure that we're we're putting out a true picture of what our expenses are um and another major thing that we're changing this year and and some of it is is is organizational change we have a history as a town of putting our expenses in the wrong lines because it keeps us under budget in all of our lines and so we AR and haven't historically generated a true picture of expense and it drives me crazy because you know tires and tubes aren't office equipment and know water deliveries aren't office supplies and so we don't we don't have the truest sense of what our actual numbers are because historically it's been if I need a new laptop and I had room in my I don't want to pick on any department but let's see repairs budget I buy the laptop onto repairs and I call it repairs and now we're not tracking true expenses so um that's been a major change and and a and a a point of um I don't want to say confrontation I think our department head finally understand uh but it's definitely taken five six seven months of conversation to get folks to understand that I don't mind if you go over a line in your budget it's the overall budget I don't want you to go over um and so when you work with those numbers that have been manipulated from the past and then not true even just because of the way we've historically done it um it makes for some real challenges in extrapolating out what those expenses are um but I do think it's important to point out that that it it looks like an additional expense and I and I don't know if it adds up to a whole percent or not but I do want to make sure folks understand that I I because of the way I budget I want I want to see true expenses and I want to I want to know what the what's the worst cost that could be when it comes to Staffing or um and then from there work backwards um when I do a cash flow on this I show uh I show us in the Black coming out of this next year not having to rely on our tan this year going into July I'm looking at dipping into our tan that month you know I mean that's just ugly we're we're living on payday loans so um I think there's more relief in this than it looks and appears but also my numbers aren't going to jive with previous years because I don't I don't believe all the previous years's numbers on some of these things I compare them to the actuals that I have in the office and I really I've really tried to fine tune that process um but it's scary it's a scary process like I said when you look out three four five years and you see that you know our spending went this way when the cost of everything went that way and you're trying to catch back up on that yet to at least just be in line with where expenses are um we did our no ourselves no no no service by not addressing needs as they occurred and hiding those needs and so it's um it's daunting it's exhausting when is the indexing going to go into effect this it it would go into this October's this this October okay so is it gonna be part of the formula this year yes for the budget uh no I won't have that for the budget I won't just like I would will not be effective then indexing that would be for next exactly but it would be you would see the mill rate drop but I I I just don't believe in saying hey your mill rate went down and let's celebrate if your tax bill goes up you know what I mean the goal is to hold the tax bills steady or reduce them overall but mill rate is going to change and it's likely to go downward because your indexing is going to see your values are up but that's not for this year it would be in this year's tax bills in October it would be in this it would be in this year's budget in your in your tax bill but again we don't set the mill rate till October so yes sir just for clarification because everybody gets caught up in the mill rate yes sir they do so we talk about tax relief for tax payers It's a combination of the two you have mill rate you have valuation so if you're indexing right I assuming the indexing is going to be going up yes has to do mill rate we're looking at a potential maybe a one M decrease maybe that's on that's on spending Tom don't confuse the mill rate in spending I'm talking about bot line of the budget right but it's dollars that we should be focused on because because the mill rate we can manipulate right based on valuations um and I think that's the part where we get and I the city of caribo last year Dro its mill rate like six Mills tax bills went up 15% we had the same thing happen here the re so while the mill rate is important and I'm not going to say that it is not what's more important is what's coming out of your wallet right what's coming right and that's what that's the number I'm most focused on it's how do we index that and try to keep that that out of wallet cost at or below last year's level because because the mill rate's already going to drop because of indexing so but we also have in here the ability to drop that further but we have to be careful in in extrapolating that because then we could drop our Revenue sharing so precipitously that then you bounce back and have to drop up your bill rate the next year I just I don't think anybody wants to do that yoyo you know let's say we dropped it three Mills your Revenue sharing drops $800,000 we can reduce spending by $600,000 but there's a $200,000 increase you're up a midle and I just I don't I don't want to see us play that that mill rate game because I think it I think it's dangerous and it's it's misleading um I hope that makes sense comple we understand the same thing Y when you index values go up correct so bottom line what a taxpayer pays for a bill even though you're saying it might be lower right indexing means you're paying more on the value of the property which means are you really getting a break under your taxes that's the point I'm trying to make right but it should be you'll see that in the dollar amount right that's the goal but yes you're going to say oh my gosh the mill rate went down but my tax bills the same and that may be the outcome um but I I think that's the key is is don't don't get caught up in the mill as much as what that total dollar out of pocket cost is because that's really what I want to that's where taxpayer relief is I don't care what my mill rate is I want to know how much of a checkout stroke in the town of Fort Fairfield right um it's the same with going out to eat or my grocery bill what's a gallon of mil cost right like what's the actual cost so I I think we're on the same page though Tom yes it you will see that good down what we have to be careful with is is if we bring that down artificially we could harm that Revenue sharing in a way that requires us to then try to go back and fix it just just to stay even or even below even and that's it's a real challenge I I don't I don't quite know 100% exactly how that indexing will work to keep us in a way that keeps that from from causing that Spike downward that thing could cause a spike upward and if we can minimize those um the better for everybody terms of predictability and total cost but I think that's one of the things we haven't had stability we've been here and here and I just I'm I'm really concerned about that very sensitive to it Mr sear sir good evening for the record Charles sear three Hamilton Avenue um you're probably not going to like this Mr sway I'm going to ask for more money I've got a solution all right did you win a lottery my interest tonight is to request that you revisit the amount appropriate for economic and Community Development which is $22,100 which as I understand is what Mr Le gets paid to monitor the Community Development block grant program now we all know there there's two ways to generate Revenue it's either to increase taxes or increase Revenue uh that the town generates I think we all prefer that we increase the revenue so as such I I propose or I encourage you to reach out to the city of prescy and an attempt to share their economic and Community Development person director I believe they they're still in the process of a hiring that person um this job share position could work one day week year and we would pay 20% of their salary and benefits now I Envision this person uh to have a background in marketing grant writing Community Development block grant uh awareness that could incentivize programs to encourage the retention expansion relocation uh or creation of new business within for Fairfield right my expectation is that this person would be worth their weight in gold by bringing in Grand money you know looking for other business to relocate come in start new businesses to help someone to start a new business so therefore I would urge you Council to get on the phone tomorrow to the staff in Pascal see where they are in their hiring process and see if they would consider consider sharing this person with us before you finalize your budget so thank you for your time and consideration thank you thank you any other comments questions concerns or anybody know good joke I public corre I don't think I want to share it though Republicans and Democrats and independ I'm Steve spr I live at 138 con again not to uh take council's time but I'd like to expound what Charlie said about the development part of that I don't see how that would not be a critical part of moving forward I'm not an NBA or anything like that but I I see the struggles that are going on year I've been here and I think that would be a great start for us especially on the revenue side um other than getting money through taxes so again just to support what Charlie put there thanks Council and and your good luck in your position too but appreciate what everybody does thank you anyone else any other questions thoughts concerns before we close this public hearing Council chair I'd like you to answer one of the people I met on the streets asked the question how come we did uh Fourth Avenue I thought that was a state road and you explained it to me today explain that again so the the question was why did the town of for Fairfield PVE the the section of for have that we paved last year and the answer is the town uh owns the section from Pedro to the Town Line in East that is for fairfields road that is not a do road so we paid that section uh one because of the horal shape horrible shape it was in uh too because of the safety concerns we had with a couple blind Corners there Bish buggies to be honest uh that was really one of the extra concerns that we had so um that was the decision of the Public Works director and um it's nice to drive that section of road I wish every other Road in for Fairfield was like that um but that is the reason uh the DOT road actually curls onto paig Road and ends at dorsy Road out at lson Pond um always uh try to remind folks that if the road is striped it's usually a do Road so that that is a good general rule of thumb Gary would say if the road has guard rails it's also a DOT road but that's we don't want to be down there anything else anyone thank you no not a problem I appreciate everybody hanging in there with me for this it's been a learning experience no budget is perfect no process is perfect um but we continue to work through it and and I appreciate the uh the level of insight cander and discussion that we've had and I appreciate everyone coming out tonight thank you if this okay with the chair we close the meeting at 654 yep thank you thank you everybody thank you thank you call I'll talk to",True

amen amen Al to the flag of the United States of America and to the repblic for it stands nation under God indivisible liberty and justice for all okay public comment period floor is open yep come on y state state your name please and I did not know I was limited to minutes so I prepared a five minute speech try to talk fast but the prayer really has inspired me to go off script uh first I'd like to introduce myself my name is Ruth Abigail Miller I go by Abigail and I'm a resident of Fort Fairfield name I gratefully acknowledge the native peoples on Whose ancestrial homelands we have gathered on as well as the diverse and Native and vibrant native communities who make their home here today may we all recognize we are Duty bound to honor their enduring connection to this territory as we have this council meeting on their unsighted lands and the just talking about being true and just Mr Keith I apologize I do not know how to pronounce your last name but I unfortunately was dropping EES when you and Mr Tony was having a chat and I think you were advised wrongly and I urge you for transparency I urge you for transparency so let me get back to why I'm really here I usually don't come to Gatherings with this many nicely dressed people unless I ever B with it this is a little different starting now being mentally ill it's hard for me to make a point straightforward but I'm going to try to I have PTSD 911 changed my entire generation my husband felt HonorBound to protect the American dream freedom and democracy all the buzz words in your prayer and on your nightly news he served two combat tours in Iraq he was a machine gunner in the United States Marine Corps the couple years after his last combat tour he struggled greatly with PTSD which was further compounded by the revelations of fact when the misinformation machine of that Middle East conflict was exposed ultimately my husband went outside leaned up against a tree and died by Suicide just six weeks after walking into a VA Clinic pouring his soul out telling them he couldn't sleep he was having flashbacks and he was going to kill himself I lost so much more than a husband that night I lost my best friend my sanity and the hope for the future of this nation now that you know about the worst night of my life two weeks ago on the second worst night of my life I had to do something that is statistically a risky choice for many people living in America I had to call the cops one of my family members was missing my brain immediately convinced me that they had wandered off into the woods and hurt themselves just like my late husband I was in the midst of the worst panic attack I've ever had I don't even know how I kept myself from fainting the dispatcher that night was so annoyed with me it made everything worse he couldn't even Fain empathy as I pleaded to him all he could muster was a calm down may I never learn his name because it is forever mud a fort Fairfield Police Officer arrived at my house and immediately recognized that I was unwell I said to him I'm having a panic attack tell me what to do that officer never told me to calm down he gave me clear concise directives on my role in the situation in addition to effectively communicating with me and the other people who've now arrived at this situation he gathered data for me a panicked person this officer aided my family who was thankfully safe and returned home this officer's character and training kept me safe that night and ensured that my family had a positive resolution to a scary situation to an untrained officer a frantic wild woman could likely be subdued so that they secure the scene and do their job I'm appreciative that Fort fairfields officers are trained the day after the incident I went to the police station and had the pleasure of running to the chief of police I let him know his officer's Behavior was the first positive interaction I've had with police in over two decades I let him know his response to my panic and inquired about the training they had the chief informed me on the spot that all his officers are required to have CIT training which is training for Crisis Intervention I hope I'm preaching to the choir here today but I felt compelled to come here as someone who is hypercritical of all of Authority especially those with Badges and guns and I have to say Chief Cummings is a community servant before he is a chief the community outreach the call to Serve and Protect the desire to be well prepared and trained these are all things being afforded to Fort Fairfield because a high because of High Caliber human beings with honor and integrity that have decided to hold themselves to a standard higher than the law the cops are not by the law to protect us there is no law that says the police must ensure we are safe in fact there's precedent letting them off the hook for citizen safety waren be the District of Columbia I think we are all aware of what's going on with the missing person in wasburn chander Cole is a dirty cop and I'm glad he's being held accountable by the county of arusik this council's support and funding of police training and Outreach is integral to keeping our department from ceasing to exist or Worse falling prey to toxic culture we don't need military-grade Weaponry we need CIT training and community outreach let us not remain passive observers let us commit to advocating for resources for mental health support services and Crisis Intervention training for our Law Enforcement Officers again and finally I hope I'm only validating everybody up here by saying we have a good group of humans who have dedicated themselves to our community and we must support them thank you for your service to our community thank you for the free therapy and may you all please not consider me a boot Lipper I'm just here to call a spade a spade and the human behind me is an honorable human who Fosters Community Health and Wellness thank you Chief Cummings for giving me a reason to say something nice in public and thank you Tony for proving why I don't come here thank you thank you Abigail we we're glad to back our back our chief and of our departments as a whole I'm happy to hear that and I hope you will remain transparent yep thank you thank you anybody else not after that excellent so under correspondence and reports we have no licenses in permits to bring forth today so we'll move right along to the financial report and uh March was an interesting month and and I always try to just point out some of the trends that I see in the process I I do s along our summaries and we're within our budgeted goals on expenses and revenues but uh one of the thing I guess really I feel like sometimes what I the financial report is an opportunity to to speak beyond the numbers to what I'm seeing um and we start the month of April with an uncollected balance of nearly $24,000 and that means we've collected 99.48% of all property taxes due by the first of the month what concerns me is that we have a a larger number than normal of taxpayers of properties that have lean waivers placed on them so the properties don't go tax acquired um and and as I mentioned in my memo I don't really want to go too far down the rabbit hole but uh because of changes of the process for the town to um you know basically sell off uh you know uh tax acquired properties um we're going to have to really look long and hard at at this Pro uh process moving forward um I think we have removed a major incentive for some Property Owners to pay taxes and I worry that it will create a situation where other folks look and say um you know everybody's not paying their fair share they won't so again just one of the things that I had kind of noticed in those numbers it's not a huge substantial amount but as I talked about other managers throughout the county uh it does sound like we're um on on the side of the higher side of that anomaly uh other revenues uh Homestead veterans trigger out the Betty all are higher than estimates Revenue sharing remains on Pace uh and we did get this all bump for local roads excise tax is still uh kind of lagging behind go but still looks like we're probably hit about where we were projected uh I do want to also start to talk a little bit more about cash on hand I I remember when Mr Ryner was the town manager I didn't get a chance to work for Mr Foster but Mr Ryner was very big on making sure Council was understanding of the cash position that we're in uh so at the end of March we had approximately 1.2 million on hand um with 100,000 the checking 850,000 in our IC uh and another 300,000 in a in a short-term CD that IC and the CD both were earning interest and should put us well above our projected goals when it comes to earning interest uh speaking of expenses uh we are right on track uh saving in certain areas to try to offset other areas where we're having some higher uh costs um certainly putting it to our count um staff through their Paces in terms of training um really really um kind of pushing a lot more training as we've had some staff changes uh so that's one area where we're a little out of uh out of budget uh utilities and phones both seem to be very high not exactly sure why the phones are so much more above cost so something we'll have to look on uh but we've offset those uh expenses with heat and electricity costs um and ultimately that's something we're going to have to look at is it replacing agent infrastructure when it comes to some of our energy expenses um I mentioned in my memo that I was going to meet with uh mic the town's work comp um administrator and I have a better understanding of why our work comp line is uh above budget um it really isn't about current issues it's about what we've uh experienced in the years past um so we do expect to see our work comp cost uh modify some before they Spike uh the following year because we definitely have had some uh unfortunate injuries to to good staff this year um but I have a better understanding of how the that process works uh what's driving those cost um even our insurance say there's you know unless we bubble wrap everybody we just can't prevent some of the incidents that have occurred um and actually came out of that meeting with a very good review uh so hopefully we'll be able to work with mimic to uh potentially shift some of that burden that we're going to see in two years into this next year and maybe not make that such a a wild swing because right now we're set to drop and then Skyrocket uh overall very good shape as we head in the final Court of the fiscal year here uh hoping we can hold on to more of our cash on hand so we don't have to dip into the tan so early in the beginning of our next fiscal year as we work on capital projects uh but overall things are Trucking along looking pretty good any questions or concerns on that than not a problem up next we'd ask Mr reest come forward and give us an update on what's going on on out Solutions J sir C uh we last met on March 29th uh first order of business was to approve our 2023 AIT and that was committ to us with no negative finds at all so we were PR sham uh going into the end of March when beginning of April we were a little bit behind by 9% on our estimated revenues coming in but our expenses were down by 6% so we're in pretty good shape it's pretty normal for this time year to happen um I like to kind of update the council in the town some of the things that Mark does is above and beyond what we normally expect for uh in his update to us um he's he's been looking at some of the State Legislative issues that are coming up to you buy a packaged product the bubble pack plastic the state of main is on the cutting edges of somehow making it so the manufacturers have to pay for some of the recycling of that so Mark stay involved in that committee to make sure that it doesn't affect us and could possibly help us some if those revenues start to come back to the landfills he's also on the state's um climate Waste Management task force uh they've met and hav really produced anything uh substantial yet but he stays on that for us uh he's also looking at a new bill as P State Legislature for food recycling waste for food recycling waste we don't really I'm not sure how it's going to affect the C county yet because we don't have really big uses of the foods other than what comes out of the school system today but it's better for us to stay on top that in we need to be per to was from by state mandate uh we're also looking for a new phone system um we've been having some trouble with Consolidated lines out here for a long time it's gotting really hard for us to work with the Pres When Calls back uh we haven't really decided anything yet other than we tabled it took a l to get some more vendors to come back and give some bids than our current supplier um on good BL side the scrap bids came in at $90 a ton which is really quite a good number for scrap metal um and in the other discussions that we had were with four own communities in there Mark was really concerned with that if they all did the town clean the same weekend it would really ener in the landfill so the four towns coordinate so that we don't over the landf we questions thank you very much thanks Ste thank you Mr Sir uh item D under uh this section of our meeting is the pool pump update and uh I am very very happy to report that we were able to salvage not one but both of the pool pumps that were unfortunately submerged due to a water main bra uh we don't have a final cost estimate yet on uh the repairs um but it's going to be substantially less than the $10,000 replacement cost that we feared uh and the pool should be ready to open on time as scheduled this summer so uh very good news on that FR uh very excited that we went that round uh up next I would ask uh Mr Foster and Mr tole to come forth and present a presentation on Friends mon more thank you Tim uh my name is Steve tol I am a resident of Easton I ask permission to speak on I I thats of lond are organiz organization within the town represent therefore you have standing bu standing feel better you're a boy heart too right you're a for boy heart I still believe yeah East and for games are very interesting yeah I want to bring you uh a little bit of the the history and I'm going to keep it brief because I I could this has been a two-ear uh Journey uh we're a long ways from the from the finish line so I'm I'm going to start off with our what we had written two years ago when we first got started the introduction a couple minutes on that and then give you two items that uh took place last year you were familiar with one of them most of them actually so and then then we'll take over when we get to the there's always money involved with with these things so we we have uh dedicated volunteers with uh we've got time we've got people and a little bit of money to work with and soon to be more money to complete the project uh an introduction in 2022 mson Pond is a unique residential recreational and Water Resource asset located in Fort Fairfield Baine since the early 1800s when the stream was damed to form mil Pond it served in the area in many ways it is also a component of the town's uh backup water supp the town with several federal agencies currently use and support uh support the use and management of this water body friends of wson pond is currently a 501c3 nonprofit created to explore opportunities in studying and assist in the community based involvement to improve this Water Resource the Pawn's current impaired qual Water Quality quality classification is due to Clarity issues resolved oxygen SL phosphorus levels unwanted vcation and other parameters has raised Community concerns about this valuable Water Resource we have 14 member board elected back in March of 2022 we just a group of area volunteer citizens variety of backgrounds and interest we will listen study advise educate and ass with the management of the pawn and in bold without regulatory or enforcement agency we are not The Regulators or the enforcement agency Vision mson Pawn as a healthy ecosystem for the benefit of all residents in users a mission is provide a forum for all stakeholders to study plan and enhance the resources a bun in thought to identify strategies and actions that will provide hopefully long-term benefits for all to enjoy and it's funny we had we put some planned actions back back then and as look down through them and we're two years into it doing some grant writing we were spot on the things we plan to do what you'll be hearing about here in the future is uh of the things we have to do Uh current directors of the directors of that time were myself Dan Mary Fowler Phil Christensen Bruce fling Dave McCrae John hstr Kevin peler Master Kavanaugh John Foster lywood r r I'm sorry Lynwood winow Matt Saunders Tim G and Evan son and we identified stakeholders at that time obviously the town of Fort Fairfield Fort Parks and Recreation or fa for utility district the Shoreland owners Watershed land owners fishermen recreational water users Eco tourists our technical support to date has been through Lake stewards of Maine the nrcs main Department of Environmental Protection Central otic Soil and Water Conservation District ifw in the main Force service that shell that's kind of who who we are where we came from and we're just friends of Monon Pond I hope you too will be friends in mson pond and we're in a a campaign now to produce um Communications uh via print uh via the website to let more people get involved you as uh and your family anybody else that comes out it's a pretty neat process and if you haven't been to the pond lately go there see what a valuable resource that is I grew up on the pond been there for years and years and years just it's it's still there little pwn needs some help so two two things I'd like to point out before Dan jumps up here uh Watershed survey our Watershed is about 13 in Fort Fairfield 23 in in East uh we did a watershed survey boots on the ground going around to the different areas trying to we had technical help to do this people from De nrcs told us how what to look for how to write it up and do it that was done uh May of last last year and we had a report from that which is going to go hand in hand with Dam's what he's going to say about procur money to okay we did the survey now what the heck can we do how do we do it how do we go about that to it and then a second item that was very interesting last year probably the number one concern complaint uh that I hear is I with all the weeds in the pond you can't hardly float but you float real well to get a boat through it is it's something else so um we had Lake stewards of main come up in host a training program for invasive plant species and I don't want to say in hopes of discovering but just what's this stuff in the pond and very educational when it was all said and done we we would have written the I don't want to call it clean bill of health but luckily the 27 total species of of plant life in the pond all belong there they are aquatic species native to the area no invasives and we went from Shore to Shore from the entire length of the pond and very very interesting report so I was initially discouraged by that God what do we do now well there are other things we we do and uh it's going to be chasing chasing phosphorus the plants there that's the that the nature the pond used to be just a swamp with a brook three T tributaries a brook coming in from Canada blows out ends up in the RO but put a dam in front of it all of a sudden the trees get cut the swamp is still there the soil is there and the average depth is 8 ft things grow very nicely especially when we add phosphorus quite well aware of that so that's where we're kind of where we're at and I'm going to end it there I hope there's a thousand questions see me later or become a friend of mson Pawn and jump in on some of these things and you too will learn just exactly what's going on in the I just I just want to tell you that that's not my phospherous in the pond and I'll tell our our Growers and Bruce is on I wanted Bruce because Bruce will tell me when the St out of B yeah Farm Farmers have a right to farm yeah oh yeah I don't see that as of big a lot of the land use in that area has changed tremendously yeah and it's just the uh the Forester Randy Brandy legi said Steve it's Death By A Thousand Cuts and we're here to find 850 of them to just try to try to reduce the phosphorus yeah I don't I don't look at Farmers with a with a with a sad eye when it with us when we talk about the phosphorous in the F thank you thank you so Mr Foster is going to update you on the next step and I just want to um make it folks aware that we're going to ask for a vot later and new business to authorize the tan to accept funds on behalf of friends of mon PA for the EPA Grant which Mr Foster is going to speak about I believe I'm going to try yes sir thank you thank you um good evening I'm Dean Foster see you over there proud yeah proud resident of for Fairfield um so Steve really gave you a good Lowdown we been I I guess one of the comments I would make about the process that it is damn technical um there's a uh we are very very fortunate that the organizations that the stakeholders who are involved in this have a have a sincere interest in seeing us be successful the fact that we formed the 501c3 really indicated the seriousness that we have the group that we were able to get together Steve really did a lot of the work in putting together the uh group for the Watershed survey and for the plant survey um of which d nrcs uh were all in Lake Stewarts of main were all heavily involved the reason why we're here tonight is that um the second step of this process is we we've done we've done the Watershed survey the second step is to take that information and figure out what are the things that we need to do to do two things one is to determine exactly what the phosphorous levels are in the pond now and how they compare to what the phosphorous levels were back in 1976 the last time that DVP did a major uh study of the pond and um the the uh the the other part of that is it's not just Foster but it's also sediment and so to look figure out um where we're getting um undue amount of siment coming into the pawn boat landing would be a prime example of that and and uh so the planning Grant uh that we are applying for is actually the third grant that we've applied for and I just want you to know that we're two for two just in case you're wondering um uh and the first grant actually came a courtesy of John ELR um and so Steve and I through out we do dissolve o in testing and we have a $4,000 piece of equipment that John got through a safe water uh Grant process through the Utilities District so we're very fortunate and we also received a grant from Lake Stewarts of main to write the final report on the Watershed survey this one's a little bit more extensive as a 501c3 we're not we're not allowed to uh apply for the grant we cannot be the Grande it needs to be a quasa municipal entity Ergo the town of Fort field so we've talked with Tim the town of Fort Fairfield has the benefit of someone uh Tony who has the expertise in managing uh administering grants receiving a funds Distributing them writing the reports that uh Eda requires uh so Tony's had a lot of experience in that and we're very fortunate that he's going to be he's going to be helping us with this um so we we we've done the watered survey we're doing this planning Grant this planning Grant is probably going to be somewhere around $50,000 uh of which we're going to have a match of around 14,000 uh the the vast majority of that is in kind Labor uh there's probably going to be between ,500 to $2,000 worth of cash that we'll be putting in and that will be coming from friends and Lon pa um the only thing that we're asking from the town for Fairfield is to allow uh uh Tony to be able to do the the administra uh stuff which he was so good at and also Tim's involvement he is on our board but also his involvement as the town manager um and then the last part of this this this grant is I due in May um it will be uh the grants will be awarded in October we will be starting in January or February uh and it's probably going to be a two-year process and then after that we then start this process all over again to create an implement implementation Grant uh which will allow us to uh Implement uh the um the plans that are made through the planning Grant which is based upon the Water set survey that we've done so this is a five to six year process that we're in I don't know if Steve and I going to be around for five or six years but we're going to try um but we know you folks are going to be in um for cism wet is critical uh not just because of the um not just because of the requirements of being a CA by Municipal entity but just because of the fact that U the town recognizes the value in willing to participate in the process uh so that helps our Grant application a lot gives us a lot of credibility so obviously we are really pleased that you folks are willing to do this uh so we're looking forward to you voting affirmatively of allowing Tim to sign that allowing the town to be the grantee so that is where we are any questions at all or any of that go Inland that FAL for there that's not due to that new containing wall out there under the merch is it yeah partially due to the Decay I get the of the every year getting worse yeah yeah you're right it is and I just I just have aside since I've got the podium I just want to say that this is something that Matt has heard from me a number of times police officers can be enforcers and they can be Guardians you know that to have a police officer have the mentality of a guardian to look at all citizens in an equal manner it's a gift and what that lady had to say Daman brought tears my eyes because I think Matt does that in space and he certainties and asset to this community she was very articulate and and had a very um very I'm glad she took the time to share that I thought that was pretty cool thanks guys apprciate thank you thank you Mr Foster you know if I back in my television days I would have probably put the spring clean up next to arised Waste Solutions report but I did not stack my agenda properly so we'll move on to Spring Cleanup I just wanted to to spread the word that we will be holding spring cleanup event begins this year uh SC scaled down as it has been in the last couple of years uh cleanup week will be May 13 through 16 residents will need to bring their items to the sand shed on Chene Grove uh Public Works Crews will be there to accept V debris and painted wood and metal between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. and again any debris or trash left outside of those hours will considered littering so items that will be accepted include brush lawn debris unpainted wood old app and large metal items what will not be accepted no paint no stains no tires no furniture no glass no electronics or and no household waste uh hopefully at some point we'll look at our ability to do a curbside again in the future but uh right now we're going to reutilize those resources hopefully to to work on some other bled issues around town questions on the spring cleanup ples just want to make sure folks know that that was happening we get the word out there on that fantastic item G is the fiscal 2425 budget um so I I published and distributed the the first draft of the budget on March 22nd and I'll be honest I I've received a limited amount of feedback from um residents um which is not exactly what I had expected given uh the contentious budget processes the town has been through the past years though I'm very thankful because it does seem to me that folks understand the financial situation we're in uh they hope to have us work to fix it and and understanding the approach our department heads and and I have taken to work with on this year's budget um and I do appreciate the tenor of the discussions we've had and I I I do look forward to working through this process also look forward to June 13th the day after hopefully we ratify the budget um but we F two public meetings uh on this budget uh with the department heads on April 4th budget advisor committee the 10th uh the budet budget advisory committee's tely scheduled to hold a meeting again on the 8th of May uh the public hearing schedule is as follows first budget hearing on May 1st here in the council chambers the second budget hearing at the next regular Town council meeting on Wednesday May 15th and again the hope is that the budget will be voted on at the regular Town council meeting on June 12 so uh what is in the budget what is what is not so it's an interesting situation that we find ourselves in and um you know I told folks since I came on board that the town has you know is out of the operating room but probably not out of recovery and and that really holds true we still are carrying an outstanding amount of debt of about $1,800,000 uh and about $ 880,000 of that debt was occurred and again kind of for the creation of an ambulance service but in reality much of that Revenue was chewed up in salaries and other expenses that really we have very little to show for um in January of this year we were able to pay off the remaining $500,000 in tans that we had held over from several years before um and actually um we we are in a situation to actually go out and see proposals on tan starting next week and should have a much uh much improved rate despite the fact that there really hasn't been much change in what the FED is charging uh banks for money U but I do think it it is a reflection of the financial position that the town is in in the improvements that have been made over the past two years um one of the major drivers of this year's budget is the is the schools uh they're seeking uh to have a 19.8% increase in the local contribution uh bringing the town share of the local school budget to2 2.7 uh million um I do want to make sure folks are aware that the schools held the line for about five years in a row from 200 on uh really trying to help utilize covid funds to pay for their other expenses uh make some Capital Improvements the school uh I know you folks had heard from superintendent Staples as well um it's still a $450,000 increase though and and it is a a big um item to absorb um but it's something at this point in time I believe we're able to do in this budget uh another another major cost driver of this this year's budget is going to be the county uh rix's tax bill uh we known for a year or so that they were going to hit us with a six-month special tax bill which uh translated to $175,600 th000 last year for a year but when you multiply that by to you realize that that's a substantial increase of nearly $55,000 if extrapolated over a year um I'm hopeful that the new Cy's uh bill for the 10 will not be 350,000 but closer to 325,000 uh and that is what we have budgeted in this bill uh we are proposing to pay that full six-month special bill and the full County tax in this year's budget uh to get that off the books and help us move forward uh creating a more stabilized predictable bu forward um and then really the biggest change is and and it's really a mixed blessing that we received is revenue sharing um we were projected to receive about $1,300,000 this year I think we're at projected to be about a milon 80,000 and in 2425 that that looks to be about 2.2 million um certainly and I folks have heard me say this in the few meetings that we've already had related to the bud I'm going to keep harping on this it's an opportunity for us to hit reset but if we don't use it responsibly we are going to set ourselves in motion for a what what I would consider to be kind of a a mill rate yo-yo um because if we we're already looking at a reduction in Revenue sharing for next year in 25 26 because of our mill rate reduction this year with indexing and some other items that we're going to look at this year we could be looking at a substantially lower mill rate um but we also have to just make sure that that doesn't reduce Revenue sharing by so much that then we have to raise the mill rate again to to offset it um I really think that the the budget that we put forward represents a stabilized approach to managing and funding and operating government I believe it's fairly conservative um it doesn't add new Staffing in any department at all as a matter of fact I believe it's a net loss of one employee um you know but it does impact some some major areas uh a Capital Improvements plan that we put in place um you know it addresses a lot of our community needs does it fix everything no uh does it fix our our equipment needs it doesn't even begin to address those um but I do believe that this this budget is an opportunity for us to kind of hit reset and uh and start to move our community forward in a in a better way um clearly I could go through line by line should you guys want me to I don't really know what you want me to present on I just wanted to give some thoughts that I I had I I do um think some of the other highlights in this budget that I didn't touch upon in that memo are a vast Improvement or increase in what we would seek to spend on Paving um that is certainly one thing I have heard a lot this year is uh condition of Roads uh we would be looking to do $250,000 in that Paving line this year uh which would be about 100,000 $110,000 more than last year give us the opportunity do about 3.2 miles of Road uh it does not take us out of the current 39 year or 40-year Paving cycle uh but it does put us closer to a 20-year Paving cycle which is we really would like to be in a 15year uh cycle but if you think about it this way the second best Road in for Fairfield today would not be paid for 39 years uh so that would be the year 2073 um so we' got to look at what we're doing with our roads and and address it this is a step in the right direction um certainly uh we're looking at our insurances carefully other income sources carefully and uh and planning to just try to maintain our uh infrastructure and those infrastructure improvements are are across Municipal uh properties uh anybody that walked in through our front door today knows that those steps are are in sad shape and and are a liability um they're a fall Hazard we have another major fall hazard in our in our Public Works garage uh we have another walkway at the library so there's a lot of different pieces of the puzzle that we seek to address in this budget um happy to answer any questions you folks have I'm not sure if that's what you're looking for for a a budget address but um that's kind of it in a nutshell in terms of the high points that in and certainly inflation has made everything expensive um we were complaining about the cost of DS today I never thought I would be doing that but it's true questions concerns on the budget any any items that you want to address anything in there that stands out as any math errors questions comments you guys know how to track me down and I welcome citizens to get online take a look I just want to say I'm on board with you know not not you know yo-yo the uh rate keep the revenue sharing you know station yeah stabilize that yeah it's and it's going to be a dance and I and I think we will make for a mill rate reduction I don't think that there's any question there and I hope that we are able to do some relief for taxpayers um I think the key component is is weighing that in that in that not overly complex formula that the state uses which is population times assessment divided by evaluation where it's uh equals Revenue sharing but um I think we'll we'll be in touch with our state counterparts that certainly understand what those fluctuations would uh would entail but I think it's important that um we be very careful and mindful of that because it's easier to plan for something that you know rather than than kind of knee-jerk react to to those changes and I that is my biggest biggest budget concern is that we we create an unstable environment in which our residents and our taxpayers and our businesses just don't know what's coming on the pipe uh We've hit them with enough surprises here recently that I I you know the the it's a been a a very refreshing thing to hear from a lot of folks that you know we can we can tell to the line just don't hit us with another increase well that's nice to hear but we want to give relief but if we do how much is appropriate without turning around and hitting me with another increase my ultimate goal would be to try to Flat find somehow on the the tax line for the next two to three budget Cycles I think it's possible um but it's it's going to be a very careful dance and uh a lot of things are going to have to fall our way certainly um but the other piece of it is you know putting us back in a position to compete for Grants and have Capital to be able to go and leverage additional funding to help us with so um I'm very optimistic cautiously optimistic I believe is my motto um but I'm very optimistic that we have put ourselves in a position to turn yet another corner and move forward and and uh very much of that appreciation and thanks belongs to our department EDS who came in with very reasonable budgets this year and certainly uh we can never thank being boster enough for coming in and seriously stopping the that that um had our Tan on the bra yeah so any other questions or concerns comments certainly happy to to talk to anybody that has questions or concerns that you know how to reach me in the town office I'm here every day uh except foray so uh in in my budget presentation I did mention the June meeting date change and I going to continue to remind folks that the June Town council meeting has been moved to June 12 to avoid the conflict with the OBS certification of June so I just want to make sure that that is out there um it was an unintended conflict on the calendar and I want to make sure folks uh know when we're meeting next um that's all I have under correspondence and reports Mr chairman old business is yours sir okay uh on behalf of our C Council and uh and getting back to our spirit of America award that we table from our last meeting but uh it is uh all all five of us counselors have voted and uh Mike Greenlaw will be our recipient for our 2024 Fort Fairfield Spirit of America Foundation tribute award I'm the notaker too sorry yes slow slow process uh do you folks need to vote on that though I know you said you voted but I believe that should be done part of the record public okay should I have motion we put forward green the re of of America yeah motion second any questions all those in favor I thank you congratulations Mr greenw and thank thanks for your unwavering service of the town of Fort Barfield fantastic uh on to new business I'm going to slide in rig off the talk since it's fresh in our minds um I request that the council authorized the town of for Fairfield to accept an EPA planning Grant uh for planning uh on the water body known as bunson Pond uh the town would be the pass through on this uh friends of M paon would be responsible for any maning funds including uh being kind and whatnot U Mr LEC and I are are happy to assist with this project understanding the importance of Ms and pawn to the community so uh if someone so more all those in favor hi hi excellent I'm recording you guys' votes as we move along so next item up for bids under new business folks is the EMS stabilization Grant um so just a little background back in 2023 the state um passed into law budget that included a $31 million program to support Emergency Medical Services in the state he created a sustainability fund uh that grant program went live earlier this year with $12 million available uh to about 200 or more eligible EMS departments in the State uh Chief jar applied and with and the fort Fairfield Fire NS service was awarded 98,6 from the program uh the grant would provide funding to basically help us uh maintain and retain uh medical service providers EMTs paramedics uh bringing their salaries closer in line with peers through also reducing the overall operating cost of f in this department uh we certainly recognize that this is a a one-time Grant this year but we believe that there will be additional funds available uh and we hope this is something that the state continues to do because uh the cost of all services uh on the Fire EMS police um Public Works it doesn't matter what it is expensive so um we would recommend Council to approve uh Chief jar signing this contract with me Ems for the U main EMS stabilization program's questions um does this uh is this a reduction in the cost reflected in our budget yes yes it is okay I believe it dropped the overall operating line by over $25,000 yes sir uh though it may not be wouldn't be the one that I put online because we didn't have those this approval at that point I can provide you those updated members in the budget at that it's updated on my spreadsheet so I can send that up to you folks I I entertain a motion here to for chief jelbert to sign the contract with the main EMS awarding Grant the motion we follow the recommendation okay motion second okay any questions or discussions all those in favor I excellent and I will get you that updated I realize every time I make a change on my spreadsheet I will also send you guys uh the cash flow analysis as well which I didn't realize was part of the budget I've done two different well six different versions two different ones I'm willing to provide kind of obsessive about this cash flow thing but it drives our CA so much uh it just I don't know I guess it can't take the banker out of me right now um so uh we have a proclamation uh to um proclaimed the week of May 5th through May 11th as the 55th annual professional Municipal C clerk week throughout the T town of for Fairfield and

I been using that figure for an awful long time uh since 2122 and probably even before that so that's the figure that I work with I haven't overspent it in the last few years and I feel comfortable that that's what I can use I won't over spend it and then the Community Development line uh that used to be a much higher line years ago especially when we were doing more grants but it was been reduced to $2,100 the last 3 years two years and there was a year that there wasn't any budget and we still had to continue to do things and fortunately they put back in $1,500 for my expensive officials line so I can attend things in Augusta attend things in Portland and pay dues for the organizations of professional organizations that we the down for part of like the main Community Development Association in The Economic Development Council of Maine and any other agency like that and that's where that line comes from so that total line is $2,100 I don't have any funding in marketing development I used to have a line around $25,000 A year hav had in for several years since we got rid of the J of Commerce was removed and then I have one line only for uh revenues and that's for code enforcement fees and I always budget $5,000 for that if we exceed the $5,000 because they have an increase in fees collected for permits if the state fees go up on on the code enforcement expense side it's offset by the permits that we take in and a couple years ago I anticipated another solar farm going in thought we were going to get another $2,500 budgeted a little heavier I think we're only going to bring in around $5,000 this year unless there's some permanent actions going on and so far I do not have a new house permit that's where justification of my lines are do you have any idea of what you might looking for increase evaluation building perms demolition no way of I'm assuming there more building permits than demolitions okay I'm are there any questions we will not know what the mill rate is probably any earlier than August and we get done all of our summer work gather all the factors that we're going to have to do do the things that Mr Foster just suggested about permits we'll pick that up a summer work anything that's out there and hopefully we don't have any more demolitions or removals and we're hoping that there are a couple more projects in the wings that we going to pass some positive valuation changes still unknown till we get a work done any else Mr I have no further questions your honor anyone else I'm good fantastic thank you uh I going to quickly into the police department's presentation here and invite Chief coming to come forth start your slideshow for the beginning and just while you're saying hello to folks Chief I'm gonna quickly grab aen I have one right here if you need it follow questions we don't have answers to Pockets were empty uh excellent Chief just let me know when you want me to move the slide sir I will um so hi everybody I'm uh Matt Cummings the police chief if you don't know who I am yet um I figure you all do uh I'm I'll speak a bit on operations um why why we do things the way we do um just so everybody kind of has an understanding um not a lot of people know how the police department runs what what we have for Staffing and um just the general idea of how we do things uh you can switch slides um so so I posted some of our goals um and and smalltown policing is um it's like a fine art okay uh you know finding a happy medium of how to effectively um enforce the law um basically fight crime um really focus on the issues in the community um such as drugs uh mental health domestic violence victim crimes thefts burglaries things like that um I find that it all starts with Community oriented policing and having those relationships um with the people in our community um you're working together with our residents utilizing modern proactive policing methods to reduce crime drug use drug trafficking uh therefore increasing the quality of life uh for our residents and the youth in our community um implementing the Dare program in in Fort Fairfield schools and we're working closely right now with the school administ ministration and providing um the school board has a lot of interest in having a school resource officer uh they they had asked originally for a quote for a full-time police officer um fiscally it's it's a it's a large expense to to to have a police officer especially with especially with um the issues with labor right now and and how basically it's a wage war in public safety everybody's fighting for the same small pool of applicants and bringing benefits and wages up to try to entice people um so we're the the Dare uh the Dare program would would work in conjunction with the school resource officer if it would happen I propos to the school board a part-time uh school resource officer basically I would provide a or we would provide a full-time police officer uh three days a week one week two days the next week based on the that full-time officer's Patrol schedule and the school would um pay to backfill that officer's shift with a with a part-time officer and my goal is to have one part-time officer dedicated to to to have some continuity to they'll know what their schedule is they'll be able to to to backfill those shifts and I have some interest in that already if that does come to fruition so that would bring us um a wonderful plat form to work with our youth um to provide a sense of security to um parents students teachers knowing that we're working with the school to um basically improve uh quality of life a feeling of safety up there working with the kids trying to to tackle some of the issues that we have going up uh going on up there either at the elementary school and at the high school and it would be a combination of both um so uh one of the our other goals and we do this day in and day out uh working vigilantly to bring closure and a sense of justice to victims of domestic violence sexual abuse and traumatic or violent crime um building a relationship with our youth of trust in the police and engaging uh with the police in a positive manner conducting proactive enforcement of traffic laws to reduce collisions uh and M of vehicle fatalities due to impaired reckless driving Common Sense management accountability proper policies and procedures through accreditation standards um accreditation is uh is a program that is relatively new in Maine where we now have a Maine law enforcement accreditation program it's called em leap basically it's all policy and training based where the towns commit to providing um professional Police Services through proper management of policies proper management of employees properly training employees um not running a Fly by Night operation that we actually investing in doing things right um and that's what I'm committed to uh fiscal uh responsibility and to be a professional and competent representation of our municipal government because sometimes um the police department is the only interaction that the members of the public or people visiting Fort Fairfield have of our municipal government so I think that our performance is certainly a reflection on our community next Tim so the way we we staff our Police Department uh chief of police that's me obviously I work Patrol shifts I work the road I I respond to calls I'm on call from home um when we don't have a police officer out in the mornings um we have three full-time patrolmen they work 12-hour shifts I've got two officers that uh work um they alternate night shifts um we have one officer on the road at a time generally and I have one uh full-time officer who uh Works dayshift um he works a 12-h hour rotation so you know he one week he'd work Monday Tuesday have Wednesday Thursday off then cover the weekend shifts day shifts Friday Saturday Sunday and it alternates on the opposite week um he would be the officer that would would be the school resource officer during the week when he's working um so we we cover the road for 20 hours a day um we our officers are on call from 2 am to um 6:00 AM um the night shift covers Yan call from 2 am to 4 am and I cover the on call when I'm working during the week from 4:00 am to 6: am uh we have an officer assigned to Main Drug Enforcement Agency um the rotic district task force which is 100% reimbursed by the state and um he works uh drug cases in the area um basically like an undercover type assignment and uh he's uh he's done really well with that so far and it's proven um proven very worthy and very um helpful in our drug cases that we we work on the road next so we'll go through some of the call volume uh for the Last 5 Years 2019 I I I had a hard time getting an accurate number and I didn't get an accurate number because that is when the state police uh switched records Management systems and I wasn't able to get a full full number so if you look at the trends um I started in August of 2021 July end of July beginning of August in 2021 and basically 2020 we had very very limited Staffing um so the incidents were lower because we did not have much proactive police policing happening traffic stops um citizen contact citizen assists um they just weren't there and I can't include the numbers that the Sheriff's Office uh dealt with in Fort Fairfield during that time as when we were paying an overtime for a deputy to cover Fort Fairfield when we we didn't have coverage um in 2023 last year uh was extremely busy for officers we we put forth 209 criminal cases to the district attorney's office um so far this year I I ran the numbers uh yesterday and we're at 74 so far for this year since January um our calls for service are are are a bit down from last year so far this year um but the just the severity of them has has uh increased and allowing um more arrests I guess or or resulting in more arrests um you can go to the next one Tim so uh these are this is the budget um and you can go to the next one Tim you have the budget sheet I won't bore you with looking at that um the increases uh what I have for this year uh it's labor um as with every other department uh in the town and every other department in in the county and the state labor is driving um budgets a lot higher uh I added uh uh some more to our part-time line because we've been utilizing our part-time officers so much and that is going to include uh coverage for the the the festival as well um in the past we would Bill the potato Blossom Festival for coverage uh I think that's I I don't think that's um something we should be doing I think something that should be absorbed into our budget and um we provide the coverage that we need for the festival um for straight dances for the extra events that we have the fireworks the parade I have to have all the officers in during the parade to block traffic and participate in the parade um our dispatch went up a little bit $386 and uh we have entered into a five-year contract uh to um have working body cameras and in Cruiser cameras uh that has been a big issue for us over the last couple of years we have been kind of Fly by Night on our body cameras purchasing cheap cameras on Amazon they've been failing um they not they haven't been recording the batteries don't last they fall off the officer's uniforms if they're in an altercation um they they just they're not working properly they don't have uh they don't come with proper software to store the um the footage on um it's not evidence-based uh this new program is uh we actually uh are in the in in the process of getting all of the equipment installed and uh hopefully within the next couple weeks they'll they'll be up and running um and this has been in the works since January uh December or January um and it's just been a process to get everything going um the new uh cameras are installed in our Cruisers uh we used a local upfitter uh for that uh the company pays for the um the upfitting as part of our contract uh they don't charge us for the cloud storage they don't charge us for the evidence uh storage um it's it's a very uh userfriendly system that doesn't allow somebody to go in there and just delete a video or try to remove something um that they didn't want somebody to see uh it's all logged um it's just it's it's a very good uh very good upgrade from what we really didn't have yeah I'm looking at she us I don't see where the ceras are on oper uh so that would be in the miscellaneous uh line yeah 23 24 got 24 24 25 okay now you only get under it chopped off the last it chopped off let me go back to your budet yeah so that this was what I have see on Cru prisoner expense so that that would be the miscellaneous line you can see the th in the 23 24 budget and then it's there I I just I lost the other question too Matt is on your salary increases I'm assuming that you you not you're not showing a big increase in overtime because of use of part time right because it doesn't look like a huge increase it isn't uh um I my goal is to is to utilize part-time officers for those extra shifts or or those incidental um you know sick or vacation uh it's it's a huge savings as officers are okay with that uh the full I think they'd rather come in for overtime but uh you know it is what it is at this point um they they're I think they're paid a a fair healthy salary um and um you know the over time does come up when when it when it's available whether they're getting called out whether they have court um or they need to cover a shift when a part-timer isn't available um but it's are they doing much with the uh you know the stone garden yeah yeah uh so stone garden is a the the work Department of Homeland Security reimburses us to have an extra Patrol yeah so we we did quite a bit of stone garden uh January into February the money has uh dried up for right now I work I'm working with the border patrol to try to get more they they wrote an operation um that has to be approved by Mima uh and it's in mima's hands so we will hopefully be getting another good amount of money to to have extra patrols for stone garden yeah looks good um you can yeah uh so I went through some I pulled um obviously we're the we're the sixth biggest community in in arusa County um I pulled what the neighboring communities have for uh the it's listed by Town population budget total full-time uh 2023 call volume arrests and vacancies uh uh per Department I don't think mwasa has a vacancy at this time um since so uh you know press gule um you know obviously it's a service centered Community um you know triple the population uh but certainly uh more than triple the budget uh as to what we're uh running here uh Caribou um you know for Fort Fairfield having 209 arrests in 2023 uh 377 in Caribou isn't far from what we're doing over here uh if you're doing percentage of population there um so this just numbers for Thought uh just to kind of put things into perspective and what other municipalities are paying uh for Police Service uh currently Washburn uh they have three vacancies they they don't have anybody working uh because they can't fill um they can't fill the positions they just can't find people uh Ashland uh they're almost in the same boat and the sheriff's office has picked up the slot with no extra coverage and they are running and from call to call to call from one end of the county to the other and um they have no time for proactive policing and it's reactive reactive reactive um you know with a police department right here in our community we can work the cases we can make a difference in in in crime and uh those are just numbers to just kind of put things into perspective there you can go to the next slide too uh so uh wages and benefits like we spoke about uh we're subject to a bargaining unit agreement our our full-time officers are uh 3% cost of living increase which is contracted our contract uh ends in uh 2025 so next next sometime in the beginning of 2025 we'll we'll be uh entering into negotiations with the patrolman um we have one longevity step uh for officers our pay scale goes by um years of service for um longevity when they get to certain steps they they receive an increase um wages and benefits need to remain competitive uh with other agencies to retain staff and we're the one of the only uh fully staff police departments in arusa County right now and I think that that speaks volumes of our community and how our community supports uh law enforcement and um I that's really important for us to be able to do our job is to have the community support and we really have it here in Fort Fairfield and we're really grateful for that and I've worked all over the county as a as a deputy sheriff and Fort Fairfield in my opinion is second to none in support of law enforcement it always has been uh we spoke about the camera program um so we can go to the next slide so some of the cost-saving measures that uh we use a bulletproof Fest Grant uh the federal government uh will will fund 50% of a bulletproof Fest for an officer which those are close to $1,000 a piece they last about five years so we're good for a little while on that unless we hire somebody new then we need to provide them a vest uh we're using the herald Alpha on Workforce initiative and they will pay 50% uh cost tuition match for any training that we send a police officer to uh which has been really helpful with our our training budget they they'll pay up to $1,200 per officer per year and we're taking advantage of that um training is important for for uh professional and personal development for our police officers and it it it presents a more competent knowledgeable police officer out there on the street which obviously reduces um risk and risk of lawsuits for our community uh we get the burn Jag Grant which is a small equipment Grant I bought a prisoner uh partition with our burn drag Jag Grant this year which was about $1,300 uh the Walmart Foundation uh Grant I used the uh Walmart Foundation grant that we got this year it was $2600 uh we had to equip our uh police cars within car printers uh the reason for that is the Attorney General's office or the legislature has directed the Attorney General's office uh to have law enforcement agencies document um certain information for people that we encounter on the road for traffic stops uh we need to uh log um what the officer perceived race of the individual was what the officer perceived the gender of the uh individual was and what the officer perceived uh theth ethnic origin of the individual that we stop are so now we're pro we're required to provide uh quarterly reports to the Attorney General's office on that data to reduce um any instances of suspected profiling U by police so we worked with our the company and the in the county who uh does our records management to try to get some sort of algorithm in our incident cards that would be able to log that information for us and generate a report uh Motorola wasn't able to come up with something um practical for it so now we've had to um we've had to switch to ew warning and and E citation so ew warning and E citation uh every time we stop a vehicle we have to pull it up on our laptop the program has those boxes for the data that we have to collect on traffic stops and will automatically generate that report and send it into the Attorney General's office for us so it's a new basically unfunded mandate and requirement and that we have to comply with by July 1 uh and fortunately we had the Walmart uh grant that was able to cover the cost of the the three printers that we needed um leeso equipment program uh we haven't taken advantage of that in previous in in the last couple of years and that uh is the federal government military surplus program they used to call drmo um in the past we've been able to procure equipment for Public Works U Darren and I have been trying to find uh some equipment uh to help them with their operations and our mission uh which you know their operations C uh critical to our mission uh we haven't had much luck lately but we that's available to us uh Surplus equipment from outside agencies when available um we we've been donated equipment from the Sheriff's Office the state police uh which we've been use we've been able to use to trade for equipment that we've needed or uh labor for um installs that we've had to do with autotronics and things like that uh using part-time officers to fill vacancies in Le of overtime uh Public Works performing vehicle maintenance when available uh using our own staff for light repairs and vehicles around the station uh that when I say that repairs I'm talking like police equipment repairs not not mechanic work um signed vehicle program uh which we we do here here in Fort Fairfield it reduces vehicle maintenance budget greater accountability for our equipment recruitment retention benefits uh and it's comparable to our competitive agencies uh we shop different vendors uh for pricing and we utilize the uh the state funded MDA task force agent next Tim so some of our Capital Improvement needs that we're not going to see or not be able to uh uh absorb into this budget but just an overall quite minuscule compared to issues in other uh departments um taser replacement our current uh tasers that we're using uh were purchased in 2016 some of them were actually purchased by housing at that time um they have a five-year shelf life uh we're beyond that so in the next couple of years we really need to think of all electronic devices have shelf lifes uh three-year uh police cruiser uh replacement rotation um like to continue with a three-year uh rotation for replacing a police cruiser uh police station Access Control building wine interior and exterior camera system uh we recently uh experienced a failure in our our um camera system that was installed when the when the building was was put together and the police station was built uh that failed last summer uh we at the beginning of the fiscal year purch purchased a system on Amazon with an external hard drive uh the the hard drive on that thing failed already I had reboot put a a new hard drive in it um It's seems to be working but when we try to uh record a video or export a video the system shuts off and restarts so it's not it's not reliable um we would need a more reliable system at some point especially when we're doing interviews interrogations and things like that so for now we'll rely on our body cameras for that uh carpet replacement um we just at some point we have three rooms in there we need to pull the carpet up and just put either a floating floor or a rubber vinyl flooring um garage door uh the the garage door the man door on the side here needs to be replaced uh it has some issues so um I put reserves maybe fulfill with savings from this budget year but I think we have some workers comp issues that are probably to need to be addressed uh with uh any savings that we would have from our budget this year so go ahead Tim and that would be all I have and I'd be happy to entertain anybody with any questions good work Chief thank you good thanks guys I appreciate the recognition of my workers stomp issues slide on that later yeah uh I am always available to answer questions so if anybody has anything you can always email me call me stop by the station um I'm happy to I'm happy to clarify anything for anybody excellent next up to bet keep the chief rolling it's Chief to Chief to Chief got an animation in it I'm I apologize yes just got to click all right good made me nervous I'm sorry um all right good even good evening everybody um I first wanted to start out just by kind of explaining you know our staffing levels as well too so our department now has has grown a little bit um we've got 35 members um it consists of three crews and for full-time staff we have myself I cover daytime hours and I'm on call like Matt 247 um of those three crews we have two people on uh 247 to staff the ambulance um so that equals out the seven fulltime firefighter EMTs and of the other 35 28 of them are are part-timers the vol uner firemen and EMTs so any given time there's during the day there's three of us and you know nighttime hours there's still always two unless they're on a call go ahead and click so our calls for service for 2023 we had a total of 740 calls and that breaks down to 119 fire and 621 EMS um this year we're right on the same Trend uh um that uh we're still looking between 6 and 650 for EMS calls and the 119 fire calls has been averaged the last five years um one thing I wanted to point out is in 2023 during the hours of 6: AM and 6: PM during the week we had 53 fire calls um and 35 of those calls were actually handled by the full-time staff with no response from the part-time volun staff because there was nobody available that's that's one one thing during the day for the crew when they need backup for a assist or we have a structure fire it's just us three until we receive Mutual Aid um I just want to you know stress the importance of those those two members that are here 247 each each shift they're not covering just EMS so if we get a car fire we get a structure fire any any fire related call that we run on they they fill the gap for for the volunteer part-time staff so Mike um you're you're the folks that you have on EMS are also qualified firefighters firefighter one firefighter two so so the there's like we we just uh had a few people leave and we've got new new Personnel on um they they're some of them are already trained and some of them are in the process but they willing to do that y y so they dual R yeah so the issue you're talking about is not you need to for no no no it's it's Nationwide it's it's not even unique to the state it's Nationwide the the volunteer I I call it part-time now because we do pay them so what they volunteer is their their availability and and Nationwide volunteer departments are a Dying Breed because of full-time employment and like our case here is there's not as many full-time jobs in Fort so most of our people actually work outside of town whereas it's an unended benefit by having fire ESS together yep because right now in a community that is not the case and that that creates issues yeah because you don't have that when they have a fire call EMS is not necessarily because they're not fire right which is why we're we're unique where we're we're doing both roles right yep right I think it's a benef thank you Dan um one other tidbit of information that I wanted to wanted to throw there where we were talking about calls for service uh in 2023 we had three CPR saves and thanks to the police department and our good working relationship they've been involved in uh two of those for 2023 and we had three CPR saves which is it's a big deal because it it requires quick response time U quick activation of CPR whether it's bystander CPR or or us finally getting there to do CPR early defibrillation and early ALS care and quick to the hospital so because we have that ambulance in town um that we actually had three people that we saved from with CPR okay go ahead Tim as I said before with the with the trends that we have on the EMS side where we're in about the same uh same averages per month we got a slight increase on the fire stuff um one thing that I and I'll get to that in the next slide but uh one thing that I was looking at what I suggested is to do a slight increase on our part-time wages um which will help with a little bit of flexibility U one of the things it can do is it can it can allow me to bring in a crew for a local transfer right now that's one thing that we when we do a local transfer we most likely have to do overtime because our part-time people work our full-time em or part-time EMTs work for other services full-time so we'd have to pretty much bring our own guys in for overtime or a few volunteers um it also would allow us to provide coverage without paying overtime for sick time and vacation time and same thing for coverage for education and if you click one more time Tim uh right now I am doing most of the coverage for vacation sick time and education so we have we have two guys two people right now that are going to school as a to be paramedics they finally graduate in May so whenever they're in school I'm on the rig taking their place which pulls me out of the office to take care of other things but by increasing that that line a little bit it'll allow us to to have a little more flexibility to utilize part-time people more and give me a little bit of time to do what I need to do and and honestly I think I've only had two people take vacation the last year and a half that I've been here because of coverage and as Dan mentioned earlier you know that we we all of our guys are pretty much dual rooll so those that aren't full-time uh the volunteers they we do a lot of the training in-house so it's there's some on the job training and the same thing for we bring on an EMT that has no fired training we can do a lot of that training inhouse whereas the EMS side we have to go to nmcc for the for the accreditation but so on the fire side we're doing a lot of the stuff in house with by partnering with Maine fire Service Institute which they're part of Southern main Community College so these guys will actually receive college credit for their fire one and two when they complete I have a question so the the two employees that are attending nmcc is the town paying that education so um one the town is paying for one of them for their education the other one's paying their their own way yeah there was a contract signed years back for that one that one employee y so they have a commitment on on uh y yep I did throw a little breakdown of the call volume on the bottom here for fire calls just to kind of if anybody was interested in what type of fire calls that I was talking about so for 2023 there was 24 structure fires um I can't see that from here I'm sorry 18 rescue and EMS calls those were like uh would be a kid stuck on a swing and we had to cut the swing out or something or or um assisting you know providing a driver for the crew if there was two EMTs were needed in the back then a fireman would would jump in to the front has Hazmat calls there was 12 service calls are like smoke alarms or False Alarm kind of calls good intent calls or you know somebody says their cat stuck up in a tree or you know their smoke and it ends up being you know a false smoke thing um and again the severe weather stuff you know so you can see 119 it's not not a large call volume but but it's it's it's fair L large for for our town and most of those calls like I said there was 53 that that came out during during the daytime hours out of 909 so almost half of them happened during the day y sorry goe so one thing that I've been waiting to inform you guys on I had put in for the EMS stabilization Grant and it's been quite the process um we finally received the cont contract from Department of Public Safety and Mania Mass um in the tune of $98,000 and what that will allow us to do is to help with our Recruitment and Retention um by adjusting wages uh to be able to be comparable with the surrounding communities so we can retain our employees and and Recruit new employees when we when we need to and the the best part about this is this 98,000 actually takes the burden off the taxpayers for it'll cover the increases um that I proposing and then some so it'll bring my bottom line down even more so Mike is that that's only for one year though you don't know if you get that every year so that's the thing is is initially when this was proposed through the legislature they were looking it was suggested to them to fund it for five years to take that five years for them to kind of find out a a long-term solution and they the legislature approved it to fund it one year so far so it's going to be a year-by-year thing right now they out of don't quote me on the numbers but I believe there was 252 transporting EMS services in the state and as of last Thursday there was a 100 services that have not put in for the money so right now there's 21 or $19 million set aside for the sustainability for Recruitment and Retention and 100 departments have not put in for it at this point wow so there's a possibility that that rollover will actually go towards next year plus there's another $12 million that MMS has received with a for a total of 31 million that they don't even know what they're going to do with yet um so there might be more monies out there for for this fiscal year whether it's equipment or some more recruitment and retention or things like that so there's still Millions out there that they haven't counted accounted for that'll probably work to your favor too your foot in the door y i I also think it's important to keep in mind that by being able to take advantage of this m have a better job of being able to recruit and maintain whole staff and the better able he is to do that the more able he's going to be to go out and possibly look at providing services to other communities which then would bring money into Fort Fair have help subsidize the service for the citizens of for faf so the mik can't do that until he has a well-trained full staff and uh so this 98,000 may help put him over the home and that he may not get full 98,000 next year but he may be getting 50,000 from some other community that he's providing service through that would help offset not getting that for next year I mean I think it's a really positive thing M I think it's positive I'm I'm involved in a couple of other boards and what we were what we're concerned about is that you're you're now changing permanently changing the pay scale correct and what we opted to do in our operations was to give those out of the bonuses so they did get the money this year but it wasn't in our it's not necessarily stuck to our budget for the following right so it's just another idea yep so put it up yeah definitely I think you had did you have something too or I was just curious the staff that you do have how many of them are the do we have staff that's been there for a long time or you we have staff in training currently I'm just curious to find out whether or not I know like police departments across the state are having problems where police departments are being use incubators for for career climbing so you you pay for their training you you build them up and then they all move on to the next SC so so our full-time staff um we have we have a mixture of different levels for for the EMS there's the EMT advanced CMT and then paramedic and on the fire side there's firefighter one and firefighter 2 so with our full-time staff all uh so six out of the seven are all fully fire trained and as far as EMS side um all but one are have an EMS main State EMS license yeah and some people only one person has taken advantage of of the the EMS education as far as the fire stuff it costs the town nothing because we we do it all in house and partner with main fire service it's not as expensive as the PD they the academy down there is pretty pretty expensive but don't know if that answered your question or not I guess for the most part like have have our employees been with us five years 20 years um with the town of Fort Fairfield uh the full-time people let's see four of them have been here from the start of the ambulance service years two two to three years yeah yeah two people are are are new to the department had some attrition already yeah yeah so some of the goals we have that you know I'm going to continue to to seek uh out grant funding I've already again this year applied for the assistance to firefighter Grant through FEMA um last year we got shot down for the the engine uh only because they ran out of funds so the positive note about that is that that we made it to the very end when they ran out of funds so that means that our grant was good and we qualified but we just didn't get high enough in the priority line so this year um if you don't succeed the first time try and try again right so we're being patient with that and and going to continue to to to seek out funding for that um Dan kind of hit on this a little early for me and but we want to explore the feasibility on increasing our coverage area you know we have some surrounding communities uh eastn Limestone and working on our mutual Aid agreements with the surrounding communities that we do have a potential um the biggest reason that we haven't pushed forward on that yet is because it does cost to get bigger and we're not there yet we still have one opening and by fixing the the the wages and getting that recruitment retention money it puts us in a better place to once we're full um we and we can prove that we can take care of our Citizens first then we can start planning head to to to reach out because there are per capita um charges that we can bring in for Revenue along with the billing for those calls so that's one of the goals for the future once we get our all our slots full and and and we want to do it right in a in a timely manner that I I don't think this year we were ready to to do anything like that but I think we can be in the future so Mike you said you've got two that are that are going to be graduating in May yep is that for intermediate or for paramedic that's two for paramedic seriously yep yep because right now we have one paramedic and one Advanced so they're considered ALS everybody else is basic we can actually charge more for an for a paramedic call than we can for a basic call three paramedics so we'll have three paramedics and I still have that one opening that I pretty sure I can get filled here shortly with a with another paramedic so we'll potentially have four paramedics that be great y um been working on one of our goals is to increase our revenue and one one way that we can do that right now there's been a little bit of change in the legislature they're putting a little bit of pressure um on insurance companies for EMS that typically in the past when we somebody calls an ambulance and they decide H you know I guess I don't need an ambulance I'm gonna I'm gonna take myself or my my son's Gonna Take Me Over uh they sign the appropriate documents for us to to release them and they take themselves and we recruit nothing from that so what happens is we we do bill for it we bill um a flat rate of $100 to the patient and most of the time we we don't get we don't receive the the the money for the bill so the we're working with the insurance company and our billing company that now with that mandate um we're able to build the insurance company direct so I've done it a couple times just to just to fail out the insurance companies and I haven't had one kick back so all of our sign offs if the person has Insurance we're we're they'll give us their insurance information we build the insurance and they might pay 75% but it's that's more than what we're getting by billing the patient directly um one thing that I'm we're also working on is to bring back our Junior firefighter EMT program uh that that's where we start getting people hooked at a young age um I started in the fire service at 18 years old and I'm here now you know there's we've had quite a few people that we've recruited from the high school through a junior fire program that they've made careers out of it now so we'd like to get back into the schools um maybe help out with a healthare or something or or or even the career exploration program that they've got going on now at the the middle high school so we're going to look at at getting into the schools more often and I I'm actually in the process right now of working with me man Ms with a junior EMT program so before this year if you were under the age of 18 you could not hold a MMS license as a as an AMT um being a minor this year they're allowing a 16-year-old as somebody as young as a 16y old to hold a main EMS license if they've passed the EMT basic class at the college as long as there's a department with work working with mems to come up with a an actual program so it's kind of a study you know pilot program that they're doing and so we're working with them to to work with that program to get it going this summer and it's too bad Chuck's not here tonight his daughter is actually enrolled in the EMT program and we're hoping that she'll be our pilot uh junior EMT at some point and another thing that we'd like to do is is do a little more community outreach um most of our guys had a blast when we did the community breakfast and it was amazing where it had two weeks of notice U and we had we we had fed over 200 people we don't necessarily want to do a fundraiser every time but but at least have a an event for the community more than just the fire prevention month in October to to do more things with the community we're we're just to be on you know to get a little info out there soon we're looking to bring back the mashed potato wrestling for the festival the fire department is so you know we're just trying to get up in the community a little bit more as well we also try to money to make Chief jail Chief but I'm not saying that publicly either he fights dirty his taser is old so you'll be all right go ahead so there there has been some Savings in my in my budget that I've put together uh one one place was under uniforms we've got quite the Surplus stock of uniforms now now um so we really have been able to knock that down a little bit dues and Subs subscriptions there was quite a few needless sub subscriptions in there that we we we don't need to renew um so we're able to save a little bit there the training we're doing a lot in-house we one of our new employees is a instructor coordinator uh so we can teach EMS trainings and one of our full-time firefighters is a main fire service in structor as well and I've got uh a few years practice with main fire service on putting on fire one and two Academy so we can save a little bit there by doing a lot of In-House stuff uh meals I brought my meal line down a little bit because honestly I think I've spent like 25 bucks because every time we've had a major incident people have been begging to take care of our food we had that major structure fire fire on Riverside da and there was three people trying to take care of the breakfast sandwiches and and R&J is like no I'm trying to do something for the guys leave me you know I got this you know so you know that's thanks to the community there you know but it but it is a savings uh maintenance again a lot more in-house I've rebuilt thing or two with these trucks that we have I've got a lot of experience with these I've done the rebuilt some Valves and the pumps many many times over so we're able to save some some money fuel we've eliminated a lot of waste um we have a few less Vehicles now so that helps as well hose replacement we have so much new hose that I don't need to put in for any hose this year so I've removed that line for the year at some point we might need to revisit it but for at least for the time being we we there's no need for hose replace replacement and EMS supplies and I got to tell you I I've been able to reduce that line again this year I reduced it last year and I'm able to reduce it again and that's all due to the credit of my staff they have been very good with it they they they eliminate waste by you know if we need if we're going to use 10 in a year they're not going to order a 100 so they they they keep track of that so I want to say it was a you know eight five to 8,000 reduction from even from last year so and that's on the employees there are few increases um wages and benefits but again we've talked about that EMS sustainability grant that covers that and then some uh turnout gear so as most of you remember when I started a year and a half ago we were pretty much down to two volunteer firemen and now we have I think it was 20 28 so all that spare gear that we had is is gone and we actually have maybe five sets that are actually non-compliant but those gears that those sets of gears are able to be used with people that are in transition on on with training so until their interior tax certified they we can get away with them using that gear so I did up the the line item on turnout gear those go for about 3500 bucks a set and that's just jacket pants and yeah jacket pants and gloves that's not helmet and boots and which we have plenty of of the other stuff and vehicle maintenance I think I brought it up a little bit just because we have that that one used ambulance and our engines are 20 plus years you know 20 years this year old and they're they're they're taking a little work so but uh overall with the the savings that we found and the re projected Revenue that we've got coming in and that EMS sustainability Grant we're we're looking at a savings over last year to the taxpayers okay Tim so as a summary um just like we had said I'm looking at taking care of Fort Fairfield first before we start looking at um reaching out to other communities I think I think we're close with that um the wage adjustment actually makes makes that a little bit more possible to start reaching out it takes time to find some of the waste in the budget I've had a year and a half now it was hard to come up with a budget looking at some of these line items and saying okay well we're going to cut it in half well sometimes you can do that and sometimes even half isn't enough you could take more out of it so it's been taking some time to Trend what the actual costs are compared to what we were paying before so you know I appreciate you guys letting me take the time to to find some of that and each year we're we're finding a you know some more of it and I like I hit on before we're we're taking care of a lot of the work uh in house what we can't take care of we actually reach out to Darren him and his crew have been amazing they can take care of a lot of that stuff too I think we've had to take uh one vehicle over to whiteed Ford one time and that was it we've been able to take care of it either in house or at the highway department and again all the savings that we've been able to find has pretty much offset any of the increases that I've made this year K to so one number that I wanted to point out so our total budget this year um it with the increase I it's just a little over a million dollars okay that's a pretty big number we projected that we can bring in 325,000 on ambulance billing and 98,000 on uh the sustainab EMS sustainability Grant which brings that million down to 618,000 to the taxpayers that's what the taxpayers will be funding last year we were $899 I believe for fire and EMS and one thing that I wanted to point out is that number of 54,9 30,000 um if we were to have prescale come in and take over the ambulance it would cost a little over 250,000 for the per capita plus the revenue loss that we would not be receiving because they'll be getting it that totals that 500 $40,000 so you subtract it to what it cost the taxpayers is $74,000 well the EMS coverage from presca would not include fire department coverage whatsoever during the day you so that 74,000 you can't run a fire department even volunteer for $774,000 a year so I just wanted to show that to you guys to to kind of point out that that it's a lot more affordable than than it has been in the past and and that we're getting there and by reaching out to other communities at some point we we'll be able to get that window even smaller so the revenue the revenues are starting to come in for the EMS so that's a so we're averaging about 25,000 a month oh well yeah yeah good it been consistent for the last year and a half yeah yeah yeah and by doing a little bit more having that higher um the little extra part-time wages we might be able to pick up more transfers local transfers um which would again increase more Revenue so a local transfer we'll say is like from carry ER to Fort Ken or carry to Holton uh those we charge 1350 per mile loaded Mile and depending on if it's ALS if it's a paramedic that has to be in the back you're talking $1,000 on top of the mileage and if it's a basic call it would be like 700 plus the mileage so we we can increase our Revenue a bit more if we're able to actually take some of those those transfers has anyone ever quantifi cost taxpayers uh the cost savings to taxpayers having a fulltime fire department home so I I don't believe there's ever been any numbers looked at through that so I just to kind of give you a rough idea of what what what the difference would be is is the iso rating um so right now in town I believe it's a five mile radius in town which would be the hydrant District uh our ISO rating for fire insurance is a five which is pretty decent if that if we were all volunteered probably be a seven or an eight so it's a pretty big jump outside of that hydrant district with our full-time employees plus our volunteer employees we're we're 10 which is horrible it's the lowest you can you can get and that's just because of of response time and the amount of water supply that we have and because we're double Township and and it's and it's no different than you know than kibou and Pascal outside their hydrant District they're the same thing they tens as well so it's not that we're doing a horrible job but what what the big change between having full-time it's a lot of ground to cover so what the big change would be if we went from you know not having that full-time coverage to all volunteer sometimes no coverage during the day with volunteers it would bring your five in town to a 10 and it would it' be substantial especially with the businesses um it'd be pretty expensive to carry homeowners insurance but I don't have an actual figure no that's fine it's substantial difference in insurance any additional questions for chief well pardon my pun but don't burn yourself out you're doing you're doing a good job well thank you yeah thank you I do want to point out one one item on the the budget itself so last year and and I I did explain this to Dan and I've explained it to a few folks the goal was to try to split fire s to try to determine the cost of each department individually and it and it really led to a nightmare scenario for our bookkeeping where we were getting duplicate costs and so part of what you see in this when you look at this budget sheet that you FKS have here and I can turn the lights on if you like you have an EMS line and a fire line under the 2324 budget and then a 2023 24 estimate next to it I just want to point out that those those cost are combined again because we can extrapolate those costs and make an estimate easier than we can have our bookkeeper split somebody in half when we make a power call versus an EMS call so uh you know like if on the phone line you know where it looks like it's $10,000 versus you know 5,000 last year it's actually it was budgeted 5,000 prus 5,000 for fire for 10,000 mine I just thought that would be important to point out we we really really struggled with separating this out um I know it's not optimal I see Dan Stow because it it it really it really it really made for a very difficult situation listen I appreciate what you're talking about the problem that we had was is that there were a lot of citizens were looking at a $1.6 million budget oh yeah and we're wan to know exactly how much was ambulance going to cost and so if we're going to maintain a we needed to be able to separate the Fire cost out of that so people get a true picture exactly what that cost in relation to R and that was the purpose of all that I really didn't care about the bookkeeping quite frankly yeah because of the way it got put in in the budget it made it yes very difficult so I just I just wanted to point that out if anybody was kind of looking at some of those line items I'm wondering why this column looks like it's more than it's really those two combined that you need to compare to anyway just something I had noticed in there and and I I realized I hadn't explained why we had Rec combine those really is difficult to have one without the other and chief jar has done a great job of trying to explain some why that is I'll tell you the the big reason to keep them together too is um with other departments that that have their own EMS other fire when when it's just EMS overtime starts after 40 hours fire departments are the one depart uh one business so to speak out there that's exempt uh overtime starts at 53 hours so it saves on overtime because the overtime doesn't start until after 53 hours can't give away all our secrets try to start a fire [Laughter] department yeah right excellent any other questions like I I just wanted to point that out if there were any questions why that had been recombined we really it became a bookkeeping that year and we were actually seeing a lot of errors in the PS thank you Chief J thank you guys you thank you uh anybody want to stand up stretch the legs take a pee uh we're a few minutes ahead of schedule librarian I'm gon just load in the their slideshow but there's still plenty of pizza left too yeah there you go and I will get this queed up for l EXC yes we making out outside there sh right hanging in there y well they really can't he says he's moving to South Dakota to got a whole to our presentations online I'm apologize in advance for all of the slides oh yeah no worries you just tell me next slide next slide or I'll just keep hitting them so but uh Lynn's one of our uh threesome of librarians running the library and uh L take it away with your presentation okay you can switch to the first slide sure so just in case not all of you know us um the librarians um I'm Lin Cody um the one in the middle is Barb Alexander and then the one on the right is Robin gagman um and I'm the library director Barb is the circulation um specialist and Robin does programming and the rest of the list is just some of the other things that we have to do to kind of like our Specialties um you can switch so um pretty sure that nobody ever sat here and asked for a smaller budget so we're asking for a little bit more this year um and this is probably the only dollar figure slide I'm going to show you but just to get an idea of what we're asking for um if you look at the Top Line uh that's 2021 and the bottom line 2024 25 um so the increase that we're asking for this year puts us roughly back to the budget we had three years ago can change it so in November of 2022 we lost our full-time department head and at that time there was a lot of worry and a lot of questions about what was going to happen to the library um in 2023 our budget was cut in half and there was even more worry about that um so I'm going to call this chapter of the library called what the heck are we going to do now um you can change it um so we were lucky that we were able to enhance our budget with um grants and donations and fundraising so I I just want to show you some of the things that we did with those donations and grants um the first one was um in 2022 um before Barb and I took over we had gotten a donation from the Sha family um that hadn't been used yet so um with the goal of doing art shows more Community groups and more events and workshops we started there um you can switch we started by painting and making it a more bright a brighter and more cheerful color you can switch it again we added um better lighting um that would work better with the artwork and it's also more energy efficient um we added the windows and the heat pump to make it more energy efficient as well and we added picture rails for the artwork and we commissioned some signs that indicated that it's the shock community room um we've had um we've done a little over 12 to 15 artist shows since then and people really seem to look forward to them uh they're always commenting on how much better the room looks and um we've also been lucky enough to have some artists come back to do some programs and workshops for people next um we applied for an ala Grant and were awarded about $10,000 um the goal of that was to make rural libraries more accessible to seniors and people with disabilities um so we had had an ongoing problem with our a automatic door opener so we started by fixing that and then we wanted to make uh a really cozy spot down in the in the community room for people with mobility issues and people who have a hard time getting upstairs um don't have to be disabled to use the space but um we just wanted to make sure we had a comfortable spot for everyone um the next EX in Opportunity was a collaboration between the austic Agency on Aging and um the town of Fort Fairfield to create an access point um the purpose of that program is so that seniors can access services without having to travel so um for example if they have a doctor's appointment in Bangor or Portland they can tell a health with their doctor um and they're even going to be setting up things like yoga for senior classes that um if the if the instructor is in Ashland um they can use the tele conference equipment to participate in Fort Fairfield if somebody here wanted to do that and you can go ahead and switch it one more thing before we get out of the basement we cleaned a a room that was pretty um much a catch-all space for everything else we didn't know what to do with and we made it into a meeting room um that's for people who might want to do remote work or if they need a more private space than a community room can provide or if the community room is booked up um they can have this as an extra space um so all of those changes aren't just about making the library prettier um I think it's important to have an inviting and comfortable space people come to the library to fulfill a need um they need a book or a photocopy uh they need to use a computer once they get what they need whether they come back depends on the atmosphere um and if they got what they need so these are just some of the things that we do um you can go ahead switch it I think in order for the library to grow we need to provide things things that create interest um and one of the big ways we can do that is to create programs um we that was one of the things that we started talking about early on um Barb and I and we started by reintroducing Story Time with the help of volunteers um we did one artist reception per month and we did one event or Workshop per month um you can switch it um so that was in addition into all the other things that we have to do on a daily basis and this is some of those things um in that um this fiscal year we knew our budget wasn't going to cover a cover hiring a third person but we were getting so much interest in our programs and trying to do more um that it was almost getting impossible to schedule everything so Barb and I split our hours um to hire Robin and her objective is to concentrate on planning and implementing programs for both children and adults um this situation has pros and cons um some of the pros are that we've been able to provide 14 more programs this year so far um and the year it's not over and we've had 274 more participants this year um and I actually think these numbers are from February when we had the budget um um committee walk through so it's probably even more than that now um and both children and adults are asking for more programs so to me that says we're doing something right there's only one drawback there's no time to read but I'm I'm just kidding um you can you can go next um the drawback is that we have only 16 hours each to accomplish all of the goals and our daily tasks um so even though it was our choice to split up our hours and so we could have three people um it it's a little difficult to get everything that we need to do done in that amount of time so we spend a lot of our off hours um thinking about and doing things for the library um and and the beginning that was all right um because we kind of had two choices we could go with a status quo and keep things the way they were just just do enough to keep the library open um but we weren't really content to do that um because we knew it could be we knew it could be better um so along with volunteering some of our hours and doing fundraising and writing grants and hiring a third person who was willing to be a team player um I think we've gotten a really a lot done but I think that we've reached the point that um it'd be a benefit for the library to open one more day um maybe a small wage increase to um match the kind of work that we're doing and have a few more hours so that we can get more done on the clock instead of taking so many of our hours um on our off time um and just in case you didn't think we were doing enough you can switch the some of our upcoming plans are a couple of gardens the first one is an educational Garden um this one is funded by John Foster in memory of his wife uh his late wife Beth Fifer um it's going to be a teaching Garden we're going to um have programs revolving around teaching kids how to garden um being good good stewards of the environment um there's all kinds of programs we can do um and that project is going to be funded for the for um excuse me for seeable future does anybody mind if I grab a drink M so [Music] dry Ah that's better um you can switch it Tim just I love your art oh does these drawings they're just so oh wow they're like right out of a story book give give you a chance to catch your breath ah yeah thanks um one more Garden we're working on is going to be on the Elm Street side of the building um this idea came about when unfortunately we lost our colleague Rose Elmer um in that in November um we wanted a way to honor her um but we also wanted to invite the community um to be part of the space so um we're going to have a a corner for Rose and then in the rest of the garden the community can either buy a plant or a bench or whatever whatever they want to U memorialize their own loved ones with so to sum it up um I think we've done our best to secure grants donations fund raise and get volunteers and we do plan to keep doing that to the extent that's possible um but in order to maintain some of these things I think that we might need to fund them at some point um so we're basically asking for increase to keep up with inflation for things like utilities to cover an an extra open day um a few extra hours and a small increase in pay and um to add a specific line for funding programs that were previously taken out of office supplies and I'd really love to see an increase in the repair and maintenance budget um so we can have a little extra in case of emergencies um at the very beginning of this fiscal year we had the toilet emergency that blew our entire um maintenance budget budget for the year so when it came things to you know when it came to the things that we knew we were going to need to do like elevator maintenance or fire extinguisher maintenance we were already over budget um so I I hope that I've been able to show you why it's important to fund the library um I think it can be really a community Hub and a place where people can get to together learn socialize um that's it I guess any questions for Lyn [Music] anyone nice very nice work thank you public speaking should be my budget for uh what's that line I don't morning yeah education education and training yes but look at the skills you're growing for free yes I hate I hate talking just so you know that's why I have so many slides thank you actually you should work with our other department heads on SL building I'm much better at behind the scenes fantastic thank you I Mr Hansen sir our Public Works director you know what I was getting that right you know what I was getting that right last any questions you have certainly just jump right in and ask them uh any Applause let's keep him till the end if you could [Laughter] please feet inside the vehicle until we come to a Full Stop sir good evening guys uh so I really got just a four things we want to talk about you all have the budget in front of you um if you could move on to the next slide Tim this is one of our biggest issues in town and everybody is dealing with this issue um on the left you see what we'd really like to see to the very right of that you see what we have um we we've uh we that's like I said that's been our biggest increase in the budget this year hopefully um it uh $250,000 it'll allow us to do about three and a half miles next year uh or this year uh last year we did two miles um on Forest Avenue made a huge difference uh my plan at this point is to jump back and forth uh on either side of the river uh this summer uh provided the funds are there we will do the Strickland Road $250,000 allows us to do about approximately three and a half miles of Road Strickland Road unfortunately is 4.2 miles so we won't be able to do all of it but we'll get the majority of it in I know I know a couple happy Strickland roaders like to hear that I yeah I bet uh counselor I would have to imagine at at any road that we do you're going to find some Happ right now next slide please Tim this just gives you an idea of you know we people have talked about Paving Cycles in the past and I I I had heard it when I first come here every year saying that we were on a 10-year Paving cycle well if you're on a 10-year Paving cycle in this town you've got to be doing eight miles a road a year we we never had we we were doing uh half a mile and they were calling it a 10-year Paving cycle but uh if if you just look down through that um that that tells you last year what we did put us on a 40-year Paving cycle it's it's really simple um if we were to spend 288,000 this year that would put us back on a 20e cycle 396,000 15year 576,000 10-year Paving cycle what what I really want you to take away from this slide is think about the road that you're driving on today what it's going to look like in 40 years if that's when it gets paved next uh next slide please to when you say Paving you mean actual like Paving or we just shimming roads no that this is what I'm talking about today is Paving when we do shimming it's with our own forces with our own Trucking with our own Drag Box paper so you sham and then this budget is to actually do the paving over that later we we have like on the west road we did a quarter point shim four or five years ago in hopes that we were going to do some meaningful Paving over it we we never have been able to but fortunately that's held up pretty well that that road would be oh there would probably be about two-thirds of a road there left in that section where we did that by Farm Park had we not done it then so it it's still there and it's still beneficial to the next Paving project that goes through right I know a lot of towns Frozen on shimming Cycles instead of caving Cycles so they shim a road to pee people and then they move on and they never come back so by the time they do come back it's time to shim it again and it still hasn't been fully repaired absolutely and and we're we're beyond that we we can't do that any longer we we need to do meaningful pain Paving projects to try to get us out of this patching cycle with this slideshow is not going to be heavy on statistics like the PD and the fire but one statistic I can give you is that we we probably PED in about 7 million potholes last year and and every one of those is Multiplied through the winter so now you're who knows how many you know so there there's a statistic with the uh chip sealing there like you did on the McCrae Crossroad what what was the cost per mile what that figure out to be because I mean that's that's held up well it really has and I I I I was going to talk about that a little bit oh we we would love to do some more of that that right there so you could consider that shimming and resurfacing because not only are we chip sealing if you remember the McCrae Crossroad was so misshapen it was just rough chip seal does not do anything except for resurface the road it doesn't smooth it out at all okay but we we we we purchased a little pug mill here a few years ago and we're able to produce our own sand shim and that's how we did McCrae Crossroad we we shimmed it and then chip sealed it and we ended up with a pretty decent product compared to what it was um and we can do that for about half the cost of Paving all all in with materials and we do it with our own forces right from start to finish um I so we we need to focus on Paving right but there are some roads and I'll give you an example of one the old East Road right those people are suffering out there the farmers that travel that road I I feel terrible for them I I would love to do one mile of that that's about a two mile road right so Tim and I have talked about this a little bit if if we could free up a little bit in cash flow and use some of what was our Reserve money um over over the time I piled down the stone needed and the sand needed for the shim what I need to buy is is the liquid and we're looking at about $40,000 to do a mile now that shim and surface um we we could not only do this Paving project but then we could do a mile of old East gr but yeah for those less roads less traveled I mean that's and it makes a huge difference McCrae Road I I travel it quite often just to see how it's doing and it's holding up well y y and and it's made a difference for you folks I'm sure yeah I I travel that road a lot yeah exactly he too um so what you're looking at here is the operating budget per mile of uh the the town surrounding us um and and what this this is a simple equation what this is is the budget divided by the mile of roads that it's taken care of okay so uh prescy spending 20,000 Caribou 18 the in the gray um you'll see main do Center Line mile winter maintenance only the main do is paying contractors that the the same amount for winter maintenance that we are spending year round on our roads now one thing that is not included in pasas Island Caribou is their equipment maintenance reserves right or their equipment replacement reserves um so that would skew that number even further because we have no equipment replacement reserves they do I didn't put that in there because it wasn't readily available so we we're we're we're just over half of what they're spending on maintenance per mile road now that's winter maintenance that's everything guys just I I don't want anybody um so if you look at that really what that means is is we should be plowing about half as much as they are uh next any questions on that uh so uh this is a 2007 International um this is our newest wheeler in the fleet uh that's 16 years old 16 plus years old at this point and uh th this is a year older than when most people are that's the end of the line from you know most organizations at that point that that do what we do you might get more out of them but we wouldn't they so why do we have a picture of burning truck um this this was the last newer used truck that we purchased okay and this was a very nice truck we we were really happy with it at the time that we bought this it was I think it was five years old and and we were kind of moving forward with a plan of replacing with newer U stuff that the truck had 60,000 miles on it it was it was a serviceable truck it was great um unfortunately what that was though is the early years of the regen and Def system and ultimately that's what they said caused that truck to end up in in this situation that's me park behind the truck I was following it while it was plowing and saw the Flames come out the side and told the driver to pull over stop and get out um the uh I I would love to continue on with that policy of replacing with with newer Ed we a truck that's 250 to 300,000 you know we were getting for 60 70,000 and and we would have gotten a good long time out of it we could have went through our Fleet and would have been okay the problem is that happened and then month months later the Dot Garage burnt down because of the same reason as what they think so to put that truck in our garage at night or a similar truck and have it burn our garage down we couldn't recover from that so it scares me to death but there there is hope on the horizon because there has been discussion in the legislature about exempting municipalities um from the the uh the emission standards really yeah now it it's bit just discussion but if they were to do that so if you have any poll with anyone make sure you push for that because that would really help us out tremendously if we could do that and we could take that $60,000 truck have it deleted make it safe I I would do that in a minute yeah State Legislature or federal state the trucks burning that wasn't a used truck problem those trucks were doing that brand new right no the one at the the one at the do garage I think was a year old less than a year old so it it wasn't a used truck problem it's it's a problem with the system because I remember oconor back in 2013 oconor had a recall well it wasn't even a recall but all of the municipalities down dumping them hundreds school buses truck exactly um so so we're we're really in an issue uh with equipment we we're we're doing our best to keep what we have going because we at the moment we can't afford new and we don't want to risk buying used no no good replacement uh this just gives you an idea guys that this number on the western star that this gentleman from Fort Kent did not want to sell a truck I don't think because that number is crazy high uh but anyway in 2002 um that was our last new truck purchase here at the town and and really i' think a real real realistic number on that 20 24 Western Star uh with negotiation would be 300,000 or under but it gives you an idea of inflation right uh next slide please same um we we bought one of these BOS uh almost new in 2019 uh 2020 uh it was just months old still had the warranty on it had 200 hours I think we paid 100,000 um when we checked here about a month ago it was 147,000 for the machine next slide please this is our old Champion grader um this was purchased from the state had gone through a complete reconditioning and since then we've we've actually um had to rebuild the motor uh I think it was two years ago the greater is still fairly serviceable but if you could put up the next slide please to th this would be the replacement for that grater uh and really what I wanted you to see here is the difference of that greater with pile equipment and without it it's a considerable amount of money it's it's $40,000 or thereabouts um set up for for our needs next slide please uh and this this is one of the the fors that we purchased last year this has made a huge difference for us the these are not everything um but they they sure have made a difference I when we first purchased these I said if we could use those for 30% of the plow and they'd be worth having around this year we've used them for 70% because of the winter we've had um that truck new this year is is in the 130 some thousand range completely equipped to plow um the the great thing about these trucks is that they've allowed us to use start using part-time help we've gone from 10 full-time employees down to nine and then we're using part- timers that that we could use in these trucks they that they're under CDL uh I'd like to have two or three more and and we'll find them we've got one that's really worked out well and uh it's an interesting job that we do people people really think that they want to do it until they do it they realize what it is uh next slide please that thing has been bulletproof we built that inhouse out of a a drmo truck that the police department has got had gotten us so that's worked out it has worked out wonderfully um as a matter of fact the the the two 550s are down for uh repairs right at the moment and the 450 is is still operating uh with the dreaded six ler once again just a price comparison on on what loaders were and what they are today um and we're this is our newest loader of 2004 kamasu um so it's it's getting up there we we've uh We've pretty much reconditioned that loader over time though that uh we rebuilt the motor inhouse um and unfortunately we lost a transfer case in it uh three years ago and it had to it had to go down to the kamasu dealership because the cab and everything had to be removed to replace it uh next slide please to all right so this is the last slide that we have uh labor cost comparison and what this show is entry level okay um and and it's it's uh some departments have uh step increases Merit increases throughout some do not so it's it's not perfect but it's pretty close and I just wanted you to get a feel of where we are compared to other departments and and where we are is on the bottom end uh we we went through a big turnover here a couple years ago and it wasn't an enjoyable experience don't really want to go through it again um so what we what we put in this budget there was a 3% contractual increase I believe this is the last year on our Union contract but uh all the employees from grounds PE keeper maintenance uh to um the general mechanics we have a general mechanic body shop and then Master Mechanic up to the general mechanics I'd like to see a 50 C flat raise plus the 3% just to get a little closer to where everybody else is uh some two of our employees actually drive through the city of Pascal to get here so you can see the problem that could come above that I believe that's it is SC police staff uh much like uh the PD uh fortunately we are one of the only Public Works departments around that are fully staff I think the answer to that is no Dan I think they had staffed up but then I believe four or five had left my understanding of the last conversation I had is that they were they were teetering back towards being closer to fully staff without the without the mechanics but so we were able to get two former employees back uh but we we have some new employees still and I can tell you that you you really don't have a a plow man um General all-around Public Work employee fully trained for probably a few years depending on the employee you have your wheelers out this winter the big on uh like I said Dan it was probably 30% I I it was just the opposite of what I had hoped it would have been I I had said if if we could run the wheeler 70% and the small trucks 30 um it was just the office that we had run the small trucks 30 or 70% and the wheelers 30 which saved us fuel um it just saved us all the way around maintenance and repairs we we've had a good winner um and and if you look at our maintenance repair line right now we we'll we'll probably spend it all throughout this year but it's catching up on past issues that we weren't able to take care of because our budget was kind of locked up any questions uh do all of our employees have CDLs or they do not most of them um all of the full-time employees with Benefits have CDLs but the part-time employees do not uh excuse me all of everybody except for the the the body shop operator and the groundskeeper maintenance um The Body Shop man he he plows the sidewalks for the trackless it doesn't require a CDO and the round keeper maintenance he plows but it's with a one ton with a salt topper we do on Sand this year do we actually need to buy sand we will need to buy sand but I think it'll be half the amount but I'd like to try something different with that because with the freezing rain events that we're having and with the warm-ups uh one thing about roads like ours right you don't want to go dump straight salt on them because you don't want the freeze Tha action with the holes that we have in them it it it'll just blow them out and we'll have nothing within a week's time but we're we're kind of having it anyway um so with the freezing rain events I I want to have some salt that sand that has a higher content of salt in it so we can fight that a little little better so there there will be some saving on sands but I think that we'll use those savings and invest it into salt for next year is salt sand stored in a building it it is y yep my Flor any additional questions for Mr Hansen thank you Mr talking about the rec department come on now then our eyes will get used to it and nobody will see all the no slides no slides right down to business um Tim did they have a wages breakdown in theirs or is just uh I can get to that uh I I just did the straight wreck department um okay yeah actually out of five years I I draw those out but I can pull that up if we could pop that up can I and I and now you need the light back off can you guys see [Music] that it's all right it's all right wait I get it messy up there travel sh good luck thanks you're pretty close on your guest though too it's 7:25 you're like I think about 7:30 is be a yeah I just got message thank you for that we'll see you guys later thank for coming we ready to roll yes sir okay for Fairfield Parks and Recreation Department um it has been a f fantastic year of growth in my opinion um I'm really excited uh to see what the future holds for us moving forward uh we have a lot of good things uh planned um so I'm excited and I hope hope they all uh come to fruition um not going to get into too much detail on some of those because um they they uh they incorporate grants and stuff that we can't say too much about just right now um but I do I would like to go down my budget lines and discuss any questions you might have regarding uh my proposed budget my goal always when creating these budgets uh is to ensure that we have enough funds to properly run the department and ensure that each line reflects what they are going to spend that that we're going to spend or we we realistically need uh to run properly and efficiently um before we get down into the salaries list I'd just like to go over a few things as far as our programming goes um our programs have been skyrocketing as far as participation goes all of our um seasonal programs have been anywhere from 85 to 100 Kids participating in them um it's a lot it's a lot to handle um as we get down to salaries and talking about staff I will point out that we will be looking to hopefully add additional part-time help not looking for any extra full-time help but uh just to help some of those programs because they are getting large and we do need extra help to to make sure that those are running uh properly um I will add that we continue to have close connections with the northern main Community recck Association um which allows us to Branch out to arusa County Recreation departments and allows our kids uh to get involved with other rusa County Recreation uh departments and another kid and allows us to have field trip opportunities um obviously um seasonal Sports uh championships things like that so we're making sure that we stay um in close connections with with that crew uh some of the projects that we've worked on uh just recently um some of you have saw already that we we moved our fitness facility so we have a brand new fitness facility same same equipment but new facility new area um which also allowed us to open up our stage where right now we're using that as our um our game room slash we have a golf net now so adults can come in and utilize that whenever they like obviously we can use that now for if somebody wanted to have a pageant there or or an event um we now have that stage for that um for that use uh we've worked with fire chief to get our dance hall permit back we hadn't had that in quite a few years so that's huge snowmobile club just used our facility for a big fund raising event so it allows um any groups and organizations um to utilize our facility at no cost and and and help support them so it's it's really really great that that we can do that once again um outdoor Court revitalization project uh We've we've gotten to a good start there um we're waiting to hear back on a grant in the next couple weeks um if we hear good news there's good chance that in the next year year and a half we could have a brand new facility down there um which would be brand new basketball courts new tennis courts pickle ball courts um that would allow us to to just utilize that a lot more in the summertime host events um expand our programming more in the summertime so we're really hopeful that that that that uh pulls through um so fingers cross on that because that that that's going to be a huge addition to the town to have a brand new facility down there um let's jump right down into salaries um the biggest changes here uh in regard to the budget are the following um adjustments for minimum wage that's where you're going to see the biggest difference and that's obviously the biggest increase in my budget is the salary line uh we added 5% increase to department heads um I believe the the town needs to continue to push for competitive wages for our employees um for the simple fact of um keeping our employees here for a long time uh I've witnessed firsthand uh you if you don't pay your employees they won't be there long so I think it's very important that we that we remain competitive with with surrounding communities um which is why adding that 5% increase and of course I think our department heads back there are more than deserving um and they work hard at what they do so I think that that we're more than deserving for that proposed increase there um removing the wages for a pool director um I feel that it's it's pretty much impossible these days to find our Timo anymore a guy that can work 40 hours in the summertime has his Summers off um and is qualified to to operate a pool like that um they're just not there anymore um this past summer I ran the pool as the pool director um I F I felt it went well all I really did was just kind of move my office down there and kind of ran business down there uh worked really really well um it also helped when we had you know any potential riff raft down there I was already there to kind of settle that down a bit um so it's that's you know that's our main place down there in the in the summertime is the pool that's where all our traffic is so it really helps to have me down there rather than up here um so I think that's something we really need to continue doing is um and I don't see the use for a pool director wage anymore if it's something I'm qualified to do and I can be there down down there in the summertime and still run the department um as it should be run so so we removed that uh which last year was about a 7 $7,200 um cost to us so that would no longer be on our budget um changing our part-time help from 20 hours to 40 hours um as like I said as our seasonal programs continue to grow we find ourselves needing more trained paid staff to help facilitate these programs uh this adjustment will also allow us to provide more open gym time to uh hours and keep the building open more whether it be two part part-time employees at 20 hours a week three part times at 13 hours a week um we do need the help um our volunteer staffs that we usually have those are those are the staff members that we have that you know coach help coach and stuff we still need people uh trained people that are going to be here when the facil is open to monitor the kids uh help us out in the programs whether it be um coaching a little bit on the side just keeping the kids organized uh officiating I could always use another official Tim would stand by on that one um somebody else to yell at it' be helpful to have at least one yeah just not not me all the time somebody else to yell at would be great would be awesome I would't feel as bad at the end of the day it was great it was a great experience it was fun we had a lot of fun um Tim C ended up winning um no favorites I swear I swear no favores record swe moving on anyway um oh gosh like I said we have you know close to 100 participants in all these seasonal programs and we're constantly needing uh you know more officials uh that are trained to do so um more people just there to keep the kids organized keep the the chaos under control is what I what I like to call it the organized chaos um running score the score clocks things like that um we really need it so I I'd really like to up that uh from 20 hours to to 40 hours part-time um obviously two to three helpers would be great um for those seasonal programs um then that increase in uh increase in our pool staff numbers compared to last year um on average we it it um it takes about 2400 to 2500 hours to run that pool properly uh and efficiently and safely um when we look when I looked at my current budget hours for this year uh technically we only budgeted around 1790 um but once again we didn't have a pool director um so we were basically running funds off the pool director's you know wages and incorporating that into um pool staff hours which obviously doesn't reflect a proper amount of what we would normally you know run the pool with as far as our lifeguarding staff um so this year I'm requesting 2500 which is more on our normal wages so that's where you're going to see a big increase on that line as far as if you can barely see up above on there on our pool St St um that's at 35 358 um as opposed to this year which would have been around 255 um I keep in mind that 7200 that was for a um pool director was kind of absorbed into that as well so it's not really that big of a difference um when it comes down to it in in total but we want like I said we want to make sure that our are reflecting uh what we you know what we're using them for so pool staff if we're running 2500 hours that it needs to show it on the budget line that you know that's how much we're using them for and not you know in two different places so we just want to make sure that it's consistent and is that to keep it open at the shortened hours that we had last year or to go back to the hours so it would still be six days a week five hours five hours a day um if this however if this passes what I would like to do starting in July when it does pass is at least get limited um hours on Sunday so it wouldn't be a full five hour day but it would be shortened a little bit and then obviously we do offer on Sundays um rentals so anybody wants to hold a birthday party or something there we're still holding our staff there you know to to guard it so that's still hours that we need to pay um not the evenings no instead because we went we went away from two different shifts it's still the same hours uh we just went away from two shifts and did one long shift so instead of you know the six to8 shift and the one to four shift we did a 12 to5 shift which seemed to work a lot better for us um minor issues with the chlorinator keeping up just with you know not having that break in between um but I don't see it being an issue moving forward it it just see it did seem to work a little bit better um we're also thinking about potentially having every once in a while just an adults only evening uh maybe a couple times a month um maybe even once a week I kind of an adults only couple couple hours in the evening time as well so just a few additions for this coming season um I think that was it for anything that might have been changed on the um salary lines any other questions about salary changes and um as you can see some of our coaches are paid um we did that um and this was here as well when when Kevin was here we we kept these lines specifically because because um we want our coaches to stay a long time right now we have our varsity coach coaching Pony League we have our Varsity softball coach coaching our girl softball like how how much better does that get right there you're having your varsity coaches coaching these kids who are eventually going to be up into that program um and they're already going to learn exactly what the what what needs to be learned for them to get to that level and play at that level so we would really like to keep um those coaches there in that position and that's one of the reasons why we pay these these positions our swimming coach and our tennis coach are the same coach and she does a fantastic job the numbers we have in in our swim team and our and our tennis has skyrocketed um in the years we've had 40 to 50 just in tennis um we're anywhere in between usually 40 to 60 in swim team as well we're we one of the only swim teams left honestly um definitely the largest aside from Fort Kent and um a few from Mapleton as well but we're the largest out of those two teams our tennis team's very competitive now uh lots of championships and and medals won this summer so um she does a great job and and she's absolutely deserving of being a paid coach in our programs and we're lucky to have her um coaching those so that's some of the reasons why we pay some of our coaches um and other coaches aren't just volunteers do we still have little Le uh we do yep you do yep we just had our little Le meeting actually just before I came down here yep we have two Co two volunteer coaches that are in the Little League um organization uh Doug singer he's still coaching and then the whites um as well as Mick Browning they coach the other team so we do have two little league teams as well um it's it's a little different than what it used to be it's not um a major league program where it's uh different Recreation departments they still do offer that but we decided a few years ago that we were going to join the little league this was before my time um and that's run by kibou kibou has their own little league sanction so we've basically joined their league um as Fort Fairfield teams so we do but we have to follow their rules is the only thing is so do you feel I mean if you're putting your time down the swimming pool you're comfortable with how everything else is going while you're down there I think it went fantastic yeah absolutely I think all all our other programs went really really smooth uh no no issues uh the baseball teams they were more than dedicated and helpful to prep some of their fields whenever you know they had a a double header you know they they needed it done immediately they they grabbed the stuff and went at it it's a busy time of the year it isart it is it's chaos um y especially you know Festival week they're still playing baseball games and I'm comfortable with your ti being having your time pool absolutely yep good yep for you I think it really worked out well Doug when you ramp Folks up to to 40 hours though it doesn't trigger any benefits package or I mean this is just 40 hours as a b as a as a part-time summer employee exactly yep yeah exactly yep all I'm doing is just trying to increase that line so that I can have more part-time help that's all just increasing that line doubling it up so like I said if we need three helpers at 13 hours a week then we can we can make that happen so that's um can we find free helpers I have fre helpers right now yeah I have the only problem is is that's where we run into the issue is are they all are all three of them always available they're all high school kids they all play sports so that's why it's always nice to have extra people you know on on the payroll and ready to go so that if they're playing a basketball game or a soccer game I I have somebody back up that's that's there ready to help so um yeah that's that's exactly why I want uh that increased a little bit one more questions on salary it's tough to have a swim team with a splash pad that was the other that's probably another question something something we don't want to pay for either I will tell you that it is sorry all right uh regular move that yeah right back to the administration would be great um I kept all those lines the same um obviously except uh phone internet cost due to obviously anticipated rate increases on those um our advertising and marketing line we really haven't been using that we've just been using our social media platforms and it works fine um so what I what my thought was talking with Tim is I'd really like to switch that line um or at least take that funds and and move them down to um miscellaneous or just change that line completely to first aid and safety we really don't have a line like that um on our budget and you know working with kids and and and being uh you know Recreation based there's always scrap scratches and scrapes and you know we're always dealing with that stuff um and not only that when we have events you know we might need you know safety vests or things like that or some extra cones or you know so it's it's really a line that i' I'd really like to switch over um and keep on our our Budget moving forward something directional signs you know things like that safety signs anything that we might need I think that's a proper fitting in our department and and should be should be changed from advertising and marketing um like I said we really just we just don't use it our social media everybody uses Facebook and whatnot now so I radio stations are kind of in these days that's I think that's really the only time we ever used it is to put out an ad on on a radio station um but word of mouth and Facebook and whatnot just that's how everybody interacts these days and I think we're going to stick to that so that's kind of my request is to keep that line as is but just switch it to possibly safety materials um any questions on Administration I don't know if you saw but I just saved you $70 by figuring out my health insurance map was wrong oh so if anybody just watch that number change me crazy how is that not up sorry thanks uh swimming pool then we'll move down to swimming pool um only thing I really adjusted on that the pool maintenance uh that pool system uh that makes that pool run is unpredictable and it's expensive to replace and you really don't know when a part of something and that pool could fail um we need to have more more funds in that line uh than we currently have in preparation for anything that may happen aside from regular regular yearly maintenance for example last year uh before the season we had unexpected electrical repairs needed that was um after they kind of investigated was believed to be caused by a power outage and just the power surge that kind of fried a lot of things in there um in the off season um so just unexpected things filter systems chlorinators um pumps you know electrical all that stuff um is expensive and it it's what makes the pool run and if we don't have you know funds to replace those things when needed then you know we don't have pool and that's a big part of our summer right there that's it draws a lot of people into our community um and it's a place for for our youth and our families to enjoy um and gather and it's a big part it's a big part of our Recreation Department we need to make sure that we fund that um and as a reminder that pool was funded by donations um and grants Time free time and labor um I feel like it'd be doing we'd be doing dis disservice by not funding our maintenance lines properly and being prepared for um any kind of mechanical failures or just regular maintenance that that needs to be done uh yearly so I did increase that I think by a thousand compared to last year the uh circulator pumps what's the so we called the Rogers Electric actually this afternoon and he was hoping to have an answer for us early next week when we extrapolate out on the calendar we have until about next week or the week after today oh yeah so he did not have an answer for us today we called yeah and kind of made sure he knew we need an answer as quick as we can get one but right now we're sitting at about nine weeks till the pool opens yeah so that should make everybody feel good that's looking at snow outside the window and I mean I don't want to get anybody too excited either but we the amount of people we've talked to and the you know how positive they were on on um their thoughts that they would they would be fine those pumps would be okay um makes us feel a little bit better but you know we won't know until we know but fingers crossed anyway that we shouldn't have any issues and extra extra unnecessary costs on that line um swimming pool any other questions uh program expenses I left all of those lines the same as well um aside from lowering our bus driver expenses uh looking at this year's usage I don't think we needed the uh as much as as much as we put in there um last year so I think I dropped 500 off of that to, 1500 from 2,000 um I think we only really have one more big field trip where we need a bus which is coming up in April and then we don't use a bus again until school goes back in so um usually it's about $300 or so every time we need a bus so every you think every week long break that the kids have I think there's about five or so of those maybe four we don't do Christmas break just because all families are always away going on vacation so we we could just use our van if we did want to plan anything as far as field trips go but um we wouldn't need a bus for that many kids so so decided be best to lower that one other than that we um kept all the all the other lines the same youth activities uh those are essential we need to keep those the same those are for anytime we have you know a like I said an nmc event where we're going to a championship or a tournament uh that comes out of that anytime we're uh spending funds for um a holiday event or something and we want to rent rent out something um I know Darren mentioned a bounce house so I'll bring it I'll bring up a bounce house if we want to rent out a bounce house for like our our Halloween event we rent it out a couple that we usually do every year so that's where that um those funds come from uh any questions on program expenses and our last one is upkeep and maintenance um the biggest one like we said is utilities um that's going to be our biggest projected increase um I was able to cut fuel uh and Lube by half so our fuel and um Lube blinds I dropped from 2500 to 1250 we only have one vehicle now so it just makes sense to to chop that in half um we're doing quite well right now on on that line as far as fuel goes Fuel and Lube goes so I I think it I'd be a lot lot more comfortable splitting that in half and we should be just fine with our wck van at that rate um vehicle maintenance I did lower as well to uh I think I took vehicle maintenance I took a thousand off that as well I don't see any major repairs coming up with our rec van it's in pretty good standing pretty good shape so um I felt comfortable comfortable with lowering that as well um wreck maintenance uh where are we Sorry Building Maintenance and Repair um Tim and I talked and we are having some some work currently done off and on whenever available um a lot of you saw it when we did our tours uh the brick and concrete work on the inside um of the wreck department there's a lot of cracking in the walls um so that that money is placed there to help kind of offset some of those costs that are going to be coming our way uh whenever Chris can't Bell get gets a chance to get to him I know he's a busy guy so he's going to work away at it whenever he can um and that's why we put that that amount in there is to to help with those costs of keeping our building uh from falling in I think that's pretty much it any questions on upkeep and maintenance uh we're always looking for Grants as well we're always keeping our eyes and ears out for potential grants to to help fund like I said um area recreational areas uh to help keep those where they need to be um I know there's there's one that I'd really like to talk talk about right now but I'm not GNA me me and Tim has brought it to my attention um good opportunities are coming our way let's just put it this way so we're excited about Recreation the future of recreation um we're always looking to better our community anyway we can um and expand opportunities and programming uh wherever wherever and whenever possible so I I think the the future's bright and I'm excited to see what happens down the road thank you guys for your time thanks your future of [Music] the so I didn't hear the whole story but Holton is doing what is it doing new pickle ball yep are they starting from ground zero and building this okay yes they are so do we have any idea like where they're starting what company they're using or um I did talk to him this Wednesday at our at our rec director's meeting um so they they pretty much got all their money from donations from the community it was paid in full by Community donors that are big pickle ball lovers um and I do know that the groundwork which he said cost about $30 ,000 just for the groundwork is being donated by one of their local construction companies so they're doing that completely for free for them I I do not know the rest of the cost as far as the slab and whatever else but yeah they're starting from scratch they're brand new pad and everything so I imagine it's not going to be cheap from starting from scratch that's going to be you know 200k probably yeah he I don't think I don't think he mentioned a PR a full price for me but um and it's not a full facility like what we have here it's not tennis court size it's pickle so it's smaller but there's I think there's four courts or so so it's still still a decent size but it is costly it's expensive like I said the the one that word the the route that we're trying to go through is is the cheapest way about 160k um but that's a top surface that that covers what we currently have um basically a plastic rubber surface that goes over the top of this one um Everybody I've talked to said it would last through our weather uh there should have no issues with cracking uh they said it's an expandable material so in the winter and summer times when everything expands and contracts it's not going to cause any kind of damage um it's the it's the cheapest route to go and and the most efficient route to go um rather than starting from scratch if we start from scratch on that giant slab that we have out there we're looking at you know $300,000 you know minimum to have somebody come in and do that so we went with the more cost efficient uh way so we're waiting on we're about halfway there um if we get this grant we'll be there so fingers crossed for sure yeah it'll be a great addition to that area for sure we have a nice pool facility and I'd love to see that that Court uh new building that's just about complete down there I'd love to see that Court there it's just it's just going to open up a lot of opportunities for us you know we can we can host tennis uh tennis tournaments we can have our three Onre Festival basketball outdoor if it's nice enough you know we could have our alumni games down there you know it's it just opens up a lot more of opportunities for us I even told you know Larry Gardner I was like hey what a cool idea if you could have some of your Tiger basketball camps games down there you know during the summertime um lot of lot of opportunities that could be opened if we have that new facility so hoping for the best for sure any addition yeah no problem okay the lights off uh yes please sir uh so I'll just get right into my presentations and if you have questions comments or concerns uh hold them feel free to ask uh so as I right down this journey so I'm six months in on this on this gig uh six months of wondering what I'm thinking uh but this is really kind of what I was thinking as I started to put my budget together just the fact that it's it not just a collection in numbers but an expression of values and aspirations and I guess what does that mean there's an awful lot of numbers on these Pages an awful lot of numbers in these sheets of paper um but really what it talks about is how do we move this community forward and how do we achieve the goals that we've set for ourselves um and so I I guess I'd like to just kind of dig right into the budget that I controlled most directly which is the ad Administration budget uh so you'll see that the overall total admin budget increases less than 1% how do we achieve that well the main reduction is a we've reduced one uh staff member from the town office due to retirement and uh we will not be replacing that position Ina and instead uh shifting those savings into other staff and other front office needs um other other items that I I want to focus on uh increases in training um you know it's we know quite a bit we have a lot of responsibilities and duties but those responsibilities and Duties are always changing Matt already touched on unfunded mandates um just the different work that we do in the town office is is um it's greatly regulated and it's and it's always changing uh there's no lack of bills being debated by the legislature every session and it always seems to impact the municipalities uh without a lot of help on the financial side uh so other highlights within that admin budget a $1,000 increase in elections it's a presidential election year uh we have met with uh Security Professionals related to elections um and we're in great shape um but we also just need to realize that um every Year's the most contentious election cycle um and and that's something that we have to keep in mind as we move into it uh the total increase on the line for the town office from last year's budget to this year's $129 um too much well too much you know I'll take a day off and we can reduce it uh I promise um another change that we've got to look at is the equipment lease line uh we have to change our our our email service um we had to change on the Fly and and this is this is I find a big public we changed our payroll provider on the Fly yesterday um because it just was a really crummy situation that we were put into um but the information that we have been being emailed about our I'm still waiting for the the packet to come from our previous payroll Ro uh supplier U we got sent one packet on a Friday that we got Tuesday um our email is awful um and it's embarrassing and it's not safe um that's going to change our cost from $50 a month to $289 a month but we'll also get rid of my paper calendar uh and if you know how much I love my paper calendar uh you'll you'll realize how much that that's worth uh plating me for um so anyway other expenses on the legal line I'm really looking more at survey costs there than expecting uh increases in legal expenses uh and again the training you know we have great people and in in place uh we just want to ensure they know how to do their job we may remain compliant and uh retain and obtain the necessary credentials this budget addresses that utility costs energy costs are high and getting higher um we are looking at ways to reduce our overall cost or efficiency programs um and reducing the impact of that longterm um any questions on that I know it's hard to see that you folks have copies in your hands as well no one I'll keep moving did I mention energy costs uh the increased drivers uh for our community center safety and sanitation our energy costs um if you look at our heating oil and coal costs uh we budgeted 45,000 last year we're looking at 50,000 this year that actually may be an under budget because our coal burner uh is ceasing to operate efficiently and effectively and we need to explore ways to potentially um switch to a different Source I'd love to say maybe propane is our is our future but I I really just don't know uh one of the goals we have right now as a staff is to seek a full energy audit from efficiency main both for lighting and heating on all Town own facilities uh building repair another uh Conant theme throughout all of our budgets our buildings just have not been given the love and and care that they need and many are old this building not this Edition we're we're in an 18 year old Edition or 17y old Edition here but the we're attached to a 60 or 7 year old building we just need to continue to if we want to extend the life of these facilities we've got to maintain them again another energy cost driver on the street lights line it does appear to be down by this estimate but I I think I was in between uh bills revers it because they certainly they certainly seem to come every two weeks out every month right now I don't know why um so anyway just something that we've got to look at uh I'm also putting a little exra to public fire protection um but I may be a little bit over budget uh in my my concerns there from the utilities but I know with their increased costs uh due to the to the new lagoons and some um pump repairs that that may be something that we have to do just absorb uh Insurance being uh so wages energy Insurance those are the big three I think I've talked about them uh every month since I I took this job and they continue to be massive issues um the town did switch insurance providers last year and yielded significant Savings of about $20,000 um our insurers looking into a potential for us to switch again there is a new insurer on the marketplace in May um but it really is the cost of replacement and the cost of disasters else that are driving some of these premiums um I can tell you that my house uh recently was just reevaluated for insurance and my replacement cost is $660,000 so I put the house on the market for $660,000 if anybody wants to buy it um the other major hit you can see is about the third or fourth line up on work comp uh we are getting hammered on work C it is not that we do not have safe practices in place it is not that our employees are careless it is not equipment driven it is accidents it is a firefighter taking a step out of a fire truck it is the police officer being kicked and it is other drivers of uh last week I was invited to attend mediation for a work claim that was 16 years old and has cost the town and it's insured from back then a well over half a million dollars so uh I do have a meeting with our uh work comp insurer next Friday uh hope to understand what we can do to try to offset this but as you can see I'm budgeting a significant increase in work comp because I don't even believe our most recent injuries are driving this yet um so um stay tuned on that one but we're aware of it we participate in the shape program we have monthly safety meetings um and we're looking to eradicate some of the safety issues that we see within our facilities um repairs with the stairways out front um the drains at Public Works which are just a work comp claim waiting to happen um we we're aware of it we understand that it's a problem but it isn't because of practice it's it's because of circumstance I wish there was something more we could do about it and I hope to learn more next week so throw that away uh unclassified expenses so really there's a there's a couple major drivers when we talk about unclassified expenses and we can look at those in a minute but I just wanted to illustrate with these two pie charts the difference to our budget if we pay the full County Special mon B special bill in in a onethird installment which would be on the leftand side or if we pay it in full um when it comes to our unclassified expenses the county is either 12 or 15% of those that's that's $100,000 $108,000 difference in spending um as you can see the massive piece of the pie chart when it comes to unclassified expenses is the school um what am I expecting to come from the school I'm still not 100% yet but a massive increase is likely I have budgeted $2.7 million as the towns uh as a Town's piece of of uh school budget um I reached out to the superintendent this afternoon looking for an updated number uh and I'm being told that that it may be even higher than that and they'll know though in late April or early May which doesn't really help us nail down our budget quite yet uh other expenses contained in unclassified expenses include things like our membership in main Municipal uh nmdc Central roosted Soil and Water the Humane Society contingency fund and also in there is the Tiff on The Meadows which is about $28,000 or as you can see about 1% again um it is my opinion that we should play pay the full six-month special County tax bill in full this year and not have it hanging over our heads uh and I have a lot of different reasons why I think that makes sense um and part of that's because I don't think it's really a giant cost driver in our budget at least this year and could save us some in the future I'm just this this is just a breakdown of those unclassified expenses and as you can see they have they've increased significantly the school had stayed flat funed um but as you can are relatively flat funded in that third or fourth line item but 2 2.7 million is right now what I'm projecting also another thing to note uh you can see at the red line on the on the screen shows that special six Monon assessment from the county if you extrapolate that out over a full year that puts the county at $350,000 uh versus what we had paid the year before at 295,000 I think they put some cushion in there there to help pay for the potential for interest payments on towns that we only going to pay 13d at a time so I'm not budgeting the county at 350,000 as our full annual budgeted amount I'm I'm guessing that's going to come in closer to 325 I hope I'm right but I just want to point that out there's some some also some uncertainty on that line item as well any questions on any of the unclassified yes sir uh is there any sense that this 2.7 million that you're coping the schol going committ at is there new base and that we could expect incremental increases from that base as opposed to another 3 400,000 jump next year I'm hopeful Dan that's a great question I I did attend a school board meeting um a couple weeks ago um you know certainly their Cod funds have run out um I do think the school did a really smart thing by using a lot of their funding to improve facilities so there isn't they don't have the same level of capital Improvement needs hanging over their heads as the town does we didn't and I'll just say we did not use our funds wisely um you know we didn't use them appropriately and and we're going to continue to pay for that um but I I hope but My worry is that they just entered into a new contract that contract increase for them for for their teachers was about $500,000 of their increase um so without some shuffling of you know older more tenur more more you know higher wage scale teachers retiring um I don't really see a way for them to reduce the impact of the of those uh contracted increases um so I like everything it's getting more expensive I I think you and I had an interesting exchange about the fact that mat is at 4.5 million for local schools and I just at their last meeting million they have 359 kids we are at 472 and a half students as we learned the other day from so and that that's an increase in students you know so I get a strong feeling though that 27 is just the next step in a in a in a yeah and and I'm afraid it won't end at 27 next year which is Again part of the reason I really want to kind of clean up the county this year get some of our Capital stuff taken care of this year when we have a unique opportunity um speaking of Capital Improvements um everybody that was on the tour and again I do appreciate everybody's time coming and taking a look at some of these issues that we have um you know right now we're looking at 300,000 plus just to get Public Works garage um you know basically secured that's roof floor drain a a wall um five bay doors um that I mean just it's just different pieces of the puzzle are starting to fail uh interesting to know we left a department head meeting this week and I'm saying we can't really L on CDs we never know when it's coming out and and 45 minutes later they announced CDs was open so we're going to take a shot I felt bipolar uh for a few minutes there because I'm like guys don't worry about CDs and then I'm like run let's apply apply apply um Community set our needs again 150,000 minimum just to get a few of the the main pieces of our of our our puzzle back into place um you could see you know these doors replacing them would be 24,000 what you can't see in the glass up there's one of those is plexiglass and one of those is tape um but they they look nice from here um so yeah they do so certainly Capital Improvements and I and I have a whole list in the budget if you've looked at the budget um I'm adding items as we get uh quotes uh Darren Hansen has been fantastic in helping me get quotes especially for Public Works uh because we really want to put together these strong push the real concern with CDs right now isn't that we wouldn't get finded it's if we get finded we may be three years from having those funds I just don't know that we have that kind of time so I will put that out hence my bipolar like get the money run away it's tough so Debt Service one other item I just wanted to point out and and you know we could hold the Applause for Dan but maybe we should give him another round of applause uh this is this is what we were faced with in the last few years with de Service as you can see with the budget for for this year is a manageable 158,000 I wish we had more to show for that 158,000 but it is what it is and we will continue to to whittle away 880,000 of that is the EMS startup Grant but again I think that's a misnomer um it was a loan used to pay down the tan or pay down the mill rate and and I don't know flush down toilets or something it's just mly um but anyway um the other thing that we got to look at is all the tan carryovers are gone um but we will require tans this year our cash flow projections are unique um and it makes our needs uh strong especially if we seek to do some of the capital improvement work early in the season like putting a roof on in the summer that's going to require a tan right you're going to have to pay for that out of something um and and you're not going to have the cash flow to just absorb that um but it does get paid yes sir it does get paid paid in full absolutely and my hope is I'm making enough interest on the other money that we might offset our Tan in um interest payments we're gonna be all damn close this year I can tell you that much um so anyway the ladder truck being sold the ambulance being sold retire retirement of the municipal bond isn't really a big change uh the thing that that will change is our ability to maybe go out for a different bond in three years time and maybe lump together some other improvements one thing I don't really want to approach but I may be SED at some point in time is is doing another roads Bond um there's there's good and bad to that I I anytime you take on debt you're increasing your costs um I can give you a perfect example we priced out a a plow truck um we we we looked at what loan on that would be uh in over five years at current rates we'd be looking at a $54,000 in interest payments you know that's that's a good chunk of a new Cruiser uh so borrowing our way to Prosperity is likely not to happen um but we can at least borrow for vehicles what we can't borrow for is facilities uh no bank is going to take a mortgage on this building because they can't seize it if we don't pay um and so it's a little bit easier to borrow for vehicles than it is for buildings overall but again if we can go the bonding route and we can watch interest rates uh drop over time maybe maybe there's a point in time when that may make more sense so that's the administrative uh budget components I'm happy to answer questions on that people for before I look into my crystal ball which is actually more of a magic ball I realize now we good to go all right fantastic so uh where are we doing well we're holding steady on most of our Municipal revenues you will see the excise tax though I'm projecting that to continue to decrease and that's because I think the economy is going to not be as strong as it has been I think some of your pent up demand is gone I think vehicle prices are really pushing people out of it the good news is vehicle prices are so high the excise tax is high but I think less people are buying new vehicles and it so it is a little bit of an offset another item that I think is going to have a decrease or continue decrease is our cable franchise fees uh as more people cut the cord on cable uh and you can see those revenues have dropped more than $77,000 almost $8,000 in the last five years I don't think that's something that we can continue to really know Budget on it's not a giant budget driver um oddly enough we show no Snowmobile Registration income in our Trio system really I don't know where it is it boggles the mind sometimes uh what trio decides to show us for information but we took some in even though it was a very short season um hopefully we'll get a rebound on the snow and not have to plow it I I don't know how that'll so here's the surprise in the budget Revenue sharing our projection for Revenue sharing is through the roof um and it is directly related to the property tax on the taxpayers I am not lost on that uh Revenue sharing is a complex formula is so complex I actually wrote it down here in my notes um why I can't grab this on my computer screen though is the I have no idea basically it's the state's monthly Revenue sales sales tax corporate tax and personal tax they take 5% of that they throw it in the pool and then they take your population a mult multiply it by your appropriation and divide it by your state valuation did anybody get that because I think I got it right um and if I didn't I uh please don't hold me to that but that's pretty much how Revenue sharing is calculated and they're saying we're going to get about 2.2 million this year so here's the challenge taxpayer relief is because it's certainly related a a direct correlation to taxpayer pay uh you know if you cut your your mill rate too quickly too fast that Revenue sharing will also plumm it and then you're going to be playing catchup with your mill rate because then your Revenue Shar is going to plummet and then you're going to have to raise taxes and and I so what I sought to try to do in this budget this year is to really utilize this unique gift to try to get our footing back while also not burdening the taxpayers more and then maybe even possibly having a reasonable reduction that doesn't put us in a a a mill rate yo-yo um our Mill rate's already going to change this year and and I've and I've I've said it before multiple times don't get stuck on the mill rate uh mill rate is the how much it cost to buy a car uh every week what you want to know is how much interest you're paying you want to know how much the total cost of the car is and that's really what we need to look at especially with Tony talking about indexing values at 10 % that is going to adjust what our M rate is um so please don't just walk in on what M rate is it doesn't it isn't the driver it what I'm worried about is what is coming physically out of people's pockets because that's what we want to be careful messing around so it just seems that I mean you're right it was going to come back down it went up because we increased property taxes 36% ear that's why that did that but if you're using that for fixed expenses and not operating expenses that gives you more flexibility next year as to what money you're going to allocate for fixed expenses it's not the impact your ability to operate the to corre so I mean I think I think you're you're spot on it is a gift you need to use it for the benefit of the taxpayers and I think that's a great way to great way to to do I I'm GL to hear that because I struggled with I lay in bed at night worrying about it because I I I understand the kneejerk reaction is we won the law but we didn't we we we've already invested in this pain now let's fix the problems so we don't have to go this and that is that is my you that's nothing I I never anticipated that I mean it never it never occurred to me I just never thought about it that we would see that kind of no made sense the homestead places get theair again I when I saw those numbers I held on to them for two weeks because I'm like I don't think this is real um and then I I couldn't really wrap my brain around it and then the other piece of it is I really wanted to see the budgets that our department heads with before without knowing this existed and they all put forward really thoughtful well-crafted budgets that don't go for cash gra so what what what they say after oh I'm sure all of them got together and called me very creative nicknames uh did I say that yes which is fine because I think it wasn't purposely withheld entirely it was just somewhat purposely withheld because I still didn't believe the number was even remotely true I thought there was a mistake yeah but the more we look at it and the more we calculate it and the more we understand what those numbers are we start to to see that you know we paid the the pain the burden of this and and at this point in time we've reduced that and and maybe we take a step to reduce it more but any any ridiculous reduction or any massive reduction is only just G to slingshot us back to where we were last year and I don't want to go through what Dan went through last year and I already know what we're going through this year and it's it's still this is not the most fun seat to sit in though it spins and it's comfy um it's just it's not easy um so what I what I show up here on gross revenue projections property tax I just I just held the line knowing that we can in the budget show that mill rate reduction a mill rate now being equivalent to $25,000 based on our state valuation um but I just I just show that holding on line because I could subtract it out um and that and I have done so in your budgets that you all have in your hands the other things that I I really think are important again I expected more of what we see here with the homestead exemption that Spike that artificial spike in exemption payments because of what happened with the mill rate again I'm projecting that to k a very considerable amount because the mill rate had reduced um I also see the the Betty reimbursement coming down we got lucky that some solar installer did not put their equipment up in time and taxed it but once it's up and running that's not tax it um so I that's that's just kind of its own little unique Spike based on how that program works um really everything else over all makes sense um in terms of Revenue um oh yeah I had other numbers on here I forgot about that um so that's our non-top property tax revenue and our total tax revenue you can see I mean that 2.2 is almost a direct you could see it that 1.2 extra is is you know you go from Seven 7.4 to 8.6 and that's really where that washes out unfortunately there's other cost drivers in there that would maybe allow us to give additional taxpayer relief uh but it really absorbs a giant jump in the schools but if we if we don't realize that that is probably the new normal again you're going to be back to where you are bouncing around so um it's you know the other thing that's not in our budget and and Darren points it out to me daily actually he texts me in the middle of the night is that there is zero dollar in our budget currently for vehicles and again reason being if we had to borrow for them we could but we also have an overlay of about $117,000 that hopefully goes into some sort of rever reserves I believe we will have the potential to have some reserves after the the end of book the books close on this year um but really the hard part about understanding a cash flow is that you really don't know it until late August September you you don't really close the books on your previous year until all your costs against the previous year have been calculated that's that whole um what do they call that Moder moderated acru cash bases it's accounting stuff and I'm not good at it I didn't I didn't really look at this Tim but yeah you've got you got your estimated income for this fiscal year you got your estimated expenses what's the difference between the two what's the estimated difference do you know what I mean oh in terms of what what are you what are you thinking you're looking at for Surplus in this fiscal year yeah that's not overly oh for this year the year that we're in we're in currently yeah I'll be honest well well and I I think there's a problem in Trio and it has been since day one um and and and it's kind of on two fronts one the year the year end close of June 30 of 2023 was not clean there there's a $323,000 bank account wobble I guess is what I would call it that has never come clean in the entire process of this year and I don't trust Trio's numbers the other thing that I don't trust in Trio's numbers are 6.7% of our budget is the tan payoff that does not show his paid off in our in our books even though it's been paid and it's founded for and a journal entry's been made there's some something that has happened within that program that has corrupted that that overall number so when I look at at last year last month's budgeted versus actuals we're showing a trend of about 6.6% Bel a budget but that 6.7% we got all up and we've be spot on the budget so I'm not showing a huge amount of extra but I know there will be yeah there's got to be um and also uh felt should be able straighten that out I have reached out multip times and it has not I I can't figure it out and and part of my frustration with that is a lot of those journal entries to try to clean up the bank account component are per but it doesn't explain the problem no I understand that but it should give you a number it should but that's why I'm like I really don't want to go out say yeah we're gonna walk out of here with 150 I don't fully trust those numbers from right now because it's never been spot on not one day um commitment head was jacked in October and then there was medical issues and it just it became so as a as a banker I would love more um I would love more concrete numbers yes sir um any any questions on anything that I'm putting out there other than how much I hate Trio because I'll talk about that all day long so um kind of a the thought that I wanted to end on is just you know when we look at these numbers today they still a picture of where we want to be and where we've been and the question is where do we want to go and how do we use these funds to invest in our community for a brighter future um I have lots of questions and I look forward to working with each and everyone of move this process forward it's going to take us all down to try to figure this out it can't just be my vision because I'm blinding no because we all live here we all pay taxes we all want something different but we've got to work together so happy day answer any questions anybody has any part of those budgets guys that's a great presentation it really was very very nice questions from you guys hat anything from you no she just she was over here snoring a little bit ago fair fair e no it's a lot to take in is read through read through the numbers they all tell some really interesting stories but I think we're head on a pretty good track budget advisory committee uh Chuck apologize again I know some you guys were filtering in when I check apologize he didn't realize this was on a Thursday his teaching class he's asked me to ask you folks if next Wednesday at 6 o' would be a good meeting time that well I can make ARR Wednesday at 6 is what he was hoping to thanks Tim can we find the down",True

state your name three minutes okay Tim you got the floor thank youo uh under correspondence and reports uh we have no licenses or permits to approve this evening so we'll skip straight ahead to the financial report um and basically as I had uh outlined in my memo to council last week uh this month I performed probably my deepest dive into our budgetary because it's budget season yay um and so uh really haven't seen a lot of massive spikes in pricing uh we have seen some fluctuations uh we've seen some savings on the the plowing side we've seen so that's been nice um The Savings in fuel that we'll see unfortunately be offset by a a failure of a fuel pump monitoring system um but at least we're absorbing that into the budget versus trying to budget out for that item um it's pretty crucial to what we do as a as a public works department um FKS may not be aware that U you know not only do our fire and our police and our wreck utilize the town's gas pumps for that reduced rate that we get um but also housing utilities and the schools uh utilizing um we haven't been able to um break down exactly who uses it's like a key card system that failed was connected to a dot matrix printer so it didn't owe us much um but ultimately we see savings we see costs and that that tends to be the Seesaw battle um as we you know dig into the numbers uh February again uh the B The Big Three that we've been tracking all year labor utilities insurances um all three continue to outpace expectations um and I don't really see that changing significantly as we roll into um as we roll into the budget season it's it's uh wages insurances and utilities are the three biggest driv when we look at our 24 25 fiscal year um we have seen some savings uh we we are kind of shopping around on some insurance stuff just looking at what our options are it's unusual to move to one insur and then leave immediately thereafter um I don't I don't think that's probably what we're looking at but uh we are just trying to understand some of those cost drivers um you know exploring options for savings where we can uh and then uh you guys know me my background as a banker or a I played a banker for a few years um you know we with your uh assistance were able to put about 1.3 million into high yield savings over the past month and a half uh I watch it every day um I probably look a lot like Scrooge McDuck to staff sitting in there C my coins count my interest but it's been uh it's been worthwhile couple thousand dollars that we've earned probably will n us somewhere in the about five or $6,000 what all set you done we're not earmarking those funds because clearly the crystal all of our budget as it's you know it's murky to the finish line so we'll see where we'll land at the end of the at the end of the fiscal year plus it just helps us with our cash flow but uh not uh not too shabby with just a couple phone calls a couple emails um I'm not banking on that so much going into our budgetary for next year because I think uh deposit rates are likely to scale backwards uh especially if interest rates roll backwards um sat through my first budgeting class as a municipal official today I wish I had come a couple months ago um especially with my budget you on Friday um but uh it was a nice affirmation that we're headed the right direction on a lot of it um and I look forward to to getting your feedback and working with you guys through this process I I commend our department heads for really running a tight ship um you know there aren't a lot of surprises our communication's good uh I would say overall financi we're doing as well as we could be as well as could be expected given the financial termal that we've had in the previous couple of years and I'd say our look is a lot more um bright certainly some difficult choices to be made as we move into the next budget cycle uh looking at uh reserves Capital Improvements uh wage inflation um inflation what have you so certainly open to any questions that you guys have there I just wanted to kind of give you a little bit more of a state of the the this finances as we really kind of set the stage going into budget are after this any questions comments or concerns excellent uh the next item up for bids we would ask uh Mr roesy to come forward and provide an update on what's going on out at Artic Waste Solutions Mr J sir a lot of water run off right now I can tell you at some more coming on our P um we met it on March 1st and we'll meet again on March 29th next Friday uh our revenues at the end of the month were had scheduled by 1.6% and our expenses were below by 6.2 so we're right about on track without any surprises uh we won't get our bill from carou for Lee for another month so we may fall a little bit behind once we can catch up on the Lee um Mark was able to complete a wage and benefit survey for us to see we need to be to stay competitive in the area uh we are going to be doing some adjustments but we won't see those until the 2025 budget uh built into our budget this year we had already set aside some Ms for some bonuses that we can give for Exemplar work people do above and beyond we can give them a little bit more as an incentive for that just to say thank you for that um we we have the largest collection of eagles in Artic County without question we have a large collection of people who want to photograph those Eagles at the landfill uh and Mark is proposed a plan for us to let people come into the Landfield and go off to the other Acres on the Landfield not up on the hill to take pictures and see them it's it's a side benefit of the Lan fill be honest with you uh they've had a little bit of issues with people going in and not coming out before we lock the gate at night Mo had to go back so U we're going to work with putting some signage up to tells people they welcome to community in and shoot pictures of the Eagles uh but we got to check in at the gate so that we know they came up we don't get a locked in there at night uh we're doing some Timber harvesting at the Prescot landfill acreage we did some of that last year uh it's been a little bit wet this year for him to get a start on that but last year we saw unexpected revenues of around $177,000 for the wood that they cut there looking for about that much again this year one other thing that we talked about and we're going to try a pilot project and it really is U it stands to show how well the four owner communities work together with a suggestion from the temporary town maner of limestone we looked into a pilot project would allow the towns uh to be able to utilize some of our space in the landfill for helping us get rid of lighted properties it be exclusive to the owner communities uh and we're doing it in a limited amount this year because our budget is already set in place we want to see how that works for the communities it's really just a benefit that we want to give back to the communities for their support for the landfill over the years uh it's not very often that we're able to do something like that but it's a benefit to the four owners uh which we really feel we should be doing remembering the fact that once the landfill is closed for 30 years after that's closed these four communities are responsible for that landfill so we should get benefits when we can uh in Allen's idea was a phenomenal good idea and it made a lot of sense for us to try it so it could grow into something bigger for us next year or the year after Mark mentioned it may open some possibilities for some grants for us to use that would allow us to bring other communities into that process as well so and there any other questions I might be able answer for you thank you very much thanks Ste and as uh as Steve alluded to in the uh in my memo I had also mentioned it we we've kind of earmarked or eyeballed at least one property in town that we're looking to try to um remediate through this program clearly there's there's more that we need to look at and um so hopefully we'll be able to utilize that to its full benefit there is no roll over currently uh as as constructed so we are kind of in a use it or L it situation so we want to make sure that we can take advantage of the of the opportunity we have at hand thank you Steve uh next up I've asked uh superintendent Staples to come in and provide us with an update on our schools she has so graciously agreed to while she's in the CL of her budget as well and has provided hand up to you folks soon thank you take thank you for inviting me to come here tonight um I did provide you with a handout of just a little bit of information I put together about the schools and kind of where we are now with some of our programming um and some things that are on the horizon for us I can absolutely relate to Bud budget season um we are deep into it right now so if we kind of go through um the handout that I provided our population Trends we are fortunate that we are still seeing a little bit of an increase in our population um through the covid years we saw a little bit of a decrease like everybody else did as people were kind of hunkering down and trying to figure out how to navigate all of that but um we saw an increase last year and we've seen another increase again this year which is a very good thing um you can see from looking at this um report that we are you know compared to some of our other neighboring schools we're still doing quite well and um if I Channel Mr do a little bit he always said we were a big small school and and it's it's true we really are when I and when I looked at these numbers that stood out um even more to me so we're we're solid with our enrollment which is really helpful um especially when it comes to our funding because the more enrollment we have the more funding we get from the state it all plays into that formula so that is a good thing um when we look at programming we've been able to add back some programming we've been really excited about that this year we had been without a world language for several years that we have not had that um we were fortunate to be able to hire a French teacher on for this school year and that has been very popular um we're excited about the direction that that's going and be able to expand that she's done some with Elementary School this year um middle school and high school next year we'll be expanding even further into the high school um it was a huge gap for us because were finding that students needed form language to go into college and we had an online program and not an in-person teacher and I'm not good at learning a foreign language on on an online program I need a person in front of me and so we recognize that need and we're fortunate that she came along um similarly we added music back in we had been without a music teacher for um a year and that is problematic because it really captures the population of our students that that is their outlet and I was that student when I was in school and um Mr Martin I credit him a lot with jumping on board even as a teacher seeing that need and partnering with me when I was in the principal position last year really trying to find someone and then bringing that into his role as a principal this year so we've been fortunate to get coral and instrumental back um and we're expanding those a little bit more for next year trying to get the kids instruments dug back out of their closets and um getting instrumental lessons back so that we can can get a full band back into place we're hoping that they'll be able to start with the band next year so we've been making good progress um after school enrichment programs at the elementary school have been a huge hit 3D printing is Big when you're a little kid they have been lining up there has been a wait list for Mr merch's 3D printing class after school and he so he had a basic one and he's expanded now into and more advanced one so he can have different levels of groups and they're making all kinds of cool things their project right now now has been making name plates for all of the doors for the teachers at the elementary school so they're making name plates on the 3D printers teachers get to pick their colors and kind of any special design they want the kids are actually making them with Mr merchison after school and it's it's been a huge thing for them so the enrichment programs have been um really helpful I think it helps with just some after school programming for kids and it exposes them to something different that they don't get to do every day we've added work experience at the high school um with through our jmg and we're trying to um promote that more and get more Community Partnerships into place with the goal of hopefully being able to expand that out um we've been fortunate to kind of tie into the melmat grant with that a little bit too we've had different business partners that have come in to speak with our students um telling them about their careers how they got where they are steps you might need to take um and it's not just been some have been fouryear College some have been you know vocational Community College some have been just going out into the workforce and how they got to where they are today so I think it's good to show kids a variety of avenues that they can take when they're working for their career and then we have our concurrent enrollment college classes still we've had those for a little bit but we do have a new partnership with umpy that we've been working on um through that and so we do chemistry and psychology kids can earn college credits before they graduate from high school gives them a little bit of an edge going into college a little less expense a few credits and the added benefit of you're doing it with a teacher that you feel comfortable with so it's teachers that they have at the Middle High School who are teaching those classes who know the kids have relationships already can really help them out with that especially for their first couple college classes that can be a little daunting when you're off on on your own by yourself so some of the programming that we have this year um on to Grants on our next page we've been hustling to get grants written um in my department my aen deam Kathy who's here with us tonight we've been writing a lot and really hunting down any way that we can to try to get some extra money to save in our budget to save in taxpayers Pockets down the road so we've been able to get a tuition reimbursement Grant um that that one helped to pay back for teachers so the district in their contract they pay a certain amount for teachers to take classes we were able to get that reimbursed to us this year for all new teachers which added up when we really did the numbers on that to 20,000 it's a pretty good number the literacy Grant is some of our curriculum material so we were able to take that out of our budget um we had a real need to update curriculum that's part of my dual role as the superintendent curriculum coordinator um we've that's been an area we've been focusing on for this year and we really needed resources so that literacy Grant helped tremendously $52,000 to be able to get curriculum materials that we don't have to pay for to the school budget is huge um the homeless student grant helps with any students who we may find in that predicament that we can have a little money to help that family out summer school program we're actually working on that currently and but we feel very hopeful there's a huge pot of money out there that the um this particular Grant they are trying to disperse and they're just looking for schools that are willing to take it and use it and so we have summer school anyway we need to fund that somehow this is a great opportunity to be able to get the Monies to fund that um and to expand it even possibly into our eighth grade Rising ninth graders to kind of Target some things there I'm working with pin's health on a dual partnership grant for substance use prevention that they reached out to me to see if um we would be willing to partner that was an absolute yes so we're working on that we've had the melmat grant that deals with college tours it helps us with senior events some of you might have been to our senior send off they all would get t-shirts and we would raffle off gift baskets and things so that all helped with that um and then the big one is gear up we had we were reached out to by the gear up folks we' had that Grant in the past they have over $4 million to share and they reached out to us to see if we would be interested and hopping back into that I don't turn down free money so it was a yes that's an easy yes and so we um are in that that's already been approved it's a seven-year Grant we're one of eight schools that will split that $4 million and we can use it for it will be scholarships for every senior for the next seven years will'll get a scholarship don't have to apply automatically goes into their account um college tours will be covered they will cover after school we believe after school tutoring costs they have in the past and they said that that would be something they think they would be able to do for us which would be paying teachers to be able to stay so we don't have to pay for that on our own and it benefits the kids some orientation costs professional development for teachers so that's a big one and it follows us for seven years they will actually tag into the seventh grade class that we have currently have and follow them all the way through postsecondary and they'll also tap into our current Juniors and seniors so um I think just for every senior to get a scholarship is is Big because everybody's looking for ways to help it's hard with families and it's hard to go to school and the cost of everything is rising as we all know so that was a huge benefit for our students so the budget process I just added in some I wasn't sure how much everybody knew about the budget process for schools so I thought this might be a good chance to just kind of share how we do that it starts in December um and we started with my building administrators and program directors work with their staffs to compile their budgets they get all the numbers given to them and they then send that off to me we try to tap it before February break so that I we have a chance to look at it we get our Ed 279 which is our state allocations and our local requir allocations in February so that comes mid to late February that we will get those first initial numbers based all off of enrollment in a fancy formula that I wish I could explain thoroughly but I have yet to have somebody be able to explain thoroughly to me even the program director at the doe has a hard time because it's just a it's a convoluted process but they put all the enrollment numbers in and it spits out for each school what the state allocation will be and what the required local numbers will be for budgeting so we take that and then at the end of February I met and Kathy met with all the administrators and program directors so they could share their goals and their needs for budgets especially if they had anything that was a significant increase over last year so we could understand why behind that in March we do all of our budget workshops we've had one we had our first one two weeks ago I believe it was with our board um and then we've had a school board meeting also that we discussed budget and we have another budget Workshop coming up on Monday so we try to do as many as much as that in March with the hope of being able to get all of our final numbers and we don't get final Insurance numbers till the end of March so we still don't have those yet to be able to really complete a budget we're kind of in the waiting mode to be able to get all of that um The Hope is we get all that in and then in April the board will be able to approve the final budget and then it goes in May to The District budget hearing and to a public vote um and we're aiming for Mid to mid to late may as that usually is for the school so that's a little bit about how it's it's a process but I find it's a valuable process it's really helped me to be able to to sit with all my administrators and I think it's been really good for our board and they've appreciated being able to hear the first budget Workshop is just the administrators presenting their why what we need why we need that why we're asking for this because you can make an educated decision on the importance so um through that process the board decides do we want to do we need to make Cuts they look at bottom lines give us some direction um we go back with their Direction in mind and look and see are there ways that we can make some cuts to bring this number down it's kind of the back and forth game for a little bit which I'm sure is similar to some of what you folks will do too um and so we're still in that back and forth right now we have we don't have anything solid yet I'm hoping to get a little more solid here by um Mid April so that we can can we can share a little more firm numbers and and talk to Mr go a little bit more about what that will look like too um so the next one is how is the school budget paid for we have our state and local allocations the state that's the numbers that they give us the local allocation is required if we don't get the local number we don't get the state funding so it kind of they go they are a package deal um we have revenues that come in like our tuition we have students that come from Limestone we actually have a couple students um from Caswell that have reached out with interest this year that would be tuition students and so I met with a superintendent actually this morning um from Limestone and Caswell and so we're going to be working on some contracts to get Caswell also brought in so that's um some extra revenue on that front we have state agency clients any carry forward um adult education is also a piece right now we did get that in it's locally paid but we did find out it's going to be a decrease which is good news our um Adult Ed cost so that will be passed on to taxpayers as well a little bit of a decrease is always nice to have so and then additional local and that's the number really we're working on in our budget workshops right now to determine how much we will need additionally on top of everything else that we have coming in you can see on the revenues page on the next side on the next slide um the funding allocations uh last year it was at 6.9 97 Mills this year the state has set it at 6.62 Mills for local the state sets a mill rate for every school in the state so every school has that Baseline mill rate for this year of 6.62 and then every school district needs to say okay what do I need additionally on top of this to function in those state and local they account for teachers they account for edex they account for a bus they account for admin costs they don't account or give any funding towards things like Athletics our electives teachers so French music those kinds of things supplies they don't account for Capital Improvements they don't account for curriculum or technology so all of that falls we get a little bit but a lot of it falls back on us to figure out how to fund that so you can kind of see some PR and what your local required will be um for this coming year Capital Improvement projects this district has done a really good job I can't take any credit for it um because it was prior to me coming um they had SRA funds covid funds that came in um and really did a great job in this District of looking at how to use that without having it be a detriment in the end so in other words we're not going to start paying all of our staff members out of Co funds or hire a ton of new people out of Co funds and then have to figure out how to pay for it later they looked Instead at projects and things that would have had to be done anyway and how can we use these Grant Monies to save our budget and save taxpayer money in the long run and when I looked at this bottom number to see it was over you know 1,400 1,400,000 over that in projects that was done with just that grant money over the last two to three years it's pretty huge um I'm not going to go through all the list because you all can read but there are projects on here that are projects like things that we those are large costs to schools um large cost to anything tiling north entrance pickup trucks for our clowing needs and school vehicles for our travel needs so they've done a great job with really allocating funds for that so that it's helped us knock a lot of things off our Capital Improvement list our buildings are aging um like anything else does I think that Fort Fairfield historically I've been with this District off and on for a lot of years started as a teacher here and I can say they do a great job with keeping buildings really up to dat the facilities look really well for their ages the grounds they do a tremendous job um but that's because of people that really have that oversight to be Forward Thinking of the projects and ways that they can get things done so we knocked out a lot of those projects over the last two to three years if you look at the next page you can see some of the future Capital Improvement movement plans that we have coming down the pike the ones in yellow are the ones we're going to tackle this year we need to replace our final fire panel replacement in the elementary school we need to do some kitchen pipes we still have a some lead cleanup things that we're trying to do with the kitchen pipes in both of the um schools that we need to do that Leach your repairs at the middle high school that they're just not working like they need to work and we need to make sure they're safe for all of our crowds that come to sit on them and boiler repair there I feel like every time I I I felt your pain a little bit I feel like every time I think we're making Headway something else breaks and we just kind of have a boiler issue that creped up on us last week actually um and so we're looking at trying to we're going to have to repair at least one but we're looking at cost and is it cheaper to repair or at we are we at the point where we need to replace and are there grants to be able to help fund that so we're waiting for somebody to come and do a um evaluation of that so we can get a little more information but you can see some of the other projects we have coming up um they're just you're running the M maintenance things that you need to do really to keep school so Paul pity and I we will be working this summer to come up with a really comprehensive list of capital Improvement um and do a strategic plan over the next three to five years so we can be thoughtful and plan ahead and not kind of find ourselves in these situations where we're being caught and um you know things are breaking before we've had a chance to to replace them and then we're hunting down money things that are included in the budget we wanted you to be able to see where some of our big costs come from and I clearly salary and benefits are the biggest costs to school budget um and these are based on bargaining agreements and contracts that are already in place they're not anything that's negotiable at this point um teachers and bus drivers just negotiated new car contracts and salary amounts last year for a three-year contract so those are what's locked in it includes benefit increase includes the new paid family medical leave um law that came into place um where you have to contribute at least 1% of an employee salary towards this Family Med paid family medical leave um supposed to kick into effect in January 2025 so we have to budget for it now because we have bargaining agreements and contracts that are in place we're being advised that the school needs to go ahead and plan to budget for the whole 1% and split with unions until those Union contracts come up which as I just said will be another two years before we renegotiate anything so we've had to budget an extra 1% in to cover that cost we don't have um Mr gof and I were just talking about this we don't they haven't done all the rules on that yet and so we're still waiting to see where that all lands it we've heard that the rules were coming out at the end of last year and then the start of this year and we still don't have any yet so we don't know all of what that's going to look like but we are budgeting accordingly um health insurance we're you know is is an increase we're still waiting to get that final number we budgeted 10 we're hoping we've budgeted 10 we're predicting it down to six but hoping for lower so but we're being conservative and to start with property insurance is a is an increase for us um our Capital Improvements we always try to leave some money in there for the things that just may come up and hit us on the field sometimes contracted cleaning services and the power Services were extremely short St we've not been fully staffed with custodial or bus drivers um we just have not been able to find custodians or bus drivers they've had one advertisement out for three to four years now for a bus driver and custodian and it's just goes unfilled so um we've had to contract so we're contracted first to help with our cleaning and to help clowing because we're trying not to burn out our people we have very dedicated folks that have some of them have been there for years who come in every day early late do whatever they need to do but you know you're always in the danger of burning somebody out and we really don't want to keep adding more to their plate so that's why we've looked at doing some Contract Services and then our normal um wood chips and heating fuel costs and our special purpose private school tuition so those are tuitions for students um that go to OTC um opportunity training center in in presy and those are some of the tuition rates for our students that go there for their schooling so those are already included in our budget for this coming year some of the major increases we're seeing and we're trying to work through in our budget workshops um again salaries and benefits not a lot that we can do there um we are bringing some things out of Esser and back in it's not because we hired them during covid it's because we wanted to be thoughtful and so we paid their salaries out of it to try to give a break to everybody for a few years but we need them we cannot do our jobs without our edex they are very valuable um asset to our schools and a necessary asset we have a large special education population and our Ed teexs are what help keep everything running smoothly um so we will need to keep those in we had a professional development increase we're going to be looking at ways that we can decrease that um it was nice having those extra funds we could say yes to everything you because it was grant money that was paying for it we're not in that predicament now to be able to say yes to everything and people are understanding of that so we're going to be looking at really scaling back that number um to get it to something that's a lot more reasonable computer equipment and software we had a little bit of an increase there we paid that um some of it out of Esser last year this year we'll have to bring that that number back in that's just our student computers and Licensing and things like that that we need every day just to do um our jobs this Contracting plowing is an increase um we have started with some of just doing the elementary school this year we're going to be expanding that into the middle high school plowing and that is like I talked about because we're just trying not to burn our folks out um cost of a bus went up a little bit since the last time we had to get a bus so $112,000 there we did a little bit of our maintenance supplies and repairs as you know just buying your groceries I'm sure everything has gone up in cost and so just like it's gone up in our grocery bills it's gone up in our school bills for buying supplies and materials um the two things that are really still in a l of conversation are the school resource officer our board asked us to um explore that option of adding a started with a full-time school resource officer um we are blessed that we have a very um great partnership with our local PD Chief Cummings um I've said this in many venues and I'll say it again he answers my calls so I'm thankful for him and he answers every time and so um we're trying to look at ways to explore how to have a deeper partnership with him in the schools um we don't think full-time will necessarily be able to happen but we're looking at some part-time possibly um and having some conversations about what that might look like to build some relationships with kids um get them into the elementary school and the middle high school obviously some preventative stuff would be good to have on hand too but our real focus is trying to just build relationships between police School Community kids parents and really try to um bolster that a little bit so we're still in a lot of conversations about that and those will continue in our next budget workshop and then Capital Improvement project we have an increase there of 153,000 because we're looking at an underground storage tank we're still doing a lot of conversations with that um and trying to nail down is that really a need this year to have to replace that or are we good we get an inspection the beginning of April that will hopefully pass and tell us that we can hold off for a minute on having to and put that in and that we really strongly believe we won't to but for right now it it's it's on the horizon just in case until we get that April inspection and then the last one I have with you is just some proposed budget cuts we're talking about we're looking at our hopefully predicting our health insurance is going to go down from that 10% um we've been looking to see how we can shift some folks around so we're going to try to move um edtech into some our local entitlement Grant like our special ed funding Grant guidance that Gear Up $4 million Grant is going to take a lot of the increase from there we're looking at our teachers rate their supplies when they put in their budget requests they rate them a one two or three one being I need this for my class room I have to have it and two being medium and three being more of a I call it the Christmas wish list um so we've kind of taken the twos and threes out we put an all call out to the teachers saying hey can you help us we have an increase and we want to get it down and they were wonderful everybody's really pulled together and said you could take this out you can take this out and so trying to help um you know get money down anywhere we can um couple capital projects that we're looking at taking out which is that fuel tank some metal roofs on the sheds um moving some things to our Title One Grant we have our Title One School the elementary um and then trying to go from full-time to entertaining the C the talk about a part-time school resource officer and that bus driver that we've been we have two openings and one of them has been just we've been holding on them forever so letting one of them go and taking that out of our budget um one of them we just are hiring somebody she hasn't got her bus driver's license yet so we have to train her up but we're working on that process and we have somebody who do the training inhouse so that helps but we're looking at taking one of the bus drivers out so it's kind of where we are in our schools and in our budget process if anybody has any questions for me that I haven't already spoken about okay thank you yeah thank you thank you very much superintendent St Lots going on up to the schools and it I I hate to commiserate but I certainly know the wages insurances and utility cost drivers uh very much so uh next item on the agenda is a request to move the June meeting date um as we set the town meeting schedule the third Wednesday of the month is when Town Council meetings occur um still try trying to get used to juneth being a holiday in the sense that I guess for some reason I thought it bounced around the the schedule but June 19th is Jun uh so therefore it's a conflict uh we would have uh staff overtime incurred if we kept the meeting on the 19th um my my recommendation or my request to council is that we move that meeting earlier by a week uh not later by week because it's likely uh to be the meeting that we would vote on the budget uh so uh hopefully you folks saw this this request and we can choose to move that and we will publicize that very well let folks know that we would be moving that to June 12 doesn't need a vote but just want to make sure that it seemed amendable to folks um it's on my radar now i i n was nice enough to bring it up to me say hey by the way are you aware nope I was looking at the budget so if that's acceptable by you you're the you got my blessing all right fantastic thank you uh item F the fort Fairfield revitalization project update uh councelor canavan had asked for a few moments of our time to to bring us up to speed and what those folks are doing so yeah P we haven't gone away we're still we're still there we kind of took winter off but um the little committee is still meeting and we met on March 2nd to talk about some of our plans for the summer um we're kind of excited we have a new member um Jess Babin and she very much wants to be the lead in establishing a farmers's market so she wants to get uh she's got quite a bit of Interest generated not just from the community but also from U possible vendors I know um there's a group of Amish people that are going to join and I know there's local people we've got some really talented people in town that do lots of neat stuff grow stuff make stuff so we want to make a nice little farmers market and I really want to make it just the start of something that can continue um I asked him if we use the the green space between Acadia and Kaden um it's kind of an unused piece of grass in town my concern is it's pretty rough um that it's not real level ground where it's been filled in so I don't want anybody to get hurt so I'm looking at there's a couple of Grants out there and I'm doing some research on more grants um possibility to get some funding maybe to get some improvement on getting the grass dug out maybe some gravel down so so that it's a little bit smoother and compacted um and safer for people and something to make the entrance noticeable um give us a chance to put up lights plants advertising banners whatever and make it maybe a presence in the middle of downtown that other people can enjoy for other events not just the farmers market Farmers Market will be held on Saturdays from like 8 to 1 every week through the summer um again beginning May 11th we've also talked about um some uh volunteers for a townwide cleanup putting together talking about putting together little kits that include Pickers garbage bags gloves safety vests and doing some getting some volunteer groups possibly to walk on some of the side streets and Roads and do some garbage pickup maybe in coordination with the the town when they do their cleanup day so bit some details and need some support from some of the Town um departments to do some of that but I think it's a pretty good idea we'll look for some volunteers and we'll look for some donations of pizza and snacks and stuff for whatever groups and I know there's students that sometimes need community service work so that might be a good project for them um we're working on a Flag Day event we're not exactly sure what we want to do we want to make sure that flags are being flown on Main Street and and we want to do some kind of a special event for Flag Day um and we're beginning to plan uh Friday in Fort our one of our first events we're not sure when it'll be but we're starting the planning thing we're talking about doing a flower Bridge you know the little Bridge down I don't know where the pumping station is that little Bridge we're talking about doing a flower bridge I'm not exactly sure what it's about but we've talked about it it sounds pretty interesting it's just a way to brighten up and liveen Main Street a little bit like to get some energy gener erated and some positive things happening your uh your last event Fridays and 4th that was a that was the best wasn't it yeah we'd like to be able to replicate that a few times yeah we might be talking to you problem okay so and and I've got quality of place too involved in some of this planning I've been talking to Phil Christensen we'll see what we get to just wanted to keep you guys informed we're still out there still plugging away well thank you for the update you're welcome yes in in April you got to tell us what a flower bridge is can't leave us can't leave us in suspense too long I I think it's just putting flowers all along the railings of the bridge but I'm not sure I don't know where you GNA get the flowers from not me mine don't last very long a couple weeks fantastic thank you coun welcome uh if it's okay with the chair I'll move along to Old business and uh underneath old business we did uh received two nominations uh for the 2024 forare K Spirit of America Foundation tribute uh for outstanding Community Service uh the the two nominations we received were Mike Greenlaw and Justin Hershey JJ's J&J's Redemption um I know that we had fored these names along to council and I believe uh rather than and vote on that or deliberate that Council was going to take those nominations under consideration and get back to us and then we would uh honor these folks in April so that remains your wish then I don't know if that needs to be tabled or if there's a motion on that at a minimum you need to table it it's not going to be any other action because it's on your business okay y on motion that we table this uh information to until our next meeting fantastic yeah second all in favor hi and we'll work on how we work that process out in the future I didn't realize I was going to trigger a vote when we said we had to vote on this in March so maybe we just gather the nominations in March and give them to you guys I realized it kind of after the fact I'm still learning on the job um Item B is the main housing annual Tiff report on The Meadows I've included the completed report in your packets uh it has not changed um there remain 25 units of exist affordable housing uh rentals for seniors um basically we just need Municipal approval for me to sign uh this report so we can get that onto Main housing for this year so entertain a entertain a motion give Tim the ability to sign second no I need a motion moved so moved okay yeah second all those in favor I hi oh sounds good finally got somebody to make a motion yeah no worries uh truck and R along into new business uh we've received a poll permit request from verson power for an energy upgrade that they're doing uh pretty close to the intersection of one uh 161 in green r Road uh Public Works director uh and Tony as well have both looked at this uh both of them said there's no issues that they see with this being allowed to be installed within the town's RightWay I will make a motion that we accept person Po's application for power pole replacement second that any questions or comments all those in favor I I fantastic Item B under new business municipal pool pumps at this point this becomes more of a piece of education but also maybe something for us to discuss uh so ultimately uh week and a half ago I got a call about water running out of the the pump room at the pool not a good call to receive uh because we quickly figured out that we had a water uh being break within the building um unfortunately it flooded uh the pumps to the pool which you would think pool pumps would be waterproof but again apparently they're not uh and they shouldn't be submerged for several hours uh we've been advised by the gentleman who has maintained the pool and actually designed uh the pool that they should be replaced um and his estimate uh and I have that attached was $110,000 um part of the challenge that we see here is that if we don't move forward sooner than later um if the pool if the puns cannot be repaired we will lose the season um so just this morning I received a phone call from a gentleman who just traveled down from basa they believe they can salvage these pumps they're going to take them apart uh service them and try to get them back to being functional if that is the case we won't need to order Replacements um but right now we just don't know um my concern is we need to pretty much have an answer in place by April 1 if these pumps are going to work to give us the six weeks lead time on the back order and the two weeks or so that we would need to have these scheduled for installation and to be up and running in time for the pool season um so my request to councel and certainly I'm happy to answer some questions is that we provide a conditional approval that if we cannot Salvage these pumps uh to give us the ability to use administrative reserves to replace these damage pumps because if not we will ultimately end up not having a pool this season and that would be tragic because so much of our pool so much of our summer W program revolves around the PO so certainly happy to answer any questions you folks might have there any questions do we have any idea from this in maasa how long he expects I I we would expect it to be fairly quick he's got to dry these pumps out kind of fix the corrosion in them get in there look at the bearings uh look at the electrical um his conversation with me on the phone kind of swayed me from replacement to repair because he said he was about 99% certain he could get them work and 99% is a chance that I was willing to take when the ultimate cost is about $10,000 um that we really just don't have budgeted um makes me less happy about all the interest I earned on our savings but I think it's not enough to cover the cost um but ultimately um he felt very confident that they could fix these and um I have had conversations with both Mr Hansen and with Mr helstrom at the water district uh that they have had pumps that have been submerged before that have been able to be salvaged um the pool pump install caller the pool expert is less less enthusiastic I guess about their ability to be repaired um I'm really hopeful that we'll have an answer within the next week or so because if we don't we're going to be in a situation where we're looking at delayed opening or Worse um which is why rather than try to convene a special meeting we just figured let's have the conversation now bring it to your attention and then see if there's any sort of um hope that we can just have these be repaired versus replaced so okay I make make a motion make a motion we follow your to recommendation okay any questions all those in favor I I'll be certain to report back we we have a department head meeting scheduled on the for for budgetary I'll be certain to have an update at that meeting that hopefully it won't require us to go into any sort of a special council meeting but just I'll give you guys an idea we're going to do the best we can to try to get get this back up and running but if uh worst comes to worst we having to bite the bullet um it's unfortunate uh next item item C under new business is the sale of eight pool Drive um as I alluded to in the packet uh the taxes on a cool Drive have been owed to the town of Fort bfield um since uh the tax year of 2017 2018 um the property went tax acquired in March 9th of 2021 um the town has boarded up the property and incurred the cost of kind of keeping it somewhat maintained at least mowing the grass a little bit and plowing it out a little bit um we have had multiple attempts to sell this property both through the bid process and um I believe at one point in time there was a contract drawn up that I found uh for $1 uh and the property just did not find the right buyer uh it has not gotten in any better shape um the raccoons seem to love it um but it's uh it's in they come from um there's two gentlemen as I as I mentioned in the memo Mr vender and Mr Smith who are renovating the property nearby asked to to look at the property and have made an offer to the town for $7,900 this more than uh pays for the costs of taxes owed uh and some fees we haven't we haven't assessed additional taxes since 2021 so it doesn't really make the town completely whole and it doesn't fix the issues of the cost of Windows and staff time to go in and out of the building um but we think it's a great opportunity to return the property to the tax rules and to ultimately see this property rehabilitated or a new structure put in place uh so we would um enthusiastically s Council to um transfer ownership of this property to the two gentleman's llc's as indicated in my memo sove a second any questions comments all those in favor enthusiastically yes uh it's great to see it go back on the taxs and we're very hopeful that this is just another piece of uh folks Taking Chances on distressed properties in town and trying to pump uh these light back into them uh item D is a is a add-on for basically the yesterday morning and this has come about fairly quickly um but it's a fair Fairly exciting opportunity um so former Town manager uh D Dan Foster his brother John Deb doll and our Librarians uh have been meeting uh the past oh three or four months about looking at a project to do um with some funding uh in memory of Beth feifer um and apparently uh the discussions had gone into you know some of the things that she enjoyed in community and a Children's Garden is one of the items items that they have decided uh that they'd like to seek to establish um the property at the library is difficult for gardening I I I think it's it presents challenges especially if the goal is organic gardening for food outcomes um there is some hope to put a small memorial garden on the library space uh in memory of Rose Elmer who passed in the fire on Riverside um this is completely unrelated um so Mr Foster and uh the the folks administering These funds on behalf of Miss Fifer have generously offered to pay for the entire project uh we're estimating the cost between 10 and $4,000 the location that we're looking at would be adjacent to what we would refer to as the barrel tree or the block house uh there's a old Foundation of a home that's been grass that has been basically underutilized for many many years the town maintains it um I do believe the snowmobile trail crosses it but it's really just to make a left turn to go towards the bridge uh the hope is to put some raised beds in this location some trellises fencing and a small reading Nook at the back of the of the parcel um ultimately future in embellishments or enhancements to it might be also include um a park over look in the river um so um because of the timing of the Season they're looking to get started on this project almost immediately um so I would uh seek the council to approve acceptance of these donations uh for this exciting new development on our Main Street any questions no but I'll make a motion that we uh accept the donations for the construction of a new Children's Garden motion any questions all those in favor I I the next item up for bids would be approval of the minutes of February 21st 2024 counc any questions all those in favor I and then uh coun chairo the warrants okay I entertain the Motions two motions for warrants number 15 in the amount $133,400 1,000 five4 41564 26 second any questions all those in favor I I any other other under other no other other for me sir okay public comment period three minutes okay one more motion motion that wej second second all those in favor I many thanks folks thank you",True

anything okay Tim floor is yours fantastic under correspondence and reports uh licenses and permits uh we do have a few items from the main do that came in uh via mail uh the Public Works director and I reviewed those today um just good work coming our way going to fix a bunch of Roads uh basically from the border through Main Street and uh towards caribou and parts of Pascal Street uh based on our um you know review of them we don't see any need to have extra Provisions put in place for uh anything based on the work that they're doing on these um so basically we just need Council approval to allow them to access certain uh Municipal roads during the construction season and we don't see any issues with the limited amount that they'll be using these roads uh we do think with the when it comes to a much larger project scheduled for next year uh we may have to do something differently but uh these ones present no issues so don't run away after the council meeting and we'll get your uh signatures on those three uh approvals and like I said ultimately good news for the town um under the financial report it's been an interesting uh last couple of months um just trying to understand the cash flow of the Town um and I'm very happy to say that the old tax anticipation note is no more paid off in full very early in January uh and we also no longer have the T tan for this year uh which was at one point about $675,000 so uh to remove that burden for the town is fantastic um doesn't remove all of the debt that the town is carrying but it still does put us in a better position moving forward um and as discussed and approved at a at a quick meeting that we had earlier in the um we have started to invest some of those excess funds that we have on hand while we wa to expend those uh and we've done so in a way that will vastly improve our return on interest uh I wish it was enough to offset any any bit of borrowing uh but with borrowing at 8% and investing at 5% even the banker and me knows that we're not going to get whole on that with that set up um but it's been good uh very busy in the town office as we get closer to the end of the the regular tax collection components so happy to answer any questions on that or on the doent realize I just could by pass that any questions fantastic uh next up to bat is our police chief who's got some items that he'd like to report on to you folks good evening counselors good evening all thank you for having me to give the report of the police Police Department um it's been a busy January February so far um we've dealt with about 350 total incidents that was the number on Monday uh since the 1 of January uh We've referred 34 of those incidents to criminal prosecution either by arrest or by summonsing to appear to court uh the incident so far we've dealt with several domestic violence arrests uh drug possession operating Under the Influence and several bail uh violence ation as you've seen of the press releases I've sent to you over the last uh couple months the guys have been pretty busy out there uh couple new things uh body camera Cruiser camera program uh we had discussed that a couple months ago uh we were able to uh fit that in this year we're currently in the implementation uh phase and we're looking to have the cameras installed and trained um by the company themselves mid-march couple um maintenance issues uh Public Works employee Chris gamlet assisted us with some much needed uh painting in the station last week did an excellent job I want to thank Chris and Public Works director Darren Hansen for uh lending Chris to us and always being uh willing to assist in cost-saving ways for maintenance and thanks for chief jalbert for patching up a couple holes there in the drywall we had uh it's nice to have our departments continuously uh helping each other out uh we've completed an audit purging of closed cases um inventory of our evidence room uh we're transitioning our evidence room to meet standards of the main law enforcement accreditation program in anticipation of attempting to become accredited uh this went well everything looks good we were able to get all the cash out of the evidence room after uh last meeting so that's a good feeling as well uh so tonight I've invited uh two of uh my employees here uh to present letters of accommodation uh for their effort while working for the police department I want to take a few minutes to read these letters uh present them to officers whippman and Fenderson uh these accommodations are just smart uh part of a small part of the good things our officers are doing on a daily basis so our continued goal is to enhance the quality of life for our residents and visitors uh these two accommodations are unique um in that um if I could have officer whippman and F here real just want to stand right over here so I've got two um different ones for for both of them for a couple different things we have going on right there um so the first one is is for both of them um so the these These are unique uh type situations it's a proactive enforcement um required to find these types of cases is difficult in itself when someone thinks of an oui or operating Under the Influence they generally relate that offense to alcohol but now over 90% of the impaired driving cases involve drugs such as methamphetamine fentanyl opiates prescription drugs and cannabis these cases require officers to recognize the clues of impairment of all these different substances then rely on a drug recognition expert to come in and conduct their test to see if officers findings are correct at the time uh by the time the drug recognition expert arrives the drugs may have worn off so the timing is of essence in these cases so the officers have recently received uh letters from uh um Mothers Against Drunk Driving which is an organization which promotes awareness and and um on U these types of cases um since starting with Fort Fairfield um in 2021 for officer whippman and 20 full-time for Fort Fairfield in 2022 for officer Fenderson um your commitment to enforcement of the laws of the state of Maine in the town of Fort Fairfield has been second to none your commitment to removing a pair drivers from our roadways making them a safer place for our community members friends loved ones and children is not g to notice in December of 2023 you received a letter of accommodation from Mothers Against Drunk Driving showing special appreciation for your efforts and reducing fatalities by focusing on this very important issue you have consistently shown your commitment to this by attending several trainings over the last year to better yourself and your service to your community for this I applaud and commend your efforts in making our streets and our beautiful Community a safer place for everyone who lives passes through and visits our wonderful town congratulations genten the second one for um for officer whippman during the afternoon of January 5 202 before you received a thirdhand complaint of animal cruelty at a residence on the Limestone Road in Fort Fairfield the third information uh the third hand information was quite vague but you immediately began investigating the crime with the information presented to you within 24 hours your investigation allowed you to draft and present a search warrant to a judge who deemed you had sufficient probable cost to search the residents upon searching the residents he located an animals who were malnourished abused starving and living in deplorable conditions the in investigation also revealed two deceased dogs the animals were immediately removed from these horrific conditions and proper care was given to save the lives of these eight animals without your immediate thorough and professional response to this complaint it is undoubtable that all these animals would have suffered horrific and tragic deaths your strong police work compassion and commitment to justice is admirable and I commend you for this congratulations work here Zoom smile Chief all right last but not least um officer Fenderson uh serves in a unique position um as a police officer here in Fort Fairfield not only as a police officer but he's a national registered paramedic which is proven quite valuable um for the residents of our community so this is for um he's been a police officer here since 2015 um in 2025 uh December 20205 you received a letter of commodation by then chief of police William Campbell for your life-saving efforts of a local resident since joining our Police Department full-time in October of 2022 you have used your dual roles and skills as a paramedic and as a police officer to enhance the safety and well-being of our residents you routinely first respond to Medical calls while on duty with the police department and without hesitation jump into the back of an ambulance to P perform lifesaving measures to people suffering from serious medical episodes you leave your police cruiser on scene and continue these measures in the ambulance until turning the patient over to the hospital staff on July 19 2023 while you were on duty at the police department a woman presented herself to the police station because she was not feeling well you immediately escorted her to the fire station and assisted the the on duty paramedic was settling her into the ambulance while doing this the patient went into cardiac arrest without hesitation you and the fire department staff began life-saving measures to which you continued until you arrived at the hospital and turned her over to hospital staff you undoubtedly saved this resident's life to which she has come to the station and expressed her gratitude for your actions that day on January 23 2024 while you were on duty at the police department you received a report of a woman who was deceased in the parking lot of local Health Clinic upon arrival you immediately assisted the on duty fire department crew with triage and it was determined that the patient had a pulse without hesitation you assisted in loading the patient into the ambulance and began p uh performing life-saving measures on this woman until the patient was stabilized and transported to the hospital your actions that day un undoubtedly saved this resident's life I applaud and commend you for your continued dedication life-saving efforts and commitment to the Safety and Security of the residents and visitors of the town of Fort Fairfield our community is fortunate to have you out there watching over them

that our officers are doing we often focus on the Bad and the media focuses on the bad so I'm here to present the good yeah thank you thank you thank you thank you Chief uh so next up on the agenda we have the an update on the main potato Blossom Festival but unfortunately um chery wer had a a family emergency so she was unable to to join us this evening I can tell you I have been working close clly with Cheryl on a lot of different facets of the festival as we try to wrap our brain around how best to manage and plan this event uh it is a it is an ongoing challenge it presents uh it takes a lot of uh planning it takes a lot of work to pull off the festival each and every year with about a hundred different events uh I can give you an update as to some of the items that she's been working on uh sponsorship have gone out rack cards are being posted throughout uh rest areas across the state um and travel uh centers um working on sponsorship and vendors um it's been it's been a process also the the lineup is mostly there um I will say that Cheryl's done a very good job this year of trying to get more people involved into trying to run the events so that they have some more ownership the events uh versus trying to be the festival director that oversees everything that goes on because it's just too much as a as a former director of the festival I can understand uniquely some of those challenges um so hopefully we'll get her back here another day to give you guys an update and then ultimately uh I do think it would be um worthwhile at some point in time I don't know if it's during the budget process or after uh to sit down and have a conversation not only with um Cheryl and myself but also with um other folks within the community um to basically work on how the bud uh how the festival is budgeted but also how the festival is planned and and managed moving forward it is one of those um questions that is always I I remember being the festival director asking the council not that any of you were the counselors at that time um you know what makes a successful Festival how do we Benchmark it what are we trying to accomplish and I how do how do we want this event to represent our community and our and draw visitors to our region and I think it's those sorts of questions that we need to address as a community that will also help us understand if this is the the right fit underneath the town's perview or if the town assists or at what level um it's definitely a big undertaking it wasn't always the town's responsibility to do um but at the same time I I I think most folks uh if not almost every single person in this community has an affinity for it um certainly I've heard from the few folks that leave town toward the because it's too busy um but um anyway I I do think it's something that we need to address at some point in time and and we'll work to find an appropriate date to have that conversation and work on it um but I do I do appreciate um you know Cheryl's willingness to step up and and help us out in this year because uh we were definitely up against it the the clock to try to get your bands booked and uh vendors in places difficult especially in a year where um there's other events going on head head with the festival um so that made an extra makes for an extra challenge so happy to answer any questions you folks might have related to that so and then I uh I do have an addition to the uh to the corresponden and reports I do apologize uh I had copy and pasted over January's uh agenda into February when I started working on it uh and in December we did not have an rustic waste uh Solutions meeting so therefore there wasn't an austic Solutions item on the agenda uh Steve reesi who is the town's representative on the board is and kind enough to to just bring us up to speed a little bit on what arusu Solutions is up to um I do think it's interesting that we it's in our community we should keep track so if if it's okay with you folks I'd ask St to to give us a brief update on what we met about in January and what we're looking at as the year progresses C even AWS met on January 26 we uh went over our finances and in for our first month and a half a year or so uh our expenses are 19% below what we expected so that's a good sign and our income is 15% above so we started on a good foot going forward um we took advantage of our Banker member and and uh we took a lot of our funds and redid our CDs to try to recoup some extra funding uh and he actually give us some good input on how to do that uh a better way so it'll save us a lot of money maybe bring us a little bit more in our expenses yeah safe the other thing we discussed in and probably they going to be asking some help from the town for field K presc livestone is to do an updated wage survey because we haven't done for quite a while and we want to keep things comparable through other municipality workers around and not to overshoot or undershoot so you should be something about that down the line and something that I find that's important to let you guys know about that you might not know about uh the main climate control Council targeting materials in in Material Handling um has asked Mark to be a member our our directed to be a member that doesn't sound like very much but there's a lot of federal dollars going into that uh climate control council stuff and if we're not there we're not going to have access to any of it uh and the fact that they ask Mark could be a member remember it just shows the importance that AWS has in the state standing we're the only uh Solid Waste municipal site that was asked to sit on next committing and Mark does that I think Mark would go we even told him not to he go anyway so uh we get a great guy there and he does great things and down the line when we ask you guys for some help to look for Marx replacement because he's given us his retirement notice in three or four years um we want to maintain those connections with the state of Maine somehow so I just wanted to pass that on to you and tell you that we're we're pretty pleased with Mark we doing that and it may open some doors for us anything else you can answer for you guys thank you very much thanks D Mark's always trying to look at ways to uh save money and or position us in a way to u to either extend the life of the of the landfill or find different ways to dispose of Le a might be you know the rain that falls on the trash that they've ultimately got a pump and so he's looking at some potentially Creative Solutions there as well that could save um you know less money or uh if in the future we didn't have the ability to just pump all of that off to a wastewater treatment plant what would we do so uh he does a lot of Forward Thinking out there it's a it's a much more complex operation uh than we need the eye um and and it has a tree full of eagles I mean how who is that it does who knew so who knew we're gonna we're going to start marketing that I don't know if you guys know that um next item up for bids is the uh budget work sessions calendar I uh have put forth a proposal for you folks uh basically uh I took the last three town managers approach to budgeting uh budget meetings I guess I should say um certainly not everybody's approach towards budgeting that would be a mistake um a certain manager approaches to budgeting maybe and uh ultimately looked at the time frame looked at the timelines and wanted to at least get on uh everybody's calendar uh a little bit of what we were proposing in terms of the actual physical meetings um I know counciler wette had reached out today with some other proposals uh with the budget advisory committee um we're on new to this process uh I'm not sure if I'm the one that needs to schedule their meetings or you guys meet in between these um my level of involvement what have you so um I just wanted to give you folks an idea of what dates and times worked for department heads so if there was a conflict in your schedules you could certainly get back to us um also wanted to kind of get it out there so the budget advisory committee could have get a copy but I wanted to give you guys first crack at it um so I I'm certainly happy to keep these dates if these dates work for you folks I didn't hear any conflicts um from anyone so these dates were you I'd like to put it to them and then if there's other places along the the schedule that you guys would like to fill in with other meetings certainly that's that's fine but I wanted to at least give us an idea of a time frame as to what we were looking at uh I will say uh March 22nd having the budget proposal available uh scary for me to pick a date it's a month from today uh and we may not have the school at that point so it may just be kind of a a loose collection of what we're what we're working on as department heads and as the town but I do want to get that into everybody's hands early because I'd love to put this behind us as quickly as we can this year and move on to working on other things um but clearly there's a process that we need to follow and we'll be working on this for many many months so um any input feedback uh any conflicts I do have uh one staff member that has a conflict on uh April 17th not mentioning any names but it's Nidra um but it's okay uh because it's our regularly scheduled council meeting so we have a contingency plan in place to take uh take notes and uh make sure she's covered for that day it's also my birthday so you guys are welcome to Brak K to cancel that day you ask um so any any I mean again certainly we can add to this as you guys see fit I just want to get you guys a breakdown of what we thought as it was a workable time frame and uh get it on um department heads calendars as well we all have busy lives and kids and different things going on so if it's good by you folks I'll put it out to the budget advisory committee and then if there's additions or changes uh we can go from there I solicit your input good okay all right fantastic we'll move forward with that we'll get that out to members of the budget advisory committee and we'll post it and we will start working from that schedule moving forward I have no old business no old business okay no sir so you want to move on to new business I'm happy to do so y don't worry to it so uh we had mentioned back in October uh the real need to replace the Public Works director vehicle and in doing so kind of the vehicles kind of trickle down uh through different staff members um we had looked at a few different vehicles and ultimately uh Mr Hansen found one on a government uh Surplus deals website uh with a number on it that seemed too good to be true for a vehicle that was in great shape uh and so uh ultimately Mr hon bid on that vehicle and was the lucky uh bidding uh winner uh so he and a staff member travel down to Massachusetts to pick up the vehicle and uh in bringing it back to the off and looking it over it is in fantastic shape we may have really hit gold on this one and it came with a lot of uh additional components to it um we would seek kind of um after the after the cart and with the horse uh your permission to make this purchase and thought we would have to go and sell this vehicle but uh it really was a deal that we just couldn't pass up it FS a massive need in our uh Fleet and it really does uh it will be a good addition for many years to come given its relatively limited usage um so uh we would seek your approval to finish this purchase and add the vlow to it that we F that reduce the cost of it and uh we'll put it on the road a motion we accept second yes Mr Go's uh recommendation that we approve the purchase of a pick second second any questions or discussions Darren I just I want to commend you real quick because I've never seen a GMC pickup with that many miles on it okay so any other further okay all those in favor hi hi and we appreciate you allowing us to kind of retroactively seek approval on this one it is a tough position to be in an aiding war and you got strike we we really uh this was the last we kind of Mr Hansen and I kind of set a a price that we didn't want to cross uh and uh to be honest it was right at that threshold and we got very lucky I think on this one we got a good deal so um it really should uh fill avoid uh so to the other end of the spectrum as it relates to Public Works and Parks and Rec Department um as the four of you are fully aware and and certainly members of the budget advisory committee are um the town of Fort Fairfield have purchased a 2019 Ranger 900 XP side by side with a snowblower and a set of tracks and a plow and while at the time the thought behind it was that it would be useful as a vehicle to plow the uh ice skating rink and it be used as a backup to plowing and clean sidewalks it it really just isn't the right fit for the town's needs um it has very limited miles on it I believe 600 miles potentially it's it has very limited usage um it's really in great shape but it doesn't fit our needs and so what we ask the council is um it to prove us going to a direct sale on this uh We've priced out what a commensurate uh vehicle would be worth we believe this is a a fairly good price it will be a good deal for whomever purchases it but also makes us whole and gives us the opportunity to then turn this into a new track list um and part of the the pitch that we uh put forth as as this process came and unfolded is that realistically we would be able to clear sidewalks more efficiently with a backup machine um which is also helping the residents of forare field where their health safety and wellbeing so it's not far out of the purview of the r to want clear sidewalks um realistically what we would do is we would use those excess any of those funds that we can generate from the sale for the purchase of a track list and any excess fund will go back to the rec department um and they have some equipment needs that we would like to address with those funds so uh we would ask your approval to sell this vehicle on the marketplace and see what we get for bids but it it certainly is a a piece of equipment that truly doesn't need a need for the community and we can do something we could turn it into something useful I so move that we a motion that we uh approve the sale of the UTV motion second any questions or discussions I think we got a guy in the audience that might want to by it all those in favor I I fantastic that uh concludes my uh my involvement here very good uh entertain a motion to approve the minutes from uh the January 23rd council meeting and also the minutes of the February 5th 2024 special council meeting I motion we accept the January 23rd council meeting minutes and the February 5th coune okay motion second second any questions all those in favor I I I entertain another motion for warrants number three or warrants number 13 and 14 number 13 being the amount of $11,340 5 and warrant number 14 and the amount is $6595 49 come motion oh God okay I'll motion um that we approve the warrants number 13 and number 14 okay motion second any questions just to mention that the last amount the number 14 is also putting money aside some of that is funds put aside for in the CD funds oh okay yeah CD right the 300,000 yes sir okay motion second all those in favor I I I any other no I have no other other okay uh last public comment period if anybody has anything I Y find it now I

Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible Li Justice Ro public comment period floor is open okay Tim excellent under correspondence and reports uh there are no licenses or permits to uh speak about so we'll skip right ahead to the financial report uh December was a a month of highs and lows uh the low point was having to dip into our tan to the tune of about $675,000 uh still slightly below budgeted projections of about a $700,000 usage uh but given the interest rates of the uh the day at 5.98% uh the interim cost of that or the short-term borrowing costs of utilizing the tan uh come out to the air at about $112 today uh so certainly something that we want to get away from usage uh and so I will pause uh reading for my script and just say so on the breaking news side um you clearly with February 2nd being uh when we see the bulk of our Revenue roll in from taxes uh we have paid that 10 down 150,000 as of last week an additional 300,000 as of today so we only have about 125,000 outstanding um so trying to get rid of that as fast as we can a good chance that we'll have that wi down by the end of this week uh we just don't want to leave ourselves short on cash but at the same time even if we did we could always borrow it back because there's about 325,000 that we didn't touch and T in um so anyway that uh paying off the 10 uh just saves us a tremendous amount of Interest monthly so it's nice to get that taken care of bright spots um Betty reimburse came in about 20,000 more than projected uh not a windfall that we're going to get used to was about equipment in the solar installation that had not yet been installed um continuing to dig into the uh the the budgets as we head into the um you know the more expensive part of the season when it comes to Heating and electricity um overall um below budgeted uh at the turn of the year so looking good uh and tax collections have been good and we are a little bit ahead on Revenue sharing from the state that is my financial report for December update uh in terms of the uh Town Council budget advisory committee site visits uh this is something new this year um it isn't a direct result of the community involvement uh but it's it's kind of a hybrid it's kind of come out of those conversations with folks um you know in learning this job I'm three and a half months in on on the gig now um ultimately it's been eye opening for me to go and meet with our department heads see the facilities understand what the town does for operations and so ultimately as part of this process I've I've uh engaged our department heads um to invite members of the council members of the budget advisor committee and ultimately because it's a public U public open to public meeting access members of the public to uh basically come on a tour of facilities with us uh so we're looking to do that at 5:30 on Monday February 5th we would congregate here in the council chambers uh probably start our process just walking through the building here since our Sho should all be dry um basically this is not an ADA Compliant uh tour we will be going up and down stairs uh should members of the public want to join in uh in least to observe um you know we certainly can make Provisions to get them in and out of the other exits within the building um key for us is just making sure folks are dressed for whether they're going in and that side of the building understanding we're not going to provide transportation over to Public Works of the library but maybe we can carpool with some folks uh realistically the goal is uh to have you folks and the members of the budget advisory commune to get a chance to go and see these facilities talk with the department heads and staff um and ask some questions again the public is welcome to attend um but in like a normal council meeting or Workshop um there really isn't a public comment period there isn't an ability for back and forth um so I think on a limited level you know hey is that an excavator you know I think they're natural conversation but in terms of like real heavy questions for the department heads we'll we'll funnel those through me and we'll answer those publicly um just to keep it from being more conversome than it already is going to be um so ultimately that's what we're going to try to do uh I anticipate that this will become more of an orientation for new council members and new budget advisory committee members in future years but where we haven't done this before um fig we do it all at once and like I said it is open to to the public to participate so um my recommendation is the council chairman sets that as the the date and time February 5th at 5:30 yeah February 5th good for you guys entertain a motion to a motion that we accept that that date and time okay second it second any questions all those in favor I I appreciate you guys uh willingness and participation we put the invitation out to members of the budget advisor committee as well we said we'll meet here on Monday at 5:30 and we'll go for uh we'll go walk about so excellent thank you um the next item under correspondence and reports is the spirit of America nominations the town of forth ffield has historically uh participated in the uh spirit of America Foundation tribute for outstanding community service um so the council is encouraged to formulate its own criteria to select and honor the recipient um with that person being uh recognized at the Town council meeting in April which is National volunteer month um last year 185 municipalities uh pick Spirit of America winners um I did give a link to the website um basically it's up to you folks if you'd like to establish a process or nominate folks for this or seek nominations um we'd be happy to to help recognize them in April so that's for outstanding citizens or yeah I I want to say a couple years ago not to you know Pat myself in the back too hard but the quality Place council is one of the groups that was recognized believe other individuals um it really is a uh I've read into this um this is kind of a main based organization that really sought to to um jump on the ideals of um celebrating Public Service um celebrating Community Spirit across me um so um it's really just a small group of folks that kind of run this uh out of the Southern heart and they they C uh kind of congregate that all together into a website and make sure folks are recognize for the good works they're doing in their communities so whether it's an individual or an organization there's one one award winner per Town yes that is the yep so um and and I apologize I I searched but I did not find whom it was last year so I don't know if there was a gas but I know that there had been in previous years and and I believe based on the email that I received from the gentleman Mr flare um there was a nominee but I could not in my records find that from last year but there's a few things going on right on that time frame so um so again however the council would like to seek nominations if they want to have folks email the town office or call us um certainly we could aggregate those for you folks have that maybe in the March meeting with a list of nominees or if few folks have Hol to to nominate you said quality Place Council got an award 21 I think is the year but it was also right around Christmas time so I don't know if the timing of these things have changed a little bit and gotten more uniform as this program is grown do we have any idea who nominated or who how how that came about no clue I got a phone call I said can you show up the town office and I showed off they said hey here's an award and I add my picture over there yeah I I really don't know enough about the process I didn't know much about Spirit of America to be honest I when I first got the email I'm like what is this about um so that's why I added the website um it really is kind of born out of a desire from under Governor leage to um seek out and honor more folks that are involved in their communities and kind of grow into this this organization so maybe maybe it'd be a good idea to have Mr Des Shan get that in the newspaper and then we could have correspondents back to the town office and yeah abely we could go from there and we could put a call out for nominees as well on like the town Facebook page and maybe c those together Forks if that that makes sense yeah and with it being January um you know getting the word out there now hopefully we should have a few nominees folks to select from in March yeah okay I'll put a note on here for myself perfect excent uh and one other just awareness piece uh main municial Association runs a photo contest every year uh they select 52 winning photos from communities throughout the state that ultimately uh this year will be made into a deck of cards for attendees at MMA um no no major prize winnings for the photographers selected uh though any any community that has a submission uh put in has a chance to go to the annual MMA connect mention for free so there is a financial inative potentially um so uh just wanted to put it out there that there's seeking submissions they can be emailed to main Municipal um I do believe it has an April 1st deadline for submissions that's no joke yeah no joke yeah I did not write that pun um as bad as a dad joke guy as I am with the kids so um certainly could also email the town clerk we'd be happy to pick a submission or two so and we'll put that out on the town's Facebook page but just want to make folks aware some of these things that are out there and things that we participate in so excellent uh under old business there is none um so moving ahead to new business uh we'll get ready to work here um so item a is a police seizure Camp um in talking with Chief Cummings um you know we've come to the the realization that it's probably not best practice to house everything that the police sees in the police um storage locker the evidence room um more and more frequently uh our local police are you know invol as part of their investigations are seizing cash and having that cash just setting on a on a shelf probably is not the best U idea so we sought out some best practices and had come across the idea that it would be better to put it in a federally inserted uh financial institution uh have dual control which would be the police chief and the town manager to just set these sides up funds aside rather than having them sit in a in an Evidence Locker uh the town would be liable for these funds should someone G an entry to the police department and take them or or you know something happened to those funds so um in discussing with him we wrote up some uh language that we would proposed to add to the police um Police Department's policy 2-5 property and evidence control and uh just need your permission as counselors to get the police chief myself the ability to put funds in this account funds in this account would only be funds seized they would be given back to folks if when a case is you know prosecuted or if the funds are due back to the person um you know we would make those U those return of of property um and any interest earn would put into the general operating of the town so a motion that we uh go by Mr Go's suggestion I think it's be very wise second that any questions or comments all those in favor I I Item B in grial par survey work uh as outlined in my memo to council uh I've been up to the industrial park on chaining girl several times uh since coming on board and actually a few times even before I became Town manager and one of the challenges that we're having a there is that you've had a lot of changing of hands of property uh since the decommissioning of reenergy the commissioning of a solar project uh some some uh pieces of that parcel looking to be um transferred into the ownership of Capel and other folks um and one of the challenges that we have right now is we don't have a well- defined boundary of those Parcels uh and a better understanding of some of the easements on those Parcels um we do have funds in an industrial park reserve account that I feel that we should hire a surveyor with those funds uh get those properties in better shape to then be either leased sold put back into development um because right now if someone came to me and said hey I'd like to to buy this parcel or build a building on it um I think we'd have to have the survey work done and surveyors are in short supply so the lead time becomes longer we're really shovel ready in that Industrial Park um my preference would be that that any cost associated with the survey work be attached to any conveyance of that parcel which the town would later recoup when that development occurs um it just help us clean that up a little bit and make it more sh ready is goal I entertain a mo I entertain a motion to allow Tim and the to go ahead and put the survey cheny girl move second any questions okay all those in favor I I excellent thank you uh for Fairfield Housing Authority reached out to the town clerk and has asked for the council's approval to appoint Nancy laaser to the Housing Authority Board of Commissioners uh she would be filling suzan tant's term that ends June 30 of 2027 the wishes of the council entertain a motion for Nancy Lasser Move Motion second second any questions all those in favor I and finally item D under new business uh the town manager is going to be the Grinch here a little bit but um one of the ways that we attract and retain talent in the town is being competitive in the labor market we do this through a variety ways it's benefits it's pay uh it's Flex scheduling it's uh being able to work from home based on the different departments and and job duties um but one of these items that that we came across this year is is to me a little bit egregious uh the town provides a paid holiday on Christmas Eve um I surveyed local communities and actually went dig in through mtc's uh town and Municipal Managers Association I can find only one in thisal in the entire state of M otherland for Fairfield that gets Christmas Eve off I don't want to see where that is because then people will be likely to move there but um it's just my belief that we incur a significant amount of overtime uh and ultimately close the town office it's it's really kind of a bad combination and and we could have even more overtime with bad weather um I do you want to note that this change should the council remove Christmas Eve from the paid holiday uh policy uh would exempt uh unionized employees because this is a bargain benefit um so we'd have to revisit that a future during negotiations so it's like every town employee wouldn't have this benefit um removed there are some folks that is part of their contract and we we'll honor that um but I do believe that Adam minimum we should um remove Christmas Eve as a paid holiday uh I I would leave it truly and I I didn't put this through in my notes truly it's up to the council if you wanted to Institute a a floating holiday which had no acral no payout it didn't close the town office that would be more than generous um but I could also just see us eliminating this this holiday we currently the town of for ffield has 14 paid holidays uh with one other nice perk one being the day after Thanksgiving um I'm not suggesting we get rid of that one because that's my favorite day off of the year um but that's maybe why maybe I'm not as popular in the town office these days but I do believe that the uh the Christmas Eve holidays it's just an extra added cost I guess is really the word I was looking if we move forward the we're still have a town Clark next meeting well I I I've explained it to to St I actually was going to take it away this year or last year U but I only came on board in October and I was looking to take it away in November and uh I don't think that was really the best move but taking the day after things a Christmas for the day before Christmas that fell on a Sunday just felt a little but it's in the policy yeah it's it's it's I understand the the wanting to be generous but the added cost at that is substantial 60 hours of overtime at a minimum potentially more if we had a snowstorm yeah again if if you're mov into a floating holiday there's no overtime cost staff can pick the the time that they wanted as a as a perk and ultimately the town office remains open another day of year probably at a reduced hour Christmas Eve we probably close at 1 o00 anyway um but yeah I I struggled with that one that was so again maybe not the most popular managerial move but when we're looking at budget items and cost issues this one rose to my attention because it's it carries a slightly significant fiscal yeah I entertain a motion to eliminate the Christmas Eve as a paid holiday and oh yeah I'll entertain that motion the motion no no I'll entertain one yeah move that motion okay second okay do we want to do with the floating holiday like per Tim's recommendation if it's not C that's anything yeah you foolish not yeah okay yeah and we'll write that into the town policy it's a nonacral non-paid out non rolled over it's user yeah time okay more than generous and I appreciate that thank you because you'll save my I'll be more popular when I walk into the count office tomorrow but I I do think that's a much better route very generous and a much better way of doing the thing okay yeah so we had a motion in a second so we got to go to vote Jim Shane I vote I for that oh I I didn't hear the question was the motion amended to also enable a payal I guess and it's that piece of it I I didn't hear it and I apologize I think they fixed it on the own perfect first by me sir we'll move forward back in your hands for minut okay uh entertain a motion for the minutes of the January 2nd 2024 special council meeting in the minutes of January 9th 2024 budget goals Workshop accept minutes okay motion second any questions all those in favor I I okay entertain another motion for warrants number 11 for the amount of 293 , 32521 and warrant number 12 for the amount of$ 39151 1944 okay all any questions okay all those in favor I I any other other no sir pretty straightforward this evening okay uh is open for our last public comment period of the evening any questions or concerns and we'll get Mr reesi back in front of us next month The Rustic way Solutions board hasn't met since early de what late December late November so we meet again on Friday so just if anybody's wondering why there was no update just the timing of the yep very good a motion that we go to executive session okay for MSR 4056 C Economic Development s okay got a motion in a second all those in favor I I thanks sorry we need a motion to come out of okay okay all those in favor I I

period but yeah yeah if nobody has anything then we can I oh yeah go ahead Tom Tom toll for Fairfield um two things i' like to thank Robert kill Collins for all his years that he was here on the council I know he missed that last meeting um I was hoping that I would have him at this meeting be able to thank him personally I did thank him at the shop um but anybody who runs for public office puts their time in it's quite a commitment and uh it's a lot of responsibility I think Robert did a great job under the circumstances and I want to welcome Shane on as a counselor again I guess his first meeting second meeting I wish you the best of luck and uh carry on thanks thank you I think the person you you mentioned last week the reserve account is something we should be discussing Yeah Yeah Tim kind of Tim kind of touch base on that too in his emails uh yeah and and I I did read through your budgetary goals I provided some of the ones that I'm looking at um I I think not having gone through the budget process before and being three months into this job it's it's uh it's a bit like drinking through the fire hose it's a little overwhelming in terms of trying to gather all the the financial information um plus all the just the different duties that a town has to perform uh so it's really been a a very steep learning curve um I think the piece of information that that really kind of set me back more more than I had intended or at least kind of surprised me and it was a bit of a w up call was just looking at our turn current debt uh situation and actually that's what I was working on uh kind of trying to get to the bottom of some of those numbers uh I apologize that I don't have this typed up uh I'll try to add it into our uh into our financial report um but I think it's important to understand that and I don't want to be a pessimist and and and I feel like sometimes folks think maybe I'm a little more pessimist than it should be I'm a realist and I and I want to make sure that we understand that a lot of good things were done in the past year to get us out of a really bad financial situation but we're not out of the W I kind of the analogy I would put is that you know we stopped the bleeding but the patient still in the hospital and and we've got triage to continue to do in this process um so I did an accounting of our current debts in our current savings um our current debts are as follows our short-term debt is $675,000 that's in a tax anticipation note so if we hear the word tan over and over tax anticipation note I would like in a tax anticipation note a little bit to a payday loan um you're spending money before you receive it money that's due to you you're going to collect it but unfortunately it comes at a cost uh currently the tan uh interest because interest rates are highs cost us $12 a day uh yeah ex exactly it's kind of nauseating um and I just I just gathered that detail uh a few minutes ago um in terms of other long-term debt uh we currently have 825,000 in long-term debt from time trust uh that equals an $8,300 monthly debt payment that we are tied to for another 10 years wow um and that is from startup costs basically of the ambulance service and other items that were spent I I can't and we can't undo what was done but we also have to realize that that's going to hang over our heads for 10 more years at a rate of like 4% uh which 3.8% great we could go refinance it today and make it higher so I guess it's a it's a relatively good rate um but is still grotesque in the sense that we can't cancel that um we certainly could pay it faster and try to cancel it sooner um but it's still there um the other outstanding debt uh is at about 4% rate as well um it's for this Municipal Building ex uh expansion that was done uh was taken out in 2007 it will retire in 2027 um and the outstanding balance on that is about $150,000 I would beg everybody on the planet not to hold me to that being the final total but based on my meth it's 150 or 200,000 they don't quite give you a breakdown from the municipal Bond Bank like you would get on a car loan that says here's your here's your principal balance it's pretty much just here's what you ow in interest and here's the monthly here's the big payment um my belief is that that's about 150,000 uh so we have $51,000 payment due yearly every year for three more years um so that's our long-term debt our long-term debt adds up to about 97 5,000 um I'll go to the next other piece of information which is the part that really is is is disappointing our current savings is zero you know that's where we sit um so when we look at uh when we look at reserves and part of the conversation I've had with you folks is trying to understand how we can take money from Reserve accounts that don't have money and then somehow doesn't appear in our budget it's really difficult to track our true expenses we don't spend a lot from those Reserve accounts because one we know there's no funds there and two um I think our department heads are doing a really good job of maintaining their expenses um but it leads to the other issue that really hasn't been addressed in many many years and that's capital investment repairs and improvements um our Public Works newest vehicle is a 2007 that they're driving as a as a plow truck that's that's not good um those have only gotten more expensive uh if we were looking at a new Wheeler right now dual axle plow trucks going to set us back somewhere in the area of $300,000 fully outfitted based on our current estimates we could use two of them not one we need a loader we might be looking at at chain you no better than I do $400,000 potentially 380 two two probably two okay I mean so it's not cheap you know it's you might have a good used one yeah fair enough right um well and that's a part of the problem that we're going to deal with from the pandemic still holds over is your used equipment prices are through the roof and your your scarcity um so I think realistically when I sat down to create budgetary goals for the for the tener of this meeting I really wanted to look at what what are we missing we're missing a big picture of of we've got still a pretty heavy weight of debt on us um and we have all this deferred maintenance all these deferred investments in equipment people buildings infrastructure um and that leads to why I've request the councel the budget advisor committee and we'll invite the public to to come in and see facilities because um I had a contractor in today we're looking at single pain window from 1950 with brass locks that have have broken off them that we need to repair we're just shooting heat out this building um we have some serious deficiencies in in facilities and on the flip side we're very lucky we're very blessed we have some very nice facilities we've got to work to repair and maintain them um and I think that's a big part of what I want to impose upon council at least just an understanding of what has been a very ey opening three months for me as a citizen turn Town manager um so creating a capital Improvement plan we're starting that process I I met with all department heads yesterday uh and we've created basically what I've been calling wish lists you know what do you what do you need so we can prioritize those and seek outside funding as best we can um so that's what we're in the process of doing now at a minimum the exercise is helpful so we can say okay if we did have X number of dollars we could put it towards a window or door or overhead door or a foundation that's failing or a roof that's failing um the list is extensive um and it's and it's it's um it's going to be expensive and if we can find Outside help great um but I think we have to look through this budgetary process long term and say we can't just continue to to not save for expenses that we know we're already going to incur um or we just have to give up some of these facilities and and I don't think anybody wants to do that either um in terms of of of creating reserves um it's it's going to be tough to do um but we need to do it we at one point our Public Works had a million doll Reserve just for that single Department enough to pay for its trucks without borrowing and without uh dipping into the actual um operating budget of that department um we're looking at a Paving schedule right now of every 39 years repaving our roads uh we need to get to six miles a year to do that we're looking at an expenditure well in excessive I don't know again I defer to the contractor and sitting at the table but I I figured without looking at numbers and actually talking there I'm figuring 400,000 a year I would guess that um that would have been the number I was going to put out there we just spent 140 to do two miles so that's that's probably about right you know um of course we're attacking the worst sections so it costs more um but you know we bought a patch a second patch wagon this year folks because we are constantly patching we're constantly patching um while while we're on that subject real quick yeah anything I don't want to leave this conversation I just I want to at least set the groundwork for where my my understanding where we're at yeah out out in the wild out in the wild west Tom's out there too but lot of trouble lot and I don't I don't want a single daring not by any means but this this has been neglected for a very long time but the roads you look at the roads the roads Crown this way and then the ditches down in like this yes so there's nowhere for the water to go so if we could get the water off the road I mean that would be that' be a big start and then you have your shoulder right up to your pavement yes that would be a big start to save conserve pavement that we do have the second patch wagon so that they could hatch faster to itching yeah yeah I mean they're acutely aware it part of it's also you got to have the staff to do it yeah I mean they've only gotten to folks staff as of November yeah um you know I had I had a citizen call today concerned about Road plowing because it was bad last year you know I can't predict tomorrow's weather I think it's going to stink I don't really want to be out in it but I also can't say that your Road's going to be absolutely clear you know when it's time for you to work shift um but at least we're crewed out yeah you know we're ready to tackle it um yeah it's it's a big challenge I don't I don't think that's lost on anybody yeah Keith and I think that was part of the the process de and asked uh you know could we pick up a second patch wagon because it would help them get more done so then they could then attack the ditching yeah you know they had some left over in their Paving but I said yeah yeah you know let's do it because one the one you have is falling apart and two if you could put two Creos out there maybe we can get the rows in shape where we can actually do the the preventative maintenance rather than just the yeah the emergency repairs again kind of back to triage we're reparing things as they come but we're not play planning to repair them on the schedule they need to be replaced yeah same comes with equipment so um you know it's it's it's kind of a start picture I don't want to be an alarmist I don't want to be overly Rosy in my you know I'm optimised we can get through it um it's a good town good Community good people and we we with planning can get there but it's kind of be painful I don't think there's any way around it and that's that's the part that SS because you know the mistakes of the past we're we're going to continue to pay for those as outlined in the beginning of my remarks for years if not a decade to come yeah I agree with that yeah you know I know the camera's to my back so can't see the face I just made but look it's it's so anyway um if if I can I'll just one other piece the the budget drivers unfortunately all uh for the most part point up uh the six-man count tax bills an extra 55 60,000 we're going to have to find we don't even know that number uh Co funding sources are drying up not just for municipalities but also the schools so we'll see some school cost shifting back from covid to to the municipality um we we're looking at a potential reduce the reduction in excise tax revenue especially because uh we have one uh local business that will no longer be registering trailers here as as somebody retires nothing we really have control over but it's coming uh lingering inflation which is definitely um pushed our wage pressure uh through the roof um I've been doing wage surveys with other Town managers throughout the region uh for multiple different departments just to understand where we're lying on that scale uh and we hope to have some numbers to to present to you guys as we go into the budget cycle looking at where we fall um Road repairs schools and uh and of course utilities yes sir J one other thing I want to just mention too is uh is the the comp claims that we have out right now I don't know if where we're at how many how many know we're going to be paying on but uh uh we'll have to pay that back I mean when I I had C things on me when I when I own ppal and uh I had to pay back uh you know a couple $1,000 a couple times on comps because the way that works is when that employees back to work that amount all factored in to what was paid out and your the the your premium is GNA go up for three years till that gets paid back so that's going to be pretty sizable expense I'm thinking yeah and and none of it unfortunately was preventable you know that's the that's the that's the hard part of it yeah no I I I fully agree that as part of the reason we're going to look back into the MMA uh risk pools we've gotten away from that in years past because of cost uh in my understanding is one of those drivers was related to comp insurance um but there's other benefits that come from mma's risk pools we we participate in their unemployment one uh at a minimal cost um there's some other ways that they can maybe assist us and and then even if the cost might be slightly higher there's other grants that they provide through that process that may ultimately make that net cost less so we're going to have to look at that I I've only recently started to scratch the surface on that conversation um we did change insurers this year uh to reduce the cost of insurance for the town um I'm actually been in the process of writing a sexual abuse and molestation policy for the last two months it's actually rolling out today well tomorrow to all staff today uh the clerk received it for town office staff um part part of what they're mandating we have to have these things driver logs and uh they're pretty unhappy with the lack of smoke detectors and the sprinkler system in this is you know this new part of the building um it's on our list it's on our radar but we can't commit to just you putting a $70,000 fix in place right now and they understand that but it's all that stuff drives your budget guys and like I said I wish I I had wish I had the rosiest picture to paint I I just I just want to make sure folks expectations are tempered realizing that it felt good to get out from under some of that old debt uh and it was great the other day I paid off the old tan I loved it I love no offense I love calling katat up and saying pay that to zero and send me the cancel policy you know no I I it's it always feels good paying off a loan I don't care who you are um so it's nice to get that $500,000 off our but that's a carryover from two years ago's t that's just crazy so we really are we're still in the digging out phase and it's it's just I want to make sure that that you know I don't want to set the tone of negativity but I just you know I'm realistic I work in a bank I I understand numbers um I may not understand Municipal numbers all the time I'm I'm trying awful hard guys U but I'll tell you what it's it's been eye openening and I know we're working the right way with the right people to do it it's just it's gonna take a while and it it's gonna because we've went so far off the rails it's frustrating I'm D punching things getting mad over it but I hope um but the I I can't I don't know file cabinets aren't safe sometimes when you find out just how en courageous some of our past decision making was and I'll leave it at that so I'm open to you guys the discussion I don't really know what we're supposed to do in this meeting but that's what I'm seeing from my seat and it's there's a lot and and I do look forward to taking you folks the budget advisor committee and and the town people that want to join us uh through our departments uh there's a lot of proud people that work here that work really hard um we do take a lot of pride in our equipment and our in our spaces but there's some deficiencies and we need you to see them firsthand um and I've showed some of you the the rain inside of the the Public Works garage I mean there's just some things that we've got to look to fix um and and we need to to have a plan in place and right now they I can't see one so we're gonna make one and we will get through this that I'm steadfast in it's just it can be fun some days thank you for your time L thank you we have attended date yet when we're going to do the walk that walk I would I would love to look at the end of this month or or beginning next month um department heads aren't used putting their numbers together till February um there's some moving pieces that make this part of the process really difficult for us um I do have my state valuation but like I don't have my County I don't have my County um budgetary which which is not unique um you know I don't have I won't have school till February at the earliest um with your approval I have invited the superintendent to present at the February council meeting miss little state of the schools an idea of what's driving their budget because it does impact our budget oh yeah it does um so rather than have a department head who's going to present in a in a budgetary meeting again in the coming weeks I I thought it' be a nice change of pace to to we need to have a close relationship with our schools it can't be obious um you know we we we rely on one another if we have good schools we'll have people live in here um and if we have a good Community we'll have good teachers and and it is all inter related you know we are one organism just two different you know major departments um so if it's okay by you guys i' I've extended that invitation for her to come help us understand what they're dealing with it's um it's a it's a unique Beast I'm not going to sit here and say I understand how school funding works I I'm still working on Municipal funding at this point um but I would say you know I'd love some tenative dates if if you guys could help us with that so we can get it on the radar of our department heads and come up with a plan my hope is to do it all in one night yeah it may be a long longer evening than anybody wants uh but I'd like to at least at minimum see Public Works the library and the community center um and we'll put the rules in place I've talked to MMA legal about how we'll do this um because it's a first first time that we'll have done this it has to be open to the public my thought is moving forward we' make it part of the orientation for new councilors and budg advisory members and then it wouldn't be a giant meeting unless we had something we really wanted you guys to explore further um but that's that I have a plan for IT department heads we've discussed they're on board they're excited to have you guys come see their space um yeah they're proud of it and they're you know so um I'm open to it we could we could do a doodle poll if that works by you guys um Emil versus just throwing up dates Rand too don't know your your preference work through the chair or yeah whichever I mean I'm pretty open there end of January beginning February which whichever way dat yeah I just when we do the walkth through you plan having them present like you know but budget goal like some of their really talk to about the things that are driving their budget in their buildings so it's going to be same night the tour uh no I I really do chain I I really Envision it being less prepared and more um here are the things I I wouldd like to point out um you know we're in my office hey uh the the building here is sinking and we need to work on the the drainage of this building you can see the cracks in the wall in my office and then in the conference room uh we need to look at a plan to to replace that uh the flooring uh when it's damp uh we get high humidity it's trip hazard we don't replace in so many trips and falls our liability is higher it's been pointed out in safety uh inspections um you know so a few of those kind of hey guys just be aware when we start talking about these things they give you a better visual you know if we need to replace something or or roof but also you know just to give you familiarity with the spaces that we're talking about um and other opportunities we're looking at like in the in the rec department There's an opportunity there that we're exploring uh to potentially have that more accessible to folks Around the Clock um it's going to take an initial investment but we think we've got an idea that might allow us to do that um we're in infancy stages of that so I'm really being kind of cryptic um because they don't want to promise something that we can't deliver um but we're looking into other ways of delivering services that also enhance the livability of the community so I I think that's a piece of it um so it's not I don't think it's all just look at this crack and boy this needs to be but I think cumulatively you know here's here's what the space is when we're talking about Public Works what's it look like you might have seen it from the outside when you took your recycling back have you been inside what's a what's a wheeler versus a 550 um it'll be limited interaction with the general public just because it isn't is a meeting and we have to conduct it as such um but I'll be open to to taking questions from the public and and figuring out those answers and Reporting it back to council and we'll make it work but I I do think it's you know going into the the fire base and seeing the you know some of the the deficiencies and the awesome equipment that we have there and what we're doing um I just think I think it'd be worth the effort but no I I anticipate this is an entirely separate kind of setting of a ground right and then from their building on it with here's what we're looking at um and department heads are going to be engaged in the budgetary process a little bit more visually we're going to try to put some PowerPoints to to put some pictures in and detail behind those numbers because I tell you what I stare at numbers a lot here maybe even more than they did at a bank I kid you not and sometimes it's hard to understand what those numbers are I I'll be honest that that $800,000 loan I didn't quite understand until maybe two weeks ago when it finally sh me I'm like I'm starting to understand where this is coming from and it's know $8,300 in my monthly budget you know there isn't a there isn't a sheet of paper that I can follow along with and understand everything it isn't an instruction manual when it comes with this running a town so I'm I'm learning but I also want to help educate everyone else so that it can kind of see what I'm seeing and what our department ads are seeing well on the opportunities and the challenges and some are near term and Sumer long term and some may never never get fixed you know but we we have to we have to educate to to then be able to fully understand and discuss that field so MMA think I'm crazy you're gonna bring everybody yeah let's do it f Tri so so yes second yeah you you came on board just in time for me to absolutely user all your free time she all right hey I mean it's part of the the process so it is for sure but I but I think again if we can set this groundwork with everybody sitting at the same time then it maybe becomes something that we just do as a as a orientation for new counselors and buis your folks moving forward I don't I don't think things will change enough to to Warrant this level of detail but I one of the things that you guys asked me to do when I came on board is be transparent I don't know how to be more transparent than open and off our doors and say come see can't be open up our books and say here's what we where we're at right um and that's that's what I think I present every month to you guys and I'll continue to do so maybe to my detri um it is what it is right I'm sitting here my head spinning I don't know if you hear me or not you guys hear me yeah we can hear you y yeah um there's a lot to be done I think we need to be realistic in thinking you know with the work that needs to be done to the buildings our roads uh our equipment uh you know and we're looking at know try to get a m right down your tax down you know I no we're not how we G to get it all done it's a lot of work a lot of money fix we're fixing old problems that we're dealing with that that we're left here for us to deal with yeah I I agree with you entirely Kevin I think that's one of the hard parts of this process is you've got to look backwards to move forward and that's that's it's it's it's like a anchor that we're dragging with us it's tough yeah I know and I have a knot in my stomach you know just trying to think of a way how we gonna get this my my my uh the way my money works is we need we need tax weon we need business in our town you know and I think that in order to do do that you know we got to shot people's shoes and like cigars we do whatever we got to do to get come to our town it's going to help us because I mean we we want keep our services we all do and it takes money to do that you know it takes money to to sail the ship you know and it's we got some work to do you know we've got a good amount of money in the in the account right now Powerball is not enough though so we'll just wait till Powerball gets a little higher and we'll strike 400,000 tickets should give us a good shot at I'm just kidding anything would help yeah I I I I I understand your your your stomach C com I feel that on occasion too I I think the key for us is to make sure that that folks know that we're going to continue to be here we're going to make it stronger we're going to make it better it's just going to take it it's going to take some time we're not out of the woods and it's hard we all we all our town so I don't know figure coming up M yes sir do we have other goal items that folks wanted to I know that's supposed to the focus and and I'm not to facilitate here but I just want to make sure that we do have planning board folks coming in here at 6:30 so not to expedite um we have an alternative plan if we want to be here but um Are there specific goal items that we want that you want me working on is this list that I've provided seem to to align with what you're looking for from us as staff I mean I can't give you hard numbers I don't have well I tell you what I'm think I'm thinking if we can just keep moving on the way going keep chipping away these bills and uh you know try to keep our taxes and our M down to where we're all somewhat comfortable and just keep moving forward because we're living in a time not just before Fairfield like look I'm down here in Florida and everything down here is just as high as is up home the only I can see down here that's a less up home is a gas I gas up yesterday at 285 gallon but everything else is is just as high it's just the times we're living in right now I think we keep pushing on the way we are and keep going in the direction we are Tim you're doing you're doing a good job you know you're figuring as out as you go you know Kudos you you know and we we need to I think if we keep pushing on the way we are things eventually I'm hopes will we get better you know we going to watch our spending that's that's that's the other thing and you know just just keep chipping where we are and try not to uh try to keep our our our taxpayers uh you know happy about we're doing I think we're doing the best we can right now with what we what we have we have come a long ways the last few months and last year even and uh we just we just keep keep pushing on the way we are I think that things will smth out eventually I mean we're not the only ones you know struggling right now our child's like only child struggling other child are struggling too we just we just uh like I say we need to keep our spending in line just keep chipping away what we go get get get the de behind us if we can near B I don't want to keep uh dealing with Reserve but at least we can deal with one thing get the among all of us and and I don't know how if anybody else feels like that but we need to settle on if we're going to continue having reserves how is it going to be handled well if we continue to have reserves where are we going to get the money for reserves right that's something to think about yeah I mean you take money out put expression yeah I I think it's going to be a slow process of rebuilding them to actually reflect Bank balances versus what what I consider right now unfunded liabilities you know we've made commitments and that's on behalf of the council and uh you know I mean it comes that you guys are the ones that sign off on spending um not to put it on you guys I'm clearly managers play a role in that but those Reserve accounts are the way I understand it from the conversations I had basically liabilities you you've committed to X the hard part is is it doesn't change your cash flow if you take $110,000 out of reserves it's still coming out of cash flow um that's the reality of the situation we're dealing with so that's why we really don't try to go to that Reserve well currently um you know when I look at at you know kind of the preliminary numbers in my head of this process um you know I think we have to look at trying to find a plan to fund those back with real dollars um but I don't know the speed with which we do that um clearly clearly some of that's mill rate and some of that's other spending right and where what are your other budget drivers going to be um and I think that's really where it's challenging to say you know you know in January your mill rate is going to be X I have no clue you know I I I truly don't uh and your valuations play roles in that and and we're gonna have to look at that because our our sales data says values are up um and if we want to continue to receive full reimbursement from the state we're going to have to look at that as well um you know and and that comes at a cost that's in that quarterly views and and full CommunityWide assessments nobody nobody enjoys the assessment process and nobody loves it sorry Tony nobody loves the assessor right like it's it's just like the appraisal process you want a high appraisal uh when you're selling but you don't want it when you're buying like it's it's this and it is that sort of a catch 22 scenario but we have to look at the reality of of property values have I don't want to say skyrocketed but they've almost doubled in Ur County on on average in the last four to five years and really mostly in the last three um I'm pretty plugged into the sales data properties in this area it's know it's eye opening so we have to make sure that we continue to move that needle so great you may be able to reduce your mill rate because your valuation up but what's your effective tax rate and that's always been my I I I no offense I really don't care what the mill rate is and I I don't really want to be quoted saying that but I were really the number I care about in the end is is what that says I ow right yeah because we can always manipulate the numbers to make it look different exactly and that's why I don't want to get my I don't want to commit to some sort of a rate when I don't know what the final number needs to be there's too many pieces of that puzzle um but what we need to be looking at is what that effective tax rate is and that's you know uh we saw in here cared last year and I and I don't mean to you know belabor the the conversation but they dropped their Mill weight but everybody's bills went up between seven and 12% because valuations have gone up so the mill rate is something to celebrate if it's low but it's really what's the bottom line what are you pay and that's what we really have to continue to keep our eyes focused on and it's it's never going to feel affordable I've never once been excited to pay my taxes and and and it goes right back to me paying myself um so I get that I do but I think we have to be realistic in our in our view from January we really can't start to set an arbitrary line that we cannot cross without knowing what that that total number is because again we can always fool ourselves into thinking that you know it you know that that piece of it is what drives it no it's it's how much we have to collect in total taxes we have to cover our expenses p we've created some crazy debt that also includes is included in it but let's not create for yeah I do not enjoy the idea of paying $15 in interest to borrow money that I'm going to collect later this month uh it makes me it makes me feel icky we will look at a revolving tan next year because we can manipulate that interest payment um you know there's tools at our disposal where we can do this better we're kind of handcuffed running into this year um and and I think that's an important piece that I just I just don't want to make I don't want us to see us get hung up on that piece of it when you know the total spend is really what the bottom line is you know and it's going to depend on other reimbursements from the state things that we don't control what the County charges us you know um that extra extra six Monon budget is a a is a challenge so I have some thoughts I'll put them on paper um when I get get a chance um but it's yeah yeah I think it's going to be an interestingly difficult budgeting season every single one is I think that's why I sent the email that I sent yesterday that listed what my tenative goals are and that is kind of like a stay let's let's stay where we're at and get the transparency gather where we're at so we actually know what the numbers are know where they're attributed to know what we're looking for and be able to better plan with actual numbers instead of what we think are actual numbers but they really aren't yeah um I think there's a lot that can be done again my Mantra is going to be for this year and for as long as I'm on this Council that we need to be looking at Economic Development and increasing our tax base bringing businesses to town we don't have a place we can go in and sit down and have lunch anywhere we can't go any place and buy batteries we have to leave town to buy Essentials and that's kind of that that our town is such a nice town and we have so many things that we offer and we have this excellent staff and excellent department heads and excellent people working for this town and again we can't even recognize them with a lunch anywhere because there's no place to go so we have a lot to be said and we have a lot to do and I think we need to just step back take a deep breath and continue to do what we've been doing which is paying down the debt um and being realistic with where we need to be people don't mind paying their taxes I mean we all mind paying taxes but people don't regret it or resent it so bad if they know that there's a real true purpose that they're going to you know if they can understand where their money's going they don't mind it that's right Fair taxes and we may have some dis disagreements around what we believe are fair taxes again it depends priority exactly and I think that's right and taxes are always right on the edge of what you can't afford have to make a decision whether they pay their tax or pay their fuel bill or buy groceries I mean people shouldn't have to feel like they're living in a town they're making payments to town they wouldand live in their home that's not that's not a good feeling and I hear that from people work it's not a place to be anyway I didn't interrup back back to the reserve accounts real quick this is just a thought that I was having but I'd say you know if Mike or Matt or Darren you know they come in 10 or $15,000 under budget instead of us putting that back in our general fund there's a there's a there's a quick easy start to fund what's hard with that process and I fully agree right like there should be an incentive to save on your budget yeah but it becomes cash flow too yeah but how do we how do we differentiate between that um I think that's one of the challenges that's before me um I don't really want us to get into a point where we have 32 different bank accounts because this is but I think we have to have some better definition of where those funds are where they sit I also think we need to try to find some short-term vehicles to put those funds to work when we do have that positive cash flow generated from the you know the end of February through the the beginning of October or you know whenever that shortfall comes um I'd love to see us get away from the tan process Al together and just have that be there as a safety um but that's a that's probably a more of a long-term goal um but that I think that's another piece of what we have to look at we're going to have some cash on hand soon that will be the money that we spend in September what can we do with that to monopolize the fact that rates redown are high on deposits rather than just sitting on that camp so we've got I've got some thoughts on that I you've got to see where we kind of end you know February the beginning of March really have a a more concrete grasp on where that is clearly the tan will be gone we'll be into the back into the positive of cash flow um it it's it's yeah we really have to be aggressive with our money management is what I would say because we're leaving dollars on the table for yeah a lot and that's the beauty of that is you know we're willing to do that work because we see the benefit of it you know and if that's you know5 $10,000 net outcome that's positive for us it's worth the effort oh yeah so we you know we've got some ideas but it's it's gonna it's going to be a process but yeah how do you how do you directly allocate those dollars that'll be an interesting challenge I don't disagree because you've got your carryover that's for your 2024 you know operating I don't think historically we've done a good job of kind of differentiating what that those savings are yeah um so I'll be curious to see how that works at year end it's I I think you got a good point and I know we've discussed it in the past I just right now I not sure how you do that but we'll try to figure it out so yeah uh just real quick Tony Billy Joe raised her hand so do I have to have her come to the podium this is your work session you do not allow the public to speak unless you want to oh okay so I can they're not contributing to your conversation okay your work session okay so if they have but if they have a question it's up to you you're the chair okay are we talking about potentially investing Surplus am I understanding that right the way I would look at it I mean operating opting operating Capital right so hard to call it Surplus it's funds that youve generated in this fiscal year that you're going to use in next fiscal year so but yeah you could be looking at you know 30-day short-term CDs I've seen rates at 5.69% if I've got $100,000 I'm not I'm not going to touch for 60 90 days why not why not generate income off it rather than just having it sit there two years ago for 05% not worth it's not worth the effort maybe you know but to generate you know I mean $250,000 at 5% I'm getting $1,000 a month you know so yes that that's the thought process well yeah the practice it's prac yeah the practice in the theory sounds great practice is going to be the challenge right it's it's like the theory behind how do you allocate some of those Reserves which Cas is the problem yeah Mr tol I'll hold mine for public comment oh okay uh well there's not I just want to stay in line with what Tony corrected us I'll hold the public comment just so you know there's no public comment period to this work session there shouldn't be no no there's there was only there was only one in the beginning okay yeah I'm good I don't want to go in violation not no no no no no Tom Tom go Tom go right ahead I was just going to interject what Keith mentioned at one time the town used to do that yes and the reserve accounts it was set up so that at the end let's say that a department had $20,000 left over half of that would go into a departmental reserve account half of that would go into the town's General Reserve account so they have the town has done that in the past so it's not like you're doing something that they haven't done and and the reserve accounts did grow and they did build for a time period Town sort of got away from that concept along the way but for a while it worked quite well yeah and and that's what I I the way to do that I guess Tom is that's how do you do it in an equitable fashion right if Public Works let's say because we hadn't plowed till January 9th um saves that much in their plowing Li I know you know does it turn into pavement or does it you know or does it get allocated across all departments and I think that's that's where I have more questions on how to do that in in an equitable fashion but I I do agree with you I think there's a way to do it I just it's been such a process to get up to speed to today that I really haven't dug into what to do with extra money hasn't really been my problem for the first three months you know I mean I I want to put it you we're gonna get through this and I want to make sure you realize that I'm I'm positive that there's a way forward um and and we're going to be creative and we're going to be aggressive and we're going to be fine it's just we have to also realize that the starting point is you know we're starting 100 meters back from where we should be and that's that's why I sure we have good momentum and we're going in a good direction I just I just want to temper that excitement because I don't want folks to be like yeah well they're gonna we're going to be down to 12 and our mill rate like no like no the the sheer volume of need and and unfortunately in some cases neglect is it's big and again that speaks to why we'd like to steal some of your time I'm not going to borrow because I'm not going to give it back um but we want you to understand where we're coming from so that we can then have you help us make important decisions on the best ways to move forward and what our priorities are because you you guys control the pen right you guys control the vote and we've got to work together with this process and I the have most faith in our departments they are they are some hardworking smart people and better looking than but we're GNA we're going to do a good job great job that's why we're in the position to be able to say what do we what do we focus on and how do we fix it sorry I this where it came from um but are there other things that you folks would like to to have us seek out goals I mean clearly getting us back to a point where we have zero g would be fantastic it's going to take us a long time getting back to a point where we have fully funded reserves will be amazing I will fund a townwide barbecue on my own po you know like I will celebrate that day um hold heck yeah um um but we also have to realize that there going to come at a cost because there's other things that don't show on your line items that are going to cost us because we haven't addressed them but we're going to have to and and and we're going to be creative and addressive and try to fix it so again I appreciate in advance you allowing us to seal your time I think it will be time will spent as far as a plan moving forward I think it'd be kind of nice to you know say have like a plan say call it 5050 but have so much go towards debt and so much go towards infrastructure you know what I mean so this year here we're going to be able to set you know say say the magic number is 200,000 100 100 and but if we can figure out a number that we can set aside so that way there we can we can improve on our infrastructure and paid debts at the same time so that way there you know we're getting a little bit of each and moving forward yeah yeah no I I fully agree I think what what you have to temper that against uh Keith is also uh opportunity cost yeah and and part of that is and and again I'm going to defer to counsil Gillan the cost of getting things repaired yeah is only going higher yeah as someone could put a new kitchen in this past year um so yes yeah savings is important but also you know fixing windows that are bleeding so much air oh yeah yeah contributing to global warming on the level of about China is a problem you know and we and we really need to think you know there's a cost on your utilities yeah so there's a cost to not to to not taking those actions it's going to be a process oh yeah yeah it's going to but I do agree I I I think that's right where I'm I'm in the same mindset it's got to be debt debt payment and and repair work and that's Paving Andor facilities yeah and and working to just D this budget and drive it CU yeah if we don't invest in what we have we we lose more and more I can't to tell you how much energy cost those are only yeah yeah 283 sounds like a steel florida4 everybody remembers when it hit $5 yeah you know where are we then if we're not fixing energy improvements and driving those enhancements and but it's hard to do when you're saddled with debt so it's it's going to be a d sorry to make laugh but I can't you got you got a you got a good way with words I think we're glad we have you on board I'm glad to be here some days it's it's it's a great challenge in front of us and a great opportunity and we have to look at it through that lens of opportunity because we could just just crumble under the under the weight of the the totality of it we we just you know we always talk about how do you how do you eat an elephant bu at a time we we're going to eat this elephant we may not digest it but we're going to eat it we're to fix Jim you got any you got any thoughts he touched up on everything that I've written yeah but you you guys had yeah I will I will uh leave this meeting then with this action item uh again a reminder that our regular council meeting is on the 23rd of

also not uh to transmit anything in executive session be a moris Cod yeah don't don't be bringing that on you uh next item up for bids sir would be acceptance of the minute from the December 20th council meeting yeah NRA provide us all with our minut from our December uh 20th meeting and I entertain a motion to accept the minutes as read so motion motion second second any discussion all those in favor I I I um I have no other others um there's any other Business Council would like to discuss I know councelor wet had looked to potentially set a date for next week to work on Council budget items so I'll sent to all of them yeah so I I didn't have I waited yeah one's a Good's a good time you pick the date you got how long do we figure it'll be it'll be just a I don't really know I've ever attended one but and who does it involve us just the council the council well it's an open meeting right yeah it'll be the same kind of setup yeah so um yeah I'm I'm not familiar with process it's never been uh done before yeah so um yeah my schedule's tough on Monday and on Wednesday now next week um but if the council to me Tuesday Thursday or Friday uh Tuesday I think I'll be out of town okay what no the 12th I live the 12th be yeah I don't have anything so I'm good yeah I mean so if we want to set that for the nth um and and I'm not sure the format for that meeting it's never been done before it's part of the um recommendations that came out of the Consultants meeting with the town for more uh engagement in the budgetary process in so time usually do six um so if we want to do next Tuesday at 6 as a special meeting I do we have enough time to get it published and presented and all that we need three days so we'll have that uh the only conflict with that potentially is there's a planning board meeting at 6:30 so I don't really know what about the 10 which is Wednesday he's busy I've got a conflict on the 10th apologize I did have it this morning but it was brought to my attention I a problem so yeah I'm good I'm going next Tuesday so do you even want to shoot for half hour earlier at 5:30 since we have full use the room planing board will be here that again that evening at 6:30 really for election of officers their meeting is very brief yeah we'll get to see who they are yeah yeah so they they potentially could they're both public meetings so it's better to have here I would be I mean I don't know what the format is or what the the goal of the meeting is other than you guys to tell us what your budget priorities are um we're sitting down I can tell you where we're at the budgetary process uh we're sitting down with department heads on the 9th uh looking back at you know so we'll look at current expenditures we'll look at current revenue on the nth uh we'll be looking at uh infrastructure needs so both equipment and place um so structures um and then uh we'll be looking at the budgetary process um the next step for us is to bring you folks into um our space that is the goal um I've talked to mma's Legal team um we believe it needs to be budget advisory committee counselors and the public being invited to this this open Forum um so I'd like to do that late January early February time frame um would be best for us um because we really like to bring you guys around and show you where we work what we do who we are what we what we have outlined is is some of the potential needs that we have as staff um for maintaining or improving services and that can be equipment based facilities based what have you um so the goal would be to do that um we would do that in an open form it would be like any other Workshop uh no public comment is going to be really allowed or taken the public can come in and observe um there are certainly some places where they can't really follow along um Public Works garage is a perfect example um so we'll have an area roped off for folks if they want to attend and be present they're allowed to observe they're allowed to to listen into the conversations but they aren't going to be permitted to just kind of wander around through facilities it'll be shephered guided whatever um just like we would in an open house down in the fire department uh with their staff there to kind of talk to you about a piece of equipment should residents have questions during that time period um they're welcome to to direct them to me and then we can answer them at an appropriate time frame or bring them to the council um but it won't be an open Forum back and forth again if somebody says what is that I'm hoping we can have a reasonable layer dialogue but it really is about fact finding uh for Council and budget advisor committee so we'll need to get that scheduled up as well but MMA has has signed off on it that's the way we need to do it so so this meeting next week is for the council refresh me because I don't remember it from the from the results of that we have so many recommendations we haven't followed through on many of them so there's this is one of them this is one of and what is it the first one the council gets together to Define what we're to give them our go so this you know they have something to work with so we're going to give some guidelines that we hope to have them achieved okay okay do we have a process for that we don't right know we have to discuss it and you got you know everybody's got to you know think of you know whatever you're thinking of I know I have one that was started with Foster a couple okay okay yeah so next Tuesday night would be good Tuesday at 5:30 Tuesday at 5:30 5:30 and for that agenda we'd be just looking at basically a budgetary discussion yeah agenda item we'd probably still have to run it the same right with roll call and because it's open to the public right yeah public comment period at the beginning the only other thing and this is on the on the agenda for the meeting on the 23rd to 20 that we're going to have um historically we've had public comment period at the beginning of Council meetings U so this is just a planning seat um we'll end up having a discussion on this later um the last three Council meetings we've had public comment at the end of the meeting as well um it's really going to be council's decision if we continue that practice if it's been useful or not we're we're clearly indifferent I mean we only had I think one public comment at the end of a meeting and it was can you clarify uh why something was tabled yeah um so again just something we didn't put it on this Council agenda but something in the full council meeting that we should have decided do we want to continue to extend that for period of time or not so just wanted to plant that seed so Jim would that be something you suum have on its own or would we be able to incorporate that in our next next meeting well I think you can incorporate at next meeting yeah all our goals yeah individual goals yeah yeah we could yeah we could just put that under under new business and new line item and have our discussion then okay I'll add that on there I think it would give Tim at least a better indication of where we're at yeah yeah they're starting we are we are definitely starting I mean it seems like every month relates to Budget on some level or not at least from from my seat um you know 3 months in today um so it's been a lot of learning but a lot I'm also just trying to understand what those drivers are um it's it's ey opening what we do as a municipality I didn't tell you that much so that three months has gone by pretty quick huh it has yeah yeah but I mean that I think that's a big piece of what we're looking to do in this budgetary period is is generate more awareness um not just from the transparency purposes but just also what we some of it's where we're falling short and some of it's where we we're selling I there's there's there's good in that it's not you know it's not a bleak picture that we're painting but um we need to look at it through the lens of how do we how do we grow sustain maintain do we you know so um again just some stuff that I I would think we should do as we work through that process so maybe maybe that's another item we can put on that agenda for next week is also trying to set a date for the um those walkthroughs um it'll be it'll be a long night I apologize because it's going to be two different site visits plus this entire building so wear comfortable shoes and oh that's going to be on the 23rd also no that'll be I think we on the 9th we should set when day that is we should look at our calendar it's pretty heavy over the next month yeah well I was just I was just saying with gym there but we could probably incorporate our budget goals into the 23rd the meeting on the 23rd oh you wanted to yeah so we wouldn't have to have a you want to do that on the 23rd okay I I think there was a disconnect so was yes yeah disconnect Oh Oh I thought yeah I was thinking we could put that as a under new business on the 23rd we can unless there's a lot of other business that's GNA happen on the 23rd uh right now it's G to be there's a few things going on for sure on the 23rd yeah um nothing no major lifts where we couldn't have that conversation I mean right now we're at the very empy of of identifying needs and then trying to distill that through department heads right like what do we see needed positioning so we're looking at Staffing we're looking at equipment we're looking at um materials that's really big piece of what we're doing on the ninth um at our department meeting so um and then clearly looking at it with that eye towards potential use for CDs Grant or what have you oh yeah well yeah we got all that going on on the 9th I guess that'd be that'd be all right too that's going on with our department heads in the morning oh in the morning that that night I mean I would have just a prelimary conversation with you guys about what we're hearing oh okay we'll have our our end of year numbers but not our fiscal year yeah um we should have those at the end of this week yeah yeah yeah the night the night to be fine okay yeah so then we'll we'll put that together and I'll uh I'll shoot you guys out a draft agenda tomorrow for the nth y okay and then we'll take that off the 23rd okay um and then like I said we'll be looking at trying to schedule a day of basically site visits um um that's that's pretty much what the MMA wants us to call it it's not an open house um we're not popping you guys popcorn and drinking you to a meal sorry so but so we are going to walk you around um a little bit so definitely prepare for that when thate set that be a little bit longer into the night we also Li as well and then everybody here so fantastic any other business or items folks anything else anything else I have motion to adjourn okay motion second all those in favor I I we will get an agenda out and publicize the meeting on the 9th tomorrow thank folks well that was two easy meetings in a row Tim and I think,True

the floor for public comment period anybody has anything I'd like to read a comment um I'm sure that everyone has noticed how beautiful the Christmas decorations and lights are on Main Street this year uh I know there's not that many U businesses but it still looks pretty good I'm impressed when I drive down and see all the the light the wreaths lit up on the teleph on the polls people have commented to me on how amazing Fort Fairfield looks right now I know that many people have spent many hours and worked hard on this the Town Council wants to give special thanks to the quality of Poli Council and Merchants for all their efforts now I'd like to make a comment on the light parade I thought the light parade was outstanding a big thanks to all the town employees especially Matt Mike and everyone at the police fire ambulance and Highway Department the arts and craft display were also amazing it makes the town so welcoming this an outstanding effort from everyone to highlight the beauty of Fort Fai very well said J thank you anybody else okay Mr Town manager thank you sir so under licenses and permits we did have one uh liquor license renewal that had come in from the kns of Columbus to r that I move yeah motion second second any questions all those in favor I I and then uh under the financial report uh it's been an interesting few months as we still try to understand uh operations and cash flow especially me it's a first time I have had an opportunity to really see the seasonal nature of a of a business it pretty much brings all of its Revenue in in a two- Monon time period uh I guess I understand what farming's about a little bit more now yeah um so uh but actually the uh the month of November presented a few challenges to us financially uh and an expense that we incurred that we certainly was something that we knew was coming down the pike in terms of having a circulator pump failing and one that was uh starting to fail uh so that that cost is going to be absorbed uh through um the administrative Reserve ultimately uh but we'll need to look at budgeted expenses related to par of the community center uh when we start budgeting process next year uh cash flow was uh a little tighter in November than I had hoped um I think the difference being that last year we there was a call made to citizens to kind of pay taxes a little bit earlier to help us through some of our cash flow pinches we didn't make that same uh request this year uh but we still dipped into the 10 less than was expected in our cash flow u under Dan's uh estimates we look like we would be closer to 700,000 we're about 625,000 and that probably is where our cap is going to be we're going the other direction at this point um with Revenue in the month of December being a lot more robust and it's kind of gaining momentum as we head towards the end of the year so um so we're looking good there uh in terms of Revenue um we're a little bit higher than budgeted uh a little bit of uh lag on the projections of the ambulance service uh Chief and I joke that we can't make people be sick uh so we may want to make those a little bit more conservative though uh if they keep responding to calls at the level they have this week we're GNA be fine uh those guys have been out stream and I do apprec appreciate Chief being here uh to give his report a little bit later on um in terms of expenses tracking exceedingly close to budget uh again with the items that are uh running higher than anticipated kind of the main three being insurances utilities and wages um I think we're going to get some relief at least on the utilities uh I anticipate wages will continue to be a ma a major driver for us especially as we look at what's going on with other municipalities and Employers in the area um you know the cost of Labor right now is is very expensive and it's only going to continue to um we do anticipate that we may be above uh expenses also when it comes to elections uh we had a a a tremendous turnout uh for the elections in November much more than was anticipated for what really is what we consider to be a an offe election um with not a lot of local uh items to kind of Drive voter turnout um yet our turnout was exceedingly High um and we actually ended up uh going to print extra Ballance several times uh just because we wanted to make sure everybody had the chance to vote on a local basis so good that people participating um but next year we'll certainly have to look at that line item as well with it be the presidential election um continue to just dig in trying to understand uh our budget process and revenue and expense story and you know overall things are going pretty well um yeah so staff are doing really well um got a lot of folks learning new roles not just me uh the next item up on the docket is a uh report from arotic way Solutions and Mr reesy our board member good evening councilors good evening um we met our our last meeting was November 17th and in reviewing of our up to date October uh income statements our income was up about 28% for that period and year to date we're about 1.4% which is about right we try to stay pretty much at break even our not budget um we also um get some information from Mark on where we are our CES five and six project everything has been completed except a few pump pieces are missing for the for the pump systems which we won't need to we actually start using those cells we don't anticipate to start using them until sometime in April anyway so everything's going fine there um we uh also renewed our contract with car utilties District there's a slight increase that's built right into that lease agreement with us for them I just will always remind you guys that that's a phenomenal amount of Revenue we give them this year we as of November we passed almost 10 million gallons through the Utilities District and I still think that somewhere down the line we should take some initiative and look at making sure we have a second place to put that past is going to become a very big problem with landfills alog together U and anything coming out of our Le it's gonna have that in there and there may come a time when the B does care you put up be fast in and we can do something else with that fluid coming from the landfill so I just try make it a point to tell you guys about that all the time so we don't forget that we need to be looking at that sometime um we passed our budget and uh a lot like that that was just talking about we decided to increase our capital reserve budgets for equipment and stuff like your pump fil uh we're going to gradually build that from 100,000 a year to 150,000 a year it's spended 100,000 a year for 13 or 14 years and with the price of parts and materials going up and replacement things going up we decided we should gradually build that up over the next couple of budgets to 150,000 a year that's about all we had then scheduling our next meeting we don't meet in December so if anything comes up though I'll report it that at the January meeting thank you Mr thank you thanks Ste next on the docket uh with our round robin of department heads we've got the Fire EMS Chiefs report and thank you Chief J for being here on an exceedingly busy work not a big deal not a big deal good evening good evening where has 2023 gone I can't get over how fast this this year's gone um call volume for November um we're a little bit above average on both fire and EMS so we had 38 calls for EMS in no November and 15 on the fire side and that's not counting uh the volunteer department we they do a lot of fire prevention stuff and they're still meeting weekly for training on Tuesday nights um and it's the interesting thing is so far in December we're actually matched those numbers and we still have few days left in December we're at 38 EMS and 15 uh fire calls and we had three more EMS today on top of that so for the year so far we're at 603 EMS calls and 115 fire calls so we we've been we've been pretty busy um we've been working uh with our smoke detector drive so far we've installed and put out uh over 40 smoke detectors out into the community uh so it's been pretty busy with that as well because if they need help with the install we we put them in for them um actually we we actually passed out eight of them today so we've been pretty busy with that one thing that we're finding when we go on calls that's that's one of the first things we we take care of before we leave to see if citizens have working smoke detectors and if they don't we try to take care of it immediately we're still finding out there's still a lot of people in Fort Fairfield that do not have working smoke detectors so just urge everyone here and everyone listening you know please help uh help out and notify people let them know to give us a call we'll we'll take care of that um I've also been working on um the state of Maine uh the legislature just voted a in a a bill in July I believe and they're just starting to get the information out there it's an EMS stabilization uh funding there's like $31 million uh to help out to help stabilize the EMS departments in the state because they're finding a lot of departments are closing down and it's putting the bur burden on the surrounding communities and another part of that is Recruitment and Retention um there's every day there's more and more job openings for EMS in the state and there's less and less people coming into the field because of burnout um the cost of Education just so many Dynamics so they're they're they've recognized that there's a problem in the state of Maine and right now it's a one-time funding thing um with the hopes of doing it for five years and then finding some other long-term solution so I'll be working pretty hard on on trying to secure some of that funding to to help our depart help our town and um we've recently which is I believe is the next item on the the docket is uh I've been approached by our local CB CBP uh station uh the Customs station they have a few of their agents that are actually nationally registered EMTs and what they're trying to do is they're trying to get a team together of their employees that are uh nationally registered a chance to get some some actually real life training so they've asked if we would partner with them uh some of the things that that this agreement would would do is it allows them to get their real life experience uh on calls we would basically put them in our rig as a third third member um we wouldn't have to pay for that person and' be on their dime it gives us like I said extra people on the rig it helps strengthen our ties with this Federal agency that's that's right in our doorstep um it increases their capability so basically if they have a large scale incident um and say God forbid one of their agents gets hurt they can start providing care to their agent or even a citizen because they're they're they're everywhere in this town uh these agents they're sometimes they're faster than us because they're already on the road so we gain that benefit that they're right there taking care of one of our patients just before we get there and they have the skills from riding along with us um and one thing I do want to mention is that I I believe this me memorandum of agreement actually shows the professionalism of our department our guys our crew it shows their confidence in in our department and just want to point that up speaks volumes of our CH too well speaks volum it takes a team takes a team so and I do want to mention is out yes yeah it's starting to become a regular event to have a December or January I out is over the river's looking great I'm glad to see that it all pushed through so we don't have a repeat of next year it was a busy weekend [Music] yeah that's all I have I don't know if you guys have any questions on any of that now that's very good news though good work thank you yes yes yeah and Keith I I do think that you hit the nail on the head that it really has you know it really does reflect the professionalism of what they're doing and and the other piece of what he he hinted on is God forbid we did have some sort of mass casualty incident um you know just having another four five six trained hands in our community does not hurt yeah you hope you never have to use them so I do that's why I wanted to make sure we put that out there that that we're looking to enter into this and they pay the people they on their you know dime they they're covered by their insurances and benefits and their work C and it just really gives us an extra set of I think it really does speak well to our department you suppose we could entice some of the ments there to maybe help Darren's Department too I I I asked him I said you you suppose we could entice some of the magents there to help Darren's Department too I've been try to get to drive excellent uh thank you Chief uh the next item is for you to set as the council chair uh realistically the the first day of uh the new year we uh bring in our new council member and set assignments and chairmanship I believe you have a date set in the agenda like sir yeah yeah January 2nd that's good for yep Shane January 2nd is good for you okay fantastic so uh I've put together a little bit of an agenda there and in that meeting we can look to potentially change the January meeting we'll get it out a little bit early it looks like that may change from the historical third Wednesday to to the fourth Wednesday just in this January y um but we'll get that that word out after that meeting right now we'll decide that there y um the next item up for yes sir has that ml you been signed have you been authorized to sign it uh the mou has not been signed we were working on a date on it I believe if I need authorization to sign it I would move that to new business also and get you authorization sign it when prepared okay okay okay no it's not signed but in order to put it in place so happen immediately you need an agreement okay okay so uh so we need a motion right business I'll add that okay EXC that's all I have for report sir okay all right so old business a council vote on ordinance number 2317 to prohibit retail marijuana establishments take a motion in a second I motion vote on this okay motion I have to second I have no choice yeah had a second second any questions or discussions all those in favor I I Pat no no okay majority of those present y y so voted y yep moving on to to new business uh the uh Public Works director had put out and the council had approved uh putting out to bid the sale of some excess Public Works equipment uh we uh advertised that we had some folks take a look uh we only received one bid each on two of the pieces equipment that we were looking to potentially put it into a a scrappy basically with it wasn't a big uh they weren't wasn't anything that's going to move the needle too much um but we did not receive any bids on the piece of equipment that we had set a reserve on of about $3,000 so uh we would seek the council's approval to accept those two bids and also to approve the sale of that excess property that uh international 1900 uh by negotiation allowing the the Public Works director to do basically what the police chief has done with some of his Cruisers try to find a buyer at the highest possible price again it's just sitting there and going to depreciate basically so um that's what we would be seeking to approve on I so motion that we approve what can just read out motion second second all those in favor I I uh item Item B is uh a a casualty of the power brown outs that we had on Monday uh it is a power RightWay request not an easement I apologize uh I had to reread it to make sure it actually doesn't need Council approval but I wanted to bring it to council because historically when we've had more than one pole placement we brought it before the cancel uh this would be pretty straightforward uh citing five polls in the area of Route 1A and conet Road um for vers uh they've provided the schematics and the locations Public Works director I both revie find no reason not to to grant them access to the public right away in that area um certainly could entertain a council vote if you wanted to since I have it under new business yeah okay what do we need to do to R uh we would just move a approval of allowing vers right away okay so move that we approve the right away okay second second all those favor I I and I'll read my my paperwork a little more closely when we're not losing in power about 15 different times during the during the day on Monday Monday was definitely a challenge um item C under new business is the uh is a request that we'd like to put forward uh so at last uh council meeting uh Council voted to approve the acceptance of a $50,000 Grant from Huber engineered Woods under their your community Grant which helps us Kickstart the renovations of the uh tennis courts basketball court next to the pool uh given that the town historic cash flow going into January and February is to uh to collect taxes and to pay off um any sort of loans that we have and then have some cash on hand it didn't really make a lot of sense to to me as a as a reformed Banker I guess that we would just uh use this utilize These funds to pay down uh 25 days worth the debt or even 10 days uh it made sense to me that we hold these funds separately um that right now banks are offering some very competitive rates or other financial institutions could be a credit union um that we' look to not use these funds until July anyway because we're not going to be able to do the construction um so my our request is that Council grant us approval uh to uh invest These funds in a short-term CD um we expect the rate to be somewhere in the air 5% I've done some phone calls to some people um and that we would uh generate about $1,200 in interest on that $50,000 which we would also utilize towards that project give us a little bit of contingency little extra shot in the arm to get us over the hum um so we would seek Council approval to take those funds and put them straight into a SE I so move that we end the authorization to do what he just mentioned with those funds motion I second second all in favor I I thank you very much I know that uh every little bit helped uh and I would add an item D under new business just to authorize me to sign the uh border patrol mou you folks have the details in your packet um again I think it's it's a win win for our community uh for the border patrol and certainly for our EMS Crews and it just strengthens those bonds between First Responders I think it's I think it's just awesome I really so we would SEC your on that entertain a motion for the authorized signature yes I'll make that motion okay motion second second all those in favor I I thank you very much approval of the minutes sir I'd like to ask for a motion to accept the minutes from the November 15th regular council meeting in minutes of the November 29th public hearing on Mo number 23-17 Mo second motion second all those in favor I I I uh also enter Ain motions for warrants number N9 and 10 number nine in the amount of $646 7772 and number 10 in the amount of $430,500 62 make that motion okay motion second all those in favor I I any under other no sir okay got our last public comment period of the evening any body has anything to add I I know councelor kill cullins is not here and is under the weather weather uh we had intended to and will at a later date just thank him for his many years of service uh to the community I just want to make sure that's reflected in the record as the state would have been B's last council meeting as a council member currently yeah how many how many years we I want to say it's nine I believe yeah there's a break in between yeah I think it's 14 yeah right so so several terms and you know so we just like to publicly thank him and we'll take an opportunity to thank him appropriately the next time he can join us yep very good entertain one entertain one more motion motion we turn second yeah all those in favor hi are you okay with me that in the morning",True

comment period go to the podium state your name three minutes talk evening everybody good evening uh my name is Kevin Hunter I'm the patrol agent in charge of the fort fairf for board patrol station uh tonight I wanted to come and speak to you guys and just to let you know how much that our station appreciates the support of the community and that we're thankful I mean I know it's been a a longstanding tradition it goes back a long ways that our station has been a couple of different locationsin that the the town uh but we're thankful to be able to to be a part and have it in in your guys's town uh not all the agents live in Fort Fairfield I myself do not my son attends Fort Fairfield High School my wife works at the Middle School uh we chose Fort Fairfield over many those schools been the uh on no small part based upon the reputation of schools in the city itself uh I've been at station since September of 2021 uh since that time I can say the relationship between the boorder patrol and Fort Fairfield Police Department has grown and matured immensely uh I cannot recall the number of times that our agencies have been able to assist each other on call outs whether it be uh us and the lead or for Fairfield PD and uh Chief Cummings he's he's great to work with uh we try to meet as much as possible try to discuss where we can help each other out um and uh to create a stronger working relationship between our agents and our officers we also look for ways that we can collaborate when it comes to training and other areas to increase the safety amongst our own Workforce and to create a safer Community for for fairfi uh as example of how our agencies have worked together just here in the last month officer whippman uh made what made have seem like an ordinary traffic stop based off of a movie violation uh that stop turned out to be two individuals smuggling Jordanian citizens that have recently crossed the US border Canadian border and smuggling through main uh we are seeing an influx of these types of of incursions that are happening not just in the community for Fairfield but also in other parts of the areas that we that we Patrol um your Chief assists as much as possible as he can especially with the limited Manpower that he has and in turn we do our best to back up his officers um especially when they call we help them identify substances with the equipment that we have and in general we just look out for each other when we're out there on patrol I myself I worked in five different states I worked in four different uh porder Patrol sectors and I can tell you in my almost 25 year career I have not seen or experienced the cooperation between two agencies that I have here in uh with your Chief um and if I may take a little bit more time I'd like to show my gratitude to Chief Cummings for all you do for the board patol I'd like to give you uh one of the uh first re uh Renditions of the station coin thank you good good work Chief any any other public comments be hard be hard to talk Mr Hunter okay uh get the floor Tim correspondence and reports uh we can skip right past uh letter A licenses and permit we have consider for us uh going to be uh on your scorecard um as I mentioned uh prior to the start of tonight's meeting it just feels like we we come forward and we we put forward all this effort in uh enabling the elections to occur within the municipal building anding of you know enabling of the municipal off officers not everybody has access to the internet not everybody has access to computers um so I just wanted to make sure that we had recorded the election results because not everybody's aware of how those shook out uh so we'll have a new counselor joining us uh come January 1 with Shane Millan uh and the two School Board officers were Melissa liby and chalice white just uh just wanted to create some awareness as we work through this uh process seems like we have an election and it just kind of goes away so uh and we want to thank Council Kil Collins for his service to to our community we'll do more of that on later um moving along in terms of the financial report um I sent along the advisory to books earlier in the week uh it had been an interesting month uh with some challenges pulling some information together with the staff member out um we did do a really deep dive into the summary um general ledger the revenue summary and expense summaries for October um basically uh expensive month when County taxes are du so it always uh is makes for a little more of an ey popping warrant you'll see that later on with warrant number eight um we've done uh some adjustments to how we manage our cash uh so we can pay a lesser amount on our tan uh so rather than keeping a a larger bank balance um and having more cushion we're running a little bit more lean so we're paying less interest on those funds until we can get back into a a more positive cash flow as property taxes get paid uh just a one way that we can reduce our expenses um you figure um you know 30 days of having a $50,000 tan is you know you're paying about $150 more a month 150 buckes is a piece of equipment we can buy for one of the guys in one of the Departments so um or something that we can get to the library or utilize within the office so um so we're really running a lot more lean that way uh tan usage total usage is $400,000 currently anticipate we will touch that tan a little bit more here this month um especially when we go to make our school uh payments um but realistically I'm we're going to stay well below that hundred or that million dollar threshold uh tracking the budget we're below budget uh when it comes to expenses um but really the three areas of concern that that we're going to continue to track insurance utilities and wages um all are running at or close to uh budgeted um so certainly something will continue to watch but as a you know being a third of the way through the year we're doing pretty well so any questions that anybody had on the financial reports that I had provided and again apologies that they came a little bit later than anticipated but we wanted to make sure they were right it's my first time seeing the tax commitment in there so to be honest that's that's a big piece of off um I would I wouldn't count my Revenue before it's in my bank account as a as a homeowner but apparently as a town we do that a little differently so I'll be honest that was a piece of I just kind of this does not look right but I've been sure that is exactly how we did it so I I'll own that uh that's good for you folks I'll move along to the county barus budget so we've got an interesting situation that's going to be this year um the county of arusi wants to move how they conduct business and change their budget cycle from um you know year you know year start to um June uh July one start June 30 matching our fiscal year um the reason that the county wants to move to that um that that budget cycle is that it will reduce their costs in borrowing um as Ryan pauler put it to me in a conversation we had the other day uh how many businesses bill in February and collect in November it's a long time to go without revenue and it ends up costing the county substantial the end result is we'll end up with a six Monon budget that they will pass here and uh give us a bill for in February um we'll also receive a full fiscal year budget from the county for their 2425 budget in March or may um and then we'll have that to pay come November 1st that's mandated by state law um ultimately what will happen is we'll have half of our County tax due in addition to a full County tax payment due in this next budget cycle so we have some options on how we can look to pay that um we have the option of paying the full amount this year we have the option of paying half of it we have an option of paying a third of it when it comes to in November of 2024 four um my suggestion is going to be that we pay a third or elect to pay a third and if we can pay great um there's no penalty to us or interest to not pay them in full and then we can uh pay that as it comes due basically what it will cause is our County tax this year was approximately $300,000 um you take half of that it's 150,000 that we're likely to be on hook for for this six-month period And so we'll be looking at $50,000 installments to pay to the county over the next three years to help them get their budget cycle aligned with other Municipal Cycles um just want to make you guys aware that that's coming down the pipe that means that we'll probably have to budget $350,000 or so uh for County tax payment coming member um and be looking at a similar hit or higher depending on how much the county raises their taxes um in future years so just something that to be aware of it's coming um I think it makes sense for the county um I like that they've given us flexibility and time to pay it so we certainly appreciate that any questions on on that I know that's a little bit of a deeper dive into it but without understanding it and then trying to look at that budget line when we see that next fall you're going to just say well wait why or this spring say why is that so much higher it's going to be because we have this special six-month window and we're going to have to pay that additional piece so is what it is yeah pretty much yeah we're gonna have to pay it I mean I I don't think paying it all the front has any Financial benefit to us um if we don't get a tax or a penalty on paying it in increments so it should make it easier to swallow shouldn't impact the M rate or tax rate too much but it's you know it's $50,000 piece of the puzzle that you know for three years yep so any question questions on that uh without further Ado I invite Mr reesy to stand up and uh tell us what's going on over to can't call it TR Community Ro Solutions thank you sir uh we had our last meeting on October 27th uh we in reviewing our SE September financials um our income was down about 12% for the month but we were pretty well on par for our year today our expens were also down a little bit which helps some and our U interest rates are rising higher so we seeing about a 30% increase in what we had budgeted for our interest rates so we're in pretty good shape all together um the bulk of our income comes from one particular customer they contracted to deliver a certain amount of waste so if we don't get it in September we'll get it by November pretty steady same for us to do so um an update on sales five and six that project has pretty well been completed all the work's been done there's some mine of clean up that's being done out there right now but we're all set to use it we're ready to startop building Mark also made us AR rest of some problems that they're having down state from from maybe Bango South on what they're doing with their trash and it could become a really big problem for them fairly soon um so we're putting out some fiist to some of the towns that are closest to us to see if we can help them relieve some of that and then we're also looking at how that could affect us uh in our longevity so we're trying to make some decisions based on that we don't see there a big issue there one way or another but we at least want to offer that ability they need that stop cap place to come and bring some stuff that we can help them out uh historically we've done that in the past when we closed cell one and cell two U Back when kenel was running it and uh it actually had a good boosted income for us and it really provided some filling we needed that we would have to provide we had put dirt in there we didn't use that fill so we can hisp doing that doing it well uh in preserving what we need problem abilities and then we reviewed a draft budget and we should be voting on that Friday and everything then looks pretty good for going into next year there any other questions I want go help someone with see so The Feelers you're putting out that that's out to other municipalities that may need to find a place to bring some of their waste yes like sou as far as even south of Bangor no not south of Bangor some of the there's some of the small towns Dan and that close to oura whose trash goes down to Bangor now and it kind of works really through the same P people that are calling it from home up to us now so uh we're working with a h partner to look and see if that becomes an issue that we that that would be an option that would we have room for it per that much more it's not very much more I think the Mark is looking at maybe 3500 tons which is okay really it would be less than 1% of what we have coming into the landfill so but me just help things from ping up anything else thank you Steve thank you very much thank you thank you Steve so uh up next uh we'll have our police chief Mr cumings with Department mon good evening good evening uh thanks for the opportunity to give you a report on the police department I'm not sure when the last time I was up here doing this was I feel like it's been a few months um it's been a busy uh summer and fall for us um staffing has uh we've been a little bit short-handed with an officer at the academy uh since mid August uh he's due to graduate December um been a little bit of uh I guess creative workings of the patrol schedule to get us through but we're we're getting there um we're trending at uh so far this year 3383 incidents for the year uh which puts us about 1,200 over 1,200 uh what we were at this time last year um and I just don't see it trending downward um at any time the increase uh demand is obviously um the issues that we have with substance use uh mental health um domestic violence um the schools have been keeping us busy lately U with behavioral issues uh in the schools um instances of violence and and threats in the schools um on November 1st uh there was an incident a Statewide incident where threats were made online uh by a gentleman causing most of the schools uh in the state to go into a lockdown State because of these online threats and um within three minutes of uh receiving information um of that this gentleman was actually in Fort farfield uh Sergeant Cormier in officer whippman had the the gentleman in custody and in the police station so I need to commend those those two uh officers on their their very quick uh prompt response to that incident that put a lot of people uh Statewide at ease a lot of parents at ease um in the wake of the tragedy in Leon um there's been a lot of focus on um you know potential copycats potential repeats um a lot of parents scared to send their kids to school uh we we've really increased our presence at the middle high school and the elementary school um for that reason uh to put parents teachers and students mind at ease knowing that we're we're here and we're always going to be here and we're always going to respond um uh total cases uh so far this year that we've referred to prosecution uh 171 adults 16 uh juvenile cases presented for prosecution which is probably triple what we normally would run uh in a year um we still have six outstanding War requests we've been successful uh with applying for Grants as you as you're aware um I I I have one outstanding that I haven't received word on um I'm trying to replace our body warn cameras um the ones we have have proven to be problematic they they're not reliable they don't always turn on the batteries aren't reliable um if an officer is in a scuffle or has to move suddenly they fall off the vests and it's just an issue but they're really pricey so before we have to dip into anything I'm I'm trying to get Grant uh funding for that um other than that our budget looks good we receiving reimbursements from the state um like normal um we have funding to use for Homeland Security Stone guard and details we just haven't had the Staffing to to do that right now so hopefully in the spring we'll still have that money available and we can start to help the border patrol with increased patrols uh to help them out um obviously you're made aware of issues happening cross border and I think the more people we can get out there to try to help with that um the better so do you have any questions on anything I went over I know it's not the most Pleasant and stuff to talk about because it's kind of the Doom and Gloom of the community that nobody likes to hear about but how about how about your new Cruiser get that I yes so we have the car uh I had it uh decaled by uh kushman's came out really good nice and visible um it's currently being upfitted with uh the console lighting cage gun mounts all that stuff that we need for that so hopefully we'll have it next week and ready to go and I currently in the process of trying to sell the other one for the the most we can get out of it y the rise and CME I mean it's a lot more than was a year ago you you think it's because of drugs or I think that a lot it has to do with the mental health and substance use issues most of our crime seems to be revolve around that so whether it be drugs alcohol whatever other impairing substance there is out there that that people use we we see a lot of that and sh the services that we have in the area I mean we don't really have much for inpatient and outpatient is difficult it's it's such a needed service um just like mental health um you know we rely on the hospitals to do our our crisis evaluations and you know AR gold and Carrie they're running seven eight beds in the emergency room that are just tied up with mental health issues and not health issues so you know the emergency departments have basically turned half into mental health WS when they're not really equipped to do that so um it's it's a challenge and I we need more services we need we need help with this our officers are are are being asked to respond to these mental health calls and granted we're we have training but we're certainly not licensed clinical social workers and um you know we don't claim to be we try our best we try to deescalate people and get them safely to services but it's it's it's an issue thank you you're welcome thank you question thank you thank you is she so I'll kind of run through a few of the other items here in reports and I know you guys have writeups on all of these just wanted to recap real quick the uh the border crossing meeting um we're at step one of many many many many many steps in the process before we get a replacement to our land port um but uh it was a good meeting with about 15 maybe 20 residents attend uh it's a pricey process uh they're looking at a 35 to $45 million price tag um they'll be trying to incorporate the historic uh land for of Entry that is there uh now into their design um they met with some impacted or potentially impacted land owners in the area as well um it was a good meeting I think we made them aware of some unique um items that are related to the Fort Fairfield border crossing uh the international appalation Trail only crosses in for Fairfield uh so there was they became aware of that and and that we have an A Comm on both sides of the Border um so that maybe they would look at it more with a critical eye towards non-vehicular uh access across that boorder uh so it was a very good meeting and uh and we have a good uh local contact that lives here in for Fairfield that's overseeing our project as well as the one that I'm any questions on that has there been a a a general Arrangement drawing of that site come out no they're really in the environmental uh seeking out contractors stage it it hasn't really yeah they said they're at step one we kind of felt like after we left the meeting and this is by no mean a slight it felt like the step before step one um really just a fact finding hey we're coming in to look at this um so it was very very early I me we're looking 2026 at the absolute earliest before we see a shovel hit the ground and that and that might even be aggressive um and that's if funding stays for these border crossings it's 150 million that they're going to spend across five different border crossings uh three of which are in the county um so Limestone Fort and holton's getting some upgrades um good news is out of it that that I took away will remain a 24hour Crossing so that's good um I did not know the difference between a permitted uh port for commercial traffic and not we are not we are a permit for we are not a commercial port and that will remain that way so um just that has to do with offloading and searching of larger vehicles and um but very good meeting um and there's some opportunities for us to leverage that work being done pend potentially some grant opportunities uh we attended a program on it I think we're a little early in the process to be able to participate this round but they tend to have those rounds annually so we continue to look at that and keep the lines of communication open and as we know more we'll let you know more any questions no fantastic uh as you folks know we had a a tragic fire here in for Fairfield uh earlier this month that claim the lives of three folks and and uh and unfortunately the the investigation makes us believe that there weren't working smoke detectors in the home so I wanted to make you folks aware that the uh you know as part of many different ways that this community has responded to this tragedy um our fire Crews have taken it upon themselves to do a smoke detector Drive um so far they've raised about $3,000 um I'm not sure if Mike has a breakdown of how many smoke detectors or what the price point is I I just ordered 110 smoke detectors this morning with the funs that were donated yeah and these will be smoke detectors that have a sealed 10year battery in them so we're not just fixing this problem for one one time period these will be an extended life um and they're willing to install them in folks homes I believe Chief J said they have a a sheet a page long of uh homes and residents have requested these so um hopefully making some good out of a bad situation and clearly um you know other things in the screening just tremendous place and and very very proud of this town for stepping up and getting behind this family and the young kid that was left behind uh to support them and I just this is one way we could do something as a community and I'm very very proud of our our fire department for for taking this step so just want to make sure that's out there good work Chief uh moving on we did have a resignation uh so I'd like to publicly thank thank Kevin buard for his commitment to serving the town cour faer field he served on the Northern main development commission's executive committee uh he provided notice uh to me at the end of October that he would be resigning this position uh so I have to attach his resignation to this uh this notice and wanted to make the council aware um next item is a little different we were approached by The Faculty at the University of main business school to particip in a program that I never heard of called undiscovered main undiscovered main seeks to use a sustainable ecosystem economic development model Bo it's easy to say five times fast um but basically assisting rural communities to connect with the alphabet sou different organizations that might exist in the southern part of the state that we just don't know about or have access to uh and bringing together all these resources from public uh entities as well as well as private business uh to help rural communities uh develop Economic Development models uh we're going to look at potentially uh doing a project with them related to utilizing uh the Artic River because uh I think it's an underutilize Resource as somebody who kayaks it multiple times a year and and hangs out in it and and it's just it's a it's a beautiful untapped resource um I think all the way through the county um and it's interesting uh some of the folks that were're represented in here happen to work for Oldtown canoe so um so they have some interest in in in paddle Sports as well but we're going look at the community as a whole just wanted to make you guys aware that they're going to look to have a stakeholder meeting with us um and it's an opportunity for their graduate students to gain Real World Experience uh working with communities so anything we can do to get additional resources and leverage them for enhancing the economic opportunities and recreational opportunities in our community is welcome so I want to make you aware that there's no cost to us to participate in this program um and hopefully they can bring us some resources to help us do some good work so and then the last report I had is just want to make folks aware in trying to use this opportunity that we have here at this meeting to make uh generate some awareness that the holiday light parade which was very successful last year will be taking place on Saturday December 9th the lineup will begin at 3:30 um at the kind of the old Jenkins School uh for those who don't know where that is lower for Hill Street for staff School Street area uh the Paro kickoff down Main Street from forest sta to the community center at 4:30 uh when the parade ends here at the community center there'll be a um craft fair cookies and cocoa uh a band and chances for families to have their uh child's photo taken with Santa actually right here in the council chambers um we want to bring people back into this community center and utilize this space and uh so it's an opportunity for us to get folks back into this building uh and reconnect with our community um so I just a just an awesome event and we're looking to to build upon what we had last year also be doing the home decorative competition with the qu of dut place counil again looking to do the judging on that Sunday the 10th if the town manager ever gets a b flyer together so work I promise I know the guy any questions on any of that good stuff it is uh I will turn it back over to the chair for old business okay uh so a council vote for ordinance 23-15 to establish adult use and medical marijuana business ordinance I move motion secondy any any discussion can I seek a point of clarification yeah okay so you're looking to establish adult use in medical marijuana businesses this was a ordinance that you folks tabled yeah yeah yeah so yeah right we're opposing it yeah yeah yeah yeah but we had to bring it up to V right bring it back off the table Yeah right that that was not what I had heard and I saw Tony's face turn pale white oh yeah I thought you did not see that motion reads you're approving it as as it was submitted right yeah yeah but if we don't we don't vote well it does put it on the table and you can vote on it that's his motion was to support the ordinance as presented right so we had a mo motion second all right so now sorry to interject yeah so then you just go to vote and then we discuss discussion yeah for discuss so I I would like to just back up and I uh I got to personally take my feelings and just set it aside um and I meet and do business in many ways with a lot of people in this town and as of this started and we tabled it um there's been a lot of input and the input has averaged 50/50 I got to be honest with everybody I I I've got 50% no and 50% yes so I look at it how we going to establish a happy happy ending on this and and you're not gonna you're not going to establish a happy ending on this Bob it's not happen well hear me out well me out I'm just just just discussion and upon and upon listening to everybody and and the concerns of everybody if I adjusted the concerns to what the other 50% of the people would like to see in our community we could adjust the place of business not on Main Street uh we could conduct part of the ordinance that would allow it not near schools not near public places as such stated and Main Street um and if guidelines were set to an orance that would put it where it wasn't an exposure other than if you wanted to do business then that's kind of a happy medium that's that's what I come up with so I uh let me tell you what I come up with okay the people I've talked to most of the people I've talked to are not in favor of it we because a lot of people feel it's a gateway drug uh we just heard our police officer our chief just talk about a lot of the problems with drugs and stuff in town they've been to schools whatnot what what kind of a message we send right youth out of 500 towns in main like 46 is 47 it's legal to sell Medical marijuana well this is the second amendment SS in town right anybody that's using medical marijuana or using it for recreational uh purposes it's ilal own a firearm very true there's a lot of reasons why we're not going to generate much revenue of selling pot in Fort Fairfield you know I'd be a liar if I said I didn't try this I me most of the people here probably try it once or twice in their life or maybe even use it that's up to them personally I don't want to send that message to our youth and we have a lot of law enforcement officers in our town Federal and our local police force what's it say to them I'm not in favor of it you can like I said you're not going to make everybody happy the majority of the people in town don't want it the majority of the people voted Us in I'm not in favor of it plain and simple you can slice it any way you want or try to public Cod it any way you want B I'm not in favor of it I've had a number of people approach me this week that are very disappointed that we would consider Revo looking or reversing and going back to the old ordinance of no marijuana um there are some people who've approached me that specifically use medical marijuana they still can they can go out of town and they can do it and they'd like to be able to stay in town and do it they can do it here medical marijuana yes they'd like to be able to purchase it here in town without leaving town they're elderly people and they don't want to travel and I I'm not going to argue with them I they see a medical benefit to it they where where do they go right now I mean I've had people approach me that have said please please don't let that happen just like you've had people approach you saying please don't let that happen so we definitely have a we had a period of time where we had we introduced the ordinance to revoke it we held a public hearing and nobody attended nobody seem to have any input as to whether or not we had a medical marijuana um ordinance in place in favor of or against until we reintroduced our new ordinance that would have allowed Mar Medical Marijuana and marijuana sales in this town and everybody all of a sudden has decided let's make this an item to discuss we don't want to do it five of us voted to have that revoked earlier this year and now five of us have decided that we've changed our minds I think well I think that uh there's a number of us needed to know more about it and didn't weren wasn't really sure of exactly what was how that was all playing out after I listened to people and thought it through it's not I don't think it's a good idea for Fort Fairfield I really don't well we're just kind of we've done a lot of work for it we've done a a lot of spent a lot of time on it and now we're kind of at a I mean we still it sounds like there's still a lot of discussion to be made around it I don't know I mean we kind of I don't want to say foolish but we had an ordinance we revoked it and now we want to put the ordinance we revoked back in place and in the meantime we don't have any ordinance at all time to think about it had time to think about it I don't know again I'm still in the process of not wanting to be I I just think we need to be open to business that's all good business okay any further discussion okay I go to vote Kevin so what are we voting we have we're we're voting to against for or against the ordinance to establish adult use in medical marijuana we're voting against it right yeah well well you know you're not voting against it you're voting to establish it and then so a no vote would be against it Kevin no Pat I Jim Bob no no I vote no okay just let me apologize I just wanted to make sure we're all on the same page yeah didn't want to interject there but like I said at the same time so anyway audited financial report we did receive the town's audited plan report you guys have a copy in front of you uh we do have copies here at the town office we have a copy that's also going to be at the library sted tomorrow uh if folks want to take a look we also will post a digital version of the audited Financial results the good news is Auditors found no weakness or deficiencies in our internal control roles uh and any previous deficiencies that were identified had been corrected um from the previous years so um it's good that we're in compliance uh no issues

UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,EGy3ipDS1lc,1Nov23 Council Workshop on ORD 23-15,,60.0,3582.0,2023-11-15T16:02:20Z,none,110,0,0,0,"like to thank everybody or Mrs wette for coming out tonight in the it's six o'clock uh all councilors are present besides uh councel Co Collins and we'd like to open it up to discussion of the Med medical marijuana ordinance number 2315 so in this Workshop clearly you guys had received feedback uh I had sent any feedback that was received folks the only piece of Feb you guys do not receiv was one other res that reached out to me a few minutes before the the Town Council had started just again another Resident Lacy who had just said they would prefer we pass this ordinance um that was the only feedback I've received um I'm not exactly sure where in the process you guys want to go with this or if you want me to moderate this discussion but well um I'd like to voice my opinion because I have been talking to some people uh I think the majority of the town is not in favor of it I talked to some people from prescy that uh incredible people Pascal have told me that uh around these dispensaries there's a lot of people hanging around waiting for the places to open he said they're kind of BL Shady looking people and they're not too happy about that I think that uh personally I'm gonna make it very clear I'm a Christian and I'm I'm very proud of that and I place a lot of my my uh my thoughts and my feelings on uh biblical principles I I am not in favor of it because I don't want to send a message to our youth there's plenty of places for them to buy this stuff all the way from rout route 1A from Fort Fairfield all the way to mwasa to Fort Kent there's people selling it from their homes there people you can go there and buy it you can buy it in Pascal or Caribou uh not only that it's a state law it's legal but it's not a federal law so what does this tell our federal agents that work in our town is basically throwing us in their face because they the federally is illegal federally I'm not in favor of it I'm not and I talked with a few of the other counselors that are are not in favor of I know that uh there are some people that are in favor of it that's their business but the majority of the town that voted Us in I'm going to go with the majority of the people that are not in favor of it and I am myself not in favor of it I don't see where it's going to help the town I really don't see how it's going to help the town what are we gonna get out of it what what what message is going to send to our youth um there's some other things I'm in favor of if this is all being recorded I won't go into it if it wasn't re being recorded I would I would go into it is not right biblically stuff is taking place in this town okay I know that's how I feel okay I'm not in favor because it's a Gateway Dr good point it's always has been and uh all the parents that I've talked to in the community Point Blank told me we should not pass those ordinance got plenty of other places they can purchase the product if need be I think that as a town we we need to take a stand on some of the stuff that that as far as I'm concerned just because it's a law doesn't make it right there's a lot of things are a law but doesn't mean it's right I think we did take a stand originally and we reversed the ordinance yeah we've had time to think about it too Pat but right now we didn't we've reversed the ordinance so we don't have any ordinance in place now at all um I'm not I've heard people talk about their reasons for not supporting it um I think oftentimes people come from that point of you emotionally I think that a a lot of the surrounding towns do do have ordinances that have approved it I am not against it I would prefer that there were some limitations and some parameters set around it in order to have one in place here I don't want to just have a wide open ordinance where everybody anybody can come into town and have you know so then we end up like you know some of the other towns around us that have got six or seven or eight I don't think that our little town could support that I'd rather see if a business comes to town it's going to be successful and I'm looking at it from a business point of view um I think that if it's done carefully I think if it's done respectfully I think how do you think the town's going to benefit from it that I think there's a lot of people Kevin truly that use marijuana as a pain reliever as an anxiety reducer not so much for if if you look at the picture of people hanging out on the street corner smoking dope um yeah that's not the vision we want for Fort Fairfield but there are a lot of people who have medical marijuana cards for medicinal purposes I if we're going to do a marijuana ordinance I'd like to be able to either specify whether we have a medicinal facility only or whether we have a medical medicinal facility and a recreational facility I think there's two different things if there are indeed people selling it out of their homes then that would be more for recre recreational and if that's happening in the town within the town lines we should be receiving an application and we should be receiving the fees for having that business in our town do you think that it becomes more accessible to our youth by having that in town no more than coming what's that no more than alcohol alcohol is just as detrimental to families and it has been forever right ne ne neither one of them good exactly so why do you want to add to it well I mean we're not a Dry Town you're adding you're but we're adding to what's already I've heard people tell tell you know people have said I don't think it's a good a good idea to have in the town of Fort Fairfield and and I've heard that I've also heard that there's people who've said I really it's not you know the first thing on my list of things I'd like to see in town however if it's done respectfully it's not down on Main Street it's done with some parameters around it and they'd be you know it's not going to affect them one way or the other and I think the same could be true depending on where it is I think caribou's facility is located outside of town by by d's market so and I can only think of one place in presca where you see people hanging out and that's the one right down on Main Street by I don't live in presc I'm not there every day but I you know I don't know well I mean I'm not it's it's I don't have anything to do with it I don't use it I don't but it's it's there it's an option and an opportunity for the town um I mean right now we've got to make some kind of a decision because we don't have any ordinance in place we don't have anything that says we can do it we don't have anything that says we can't do it and until we have something in place we're stuck so there's my my there's that's where yeah yep my my stance from the Geto was you know maybe business and and you know bring some Revenue in and and the uh answers that I've got as far as being able to what what we're charging or what we can charge is it's $500 per loc is that what Caribou gets or just to apply just to so what do they get what do they get after that I don't know what their fees are mine mine that for the license you mean 500 for the license just to apply what's that just to apply it's a $500 fee but then depending on the facility that you have if you have uh a medical marijuana uh store what P $2,500 license fee yeah this is the Fort Fairfield ordinance this is the proposal I think the longterm cost and long-term effect is going to be you know you can't how you gonna put a price on that huh how you gonna put a price on that nobody can see in the future I can't see where this is going to bring good to our town I really don't I don't want to send a message to our personally I don't want us to be sending messages to our youth like you know just because it's legal doesn't mean it's all right like you just mentioned Jim you know it's a it's a gateway drug and you know kids if it's being sold in town it might be it's going to be easier for them to get they experiment because kids are curious you know and I think us as adults it's our it's our responsibility and our duty to protect our youth I can't find that m um I know that we've got some significant drug problems in town that have nothing to do with marijuana and they have nothing to do with alcohol and I don't think how do you know that that seriously I mean how you know that how do you know what they're taking for drugs I have watched somebody across the street in a car be Nar canned by the ambulance I've watched drug deals go down outside in the parking lot and I've watched them go down in the store um and and they're not it's not a drug deal for marijuana it's it's they're doing drugs they're doing drugs they are doing drugs so what's what's marijuana it's same thing as as alcohol same thing as tobacco it's I mean it's all the same one of the big things right now in schools is all about vaping I made a delivery to the school today and they've got signs on Vape Vape free zone and there's a vape vaping workshop and assistance in quitting if you're vaping that's a huge thing that isn't anything in your parameter or mine I've never even that I don't want to add to that was never an issue I don't want to add to that stuff though I think we've got this there's already enough of that stuff out there going on that our youth are being exposed to I just don't think it's right to put more of it out there just don't yeah uh I mean I don't know I this is you're only adding to a problem we already have making it worse that's my my opinion thank this is just this is just one time fees I annual I think you guys are missing in the ordinance packet the schedule a that it refers to yeah yeah so just went and got us C that which I appreciate thank you and this I was looking for that earlier this evening and I have is it an annual fee we I've got the schedule but you have it yeah I do have that I just didn't know if it's an annual uh which is what yes I don't know on care boost so but if you read our schedule a it's $500 application fee and then an annual lure fees okay every single and there's different fees for different types of establishments do you have this yeah I do well I know when having conversations with a couple of people that are have looked at opening a facility um there's some pretty stringent requirements around opening a facility around uh security and safety and guidelines and how you can handle it and how making drugs the community of course is got to have the majority so if anybody was going to do a big girl that'd be an expensive of grow wouldn't it well yeah but I'm just that's what I'm looking at 7,000 ft that's about half the size of our new building and I just can't imagine somebody having a 7,000 square foot grow operation for $30,000 a year in town I don't know where my place is to interject or not but I'll just say where I don't get a vote um but I do run the town or at least I'm trying to um I just want to make sure that we're focus on the fact that regardless of how we feel about the the ordinance that just drafted or crafted um I think it's important to reiterate what Pat said we have lifted the prohibition so there really isn't any pro in place of any type um so that's what concerns us chief of police zoning is just sending one a clear message what we plan to do but the other part of it is right now if I have an applicant that walks through the door I really don't have any any way to stop them from establishing pretty much anywhere as long as it meets current cuse so just want to make sure that that's brought forth cuz that was my my concern when Ted this so T help me help me understand yeah so what you're saying right now is if somebody wants to come to town and open and sell marijuana they can do it yes because we don't because we have don't have an ordinance in place because we don't have an ordinance in place that so us as a council if I say I'm not in favor of growing and however many others and if we get a vote and we all say or half or enough of us say we don't want it then we put an ordinance in place and we don't have it is that correct yes you would need to introduce a new ordinance to prohibited again right okay I guess that's why I want to make sure we're on the same page because it seems like the conversation has shifted from do we allow it or not that that kind of ship had sailed when it was repealed so that's our legal opinion I'm not a lawyer but so there's no prohibition or any sort of ordinance in place to regulate it it would allow someone to come in and potentially establish a place that's why this ordinance was okay forth to regulate it gotcha yeah so we could we can't vote on anything tonight can we so we'd have to bring it put it on get it on the agenda again and then bring it to a vote after tonight in terms of this in an ordinance to think we got to do a public hearing again yeah any any amendments to this ordinance would require a public hearing and then another council meeting to move that ordinance I think it's a big enough deal that we have another public he and then if we need to do that right that is if this is amended if this is right denied or approved as is you can move forward in the November 15th meeting okay um and then if the goal was to not do this ordinance and do something different prohibited restricted amend this you would have to introduce a new coordes okay I've talked to try to get my brain around it too because so I'm still learning guys yeah look so we all we all are yeah so so why don't why don't we I've talked with Jim I know Jim's not in favorite I know Bob's not in favor of it pat you are it sounds like you are I don't think Keith's in favor of it and I don't think the majority of the towns in favor of it so why don't we move forward introduce an ordinance vot on what I I guess where I'm where I'm concerned is that we already did this ordinance thing before we had an ordinance IDE let's do it again and we repealed it and everybody voted unanimously to repeal the ordinance and now all of a sudden because we repealed the ordin people had time to think about it well well no it isn't that people have had time that's the case that's the way I see it I think what it is is that people don't pay attention to what it is that we're doing and then all of a sudden I think we're paying attention now because there's enough people that don't want it so we're paying attention so let's let's let's move forward I think I mean we can do that I mean I I I I'm not looking at it from an emotional point of view that I think it's going to be a bad thing to bring into introduce to our children because trust me they're introduced a lots of stuff in their own homes they don't even have to go anywhere else there and I grew up I know what I was I don't want to add to it but I guess we'll have our heads in the sand if we think that it isn't automatically out there anyway I mean I think it it's I I guess if we need to get down into a moral discussion as to whether or not it's right to have legal marijuana in our town then then that's what it becomes it's a moral discussion as opposed to a business decision that says here's an opportunity and there's towns all around us that are making money and they're not making that much money I mean my God I mean if you want to talk about business we're talking about bringing business big business to town that's going to provide jobs for people not someone that's G run a store it's going to sell I think at this s bad a wrong impression to our you any business is a good business I think I don't know another another way to look at it too would be uh that's very small business P that's very small business that's not a big deal at all I don't know we can get $30,000 for 7,000 square fet that's we can't we can't buy a pair of socks in town but we could buy marijuana I mean that's that's another way of looking at it yeah it's true you can't buy a pack of batteries I think yeah I think we got bigger problems but but either way however buy M straps in town you can't you can't buy batteries all the year you couldn't buy M straps in town yeah um but I think the thing the concern for me is that we have no ordinance well we can fix that I'm look I'm not worried about what someone that's in favor of was going to say I'm not worried about that one bit I'm I'm thinking about how I feel how the majority of the the voters that voted Us in how they're going to feel if we push this through as far as as far as like putting an ordinance in place for that you be able to can we just take the ordinance that we had before and just reinstate or you have to go through all the DU process no you have to go through public hearing introduction public hearing but but we could reintroduce like say the prohibition yeah abely can be done I think we need to have another public hearing because I think we need to here I I I I think I just I haven't heard a whole lot of people talking against it except for the people that came to the public hearing so I don't know I've yeah I've I've heard more against it than than for my against itss have been more with with I don't want it on Main Street I don't want neon signs I don't want you know I don't want it near the schools I don't want I've heard the well but I've heard the ones too like I'm not for as long as it's not on Main Street yeah yeah that's what I've heard too I'm not for it but if just as long as it's not on Main Street so I mean they're not for it at that point yeah I mean obviously we need to do what people want so that's what we need to do that's right amen so I just because I had this conversation today related to the not on Main Street component because clearly that's the feedback we've been hearing at the town office um should it be the will of the council to move this forward and want to prohibit it on Main Street you'd have to really be careful with your wording in terms of what other structures it was prohibited around I believe the current ordinances calls for it to not be within a th000 fet of a school um you could probably extend that to be within a thousand ft of a church or something else that would then create those zones of non compliance that would then kind of blanket the main street but we are of the belief that you can't just say not on the street um just throwing that out there as that's good that's a good piece as an awareness thing because I'd asked Tony about that for some clarification myself because that again has been a big pro and con has been if you do it don't do it on Main Street so my question to Tony was if that was what you guys wanted to move forward with how would you enact that and the answer would be more related to prohibitions around certain types of protected buildings again just throw that out there if that's something you guys are looking to discuss and another another big thing that we wouldn't be nowhere near ready to do is you know manage it right as far as the zoning and the and the law the what's the uh am I looking for here but all the stuff they have to go through like the application process well the application but then the you know the checking the building and then this and all the things that go along with it I mean I security and I think those are established by the state and those are I think but who who has to Who police that I mean have a code enforcement officer don't we my understanding is it would be the code enforcement the town manager and the police chief yeah yeah and then your state Regulators also would have a an extra check I believe just because of the type of business that it is okay so you get permitted under a business plan I justly term right you get permitted under a provisional plan there still has to be the components that meet the criteria before you get a license to occupy and do business and I believe that comes from above and from the local level oh okay again I could look into that more but I'm pretty sure that's how it worked with the first um medicinal dispensaries that opened that was a level of State control that had to be met than a local or local level of local control that has to be met as well yeah so it's my understanding that it's enforced by myself the code enforcement officer and the police chief there's another thing that I'm I'm curious about too because I don't know if if if it's dependent on an ordinance in the town or not but I do know that there are other facilities that do sell marijuana outside of this town that either do deliver or intend to deliver to the town I don't know why where it's a drug why they don't go through a drugstore and have you know let them deal with it instead of having these dispensaries you know if if a doctor prescribes it for whatever you know and I'm not saying that I'm against it I think something like that should go through a a drug agency a drugstore or something like that not not dispensaries and have them all over the place you know I'm not in favor of it well I don't know as though all of the facil we're looking at are all medicinal I think there are some that are for medicinal purposes only and they're very very stringent from what I understand haven't been in one but you got to have a card you got to show an identification to even go in the store um I don't know I I know that we can have all the ordinances in place what do we do if there are other facilities that are choosing to do it almost like a door door Dash thing we or they deliver Oh you mean come from another town deliver to fort f mean like like delivering dominoes or something like delivering a prescription yeah boot lers I don't know if you have to have the ordinance in place in order for that to happen or whether if you I mean I don't know what I don't think you can do I don't think there's a thing you could do about something like that but I mean at least I mean you're not exposing your youth to it like you know having it out there with where your youth can witness what's going on and making it look like oh it's it's fine it it's you know must be okay because it's legal doesn't make it okay like said so I don't know I'm sure that this is not a disc this is a discussion transporting it in that's what I'm curious I don't think can I kind of feel like you're asking a question I don't think you can if you don't have an ordinance can you do that because you're allowed to possess a certain amount yeah anywhere we allowed to grow it I mean you're allowed to grow up to so many plants yes but it's supposed to be for personal use I think the gray area that you speak of is the area that is that Recreation is that considered recreational or I don't know what the answer is to that but I don't I don't know either yeah yeah I mean I don't know if it's it's okay if you Barber a pig but you can't take cash like I really don't know I mean you have to think about it in that in those terms of how how do you I don't believe there is a way to regulate against that um I would hope that they wouldn't have blazing vehicles that I know advertise here we are yeah I know um I'm I'm not gonna say that that couldn't ultimately happen and I don't believe there's any provision against that I I could seek a legal opinion on that but just yeah I don't know anywhere in the of main that has that that's outside of the jurisdiction that the business is located but there are definitely places within the state have options yeah yeah and they keep I I don't know they keep looking at the regulations and looking at they just made some other change recently and I don't know exactly what that was but they keep looking at the laws and regulations and it does cause a difficulty for um the federal side of it because again it is not legal federally no and we have a lot of federal agents that work out of this town and uh you know that's a I think that's another thing that's another issue it's just throwing it in their faces too that's right I don't know my questions when we were going to do this Workshop is figuring out details and you know the details were if we were going to do something like this there I wanted some parameters because of what I was hearing from people I don't want a neon sign on Main Street I don't want a store on Main Street I don't want you know at this point it sounds like it's easy enough to obtain through door Dash or through going going one town over you know what I mean yeah so we reintroduce our we could reintroduce our Pro against it then our ordinance will be in place that's the will of the coun you guys you guys tell me what you want to do I I kind of work for you guys I I honestly don't have if there's parameters in place I don't have a problem with it I really don't I my personal preference is not I'm not a supporter of marijuana I don't think it's a great idea but that's a moral and that's that's that's an emotional part on my you're kind of halfway there I'm halfway there with limits but as far as I mean I you know I think we've done a lot of work pretty much for nothing I'm not sure why we changed our minds well look we've had time to think about it we've had time to talk to the town's people about it the town people had an opportunity to come to our work to to the public hearing as well well if we have another public hearing I bet you'll see some towns people here we did see some of our public hearing the last one the first one not a soul showed up and and well we we lifted we lifted the prohibition during regular council meeting that's no we had to introduce it we had to introduce the ordinance and we had a public hearing yeah but we voted on it in regulator so that's why we didn't have a lot of but we had a public hearing as to whether or not we should suspend the prohibition and nobody showed up well they're they're showing up now yeah yeah people are serious about this they are you know the big thing I think too one of the bigger things is uh is uh the majority of the people don't seem to want it it's the majority the voted the sin as a council I'm G to stick with where I'm I feel comfortable with and I'm glad you're doing that that's what we're supposed to do we're supposed to represent the people's thoughts that's right you represent them just like we do kid I know but I haven't heard the comments that you've heard so okay what I've heard is not on Main Street fair enough fair enough like I said I thought more of from a business side but seeing this and I mean door Dash even now like you said they can they can obtain it easy enough yeah and it seems like a lot more work I know I know Mr lak has 100 different titles behind his name already as well as the zoning coordinator zoning officer tax assessor yeah yeah tax assessor yeah your same way yeah I'm noted thought it's a Gateway Dr always has been and I see no I see some medicinal use for it I do too folks in our community that who need that have ample opportunity to pick it up other communities nearby I've got some good friends that are veterans they use it and it helps them a lot and I'm and I'm glad for that's fine I'm I'm not against that at all but I personally I think they should be able to go to the drugstore and get it not have all these dispensaries out here and sending these messages up for our youth and I mean there's I can think of a lot of good reasons why it's not going to generate much money for this town I'd not rather see our Industrial Park up there developed and I not rather see businesses come to town and provide jobs and generate cash flow for our town this is to me this is this is ply what it's going what it's going to generate for our town in Revenue in terms of Revenue it's I don't understand what it was ever you know we need to there was a time in this town back when I was young I was a kid I'm actually I'm not old older than you but I've been in town long than you have gy that means anything but this town had opportunity years ago for big businesses to come to town and they had counselors in back then in in as counselors that wouldn't let it come to town this this is nothing like that you can't even compare what this stuff here is going to do to what that would have done for our town back in the day back when our B border was Freer we had Canadian trade coming across the border when I was a kid you couldn't get through town on on a Friday night we had all kinds of businesses shops and people coming and going spending money and people just I mean it was just a different atmosphere all together I would love to see Fort Fair busy like that again I I won't see it in my lifetime I don't think but anyway s marijuana and Fort perfield is not gonna not gonna put this place on the map that's rard anyway yeah and I'm not sure did I there was is there like a clause I don't unless I read over it but as far as like how many how many marijuana shops per capita is there a no there's no liit on it oh the only prohibition is how close they can locate either to another existing establishment or to churches or to the schools yeah but there isn't a cap per se on the number of yeah so and there was yeah there's no differentiation between whether it's a medical dispensary or a recreational facility yeah I say say we reintroduce the prohibition after having time to read through and see what this is all about I thought we might be able to generate more Revenue off that but from a Bu from a business standpoint but doesn't look like that would be be a whole hepful lot at the end of the day it won't pay for the policing no for the extra policing okay good so we've got to come up with an ordinance we already get all look at the one that we already have right I believe that would be what you would be looking at a revised version of that yeah yeah yeah so we'll have to re we'll have to we'll have to review it and we'll have to reintroduce it corre and then hold the public hearing the same steps how far away would a copy of one of those be right now for the prohibition let's while we're right here let's let's look through that yeah don't see what we'd have to revise or 2017 yeah a yeah Jim how come you're so quiet how come you're so quiet how come you're so quiet oh because they can't hear you oh I'm yeah I can't hear the alarm that's going off in the other driving me crazy I yeah that one that normally goes off during Council meetings is that that's the fire department I don't no yeah that's yeah that that one we're not hearing yeah there's another one that sounds like some of these Hot Pockets done or something I feel like I should entertain you guys but I don't have any good jokes I should bring my daughter up the younger one or the older one oh yeah yeah yeah how old are your girls seven 11 interesting ages good Hall trick or-treating pretty happy but they weren't in their SC so clearly it was warmer than it was when I was a kid I do remember trick or- treat me in my SCU so can you guys hear I can just I can just faintly hear I what do you hear that's kind of scary that tells me my pitch my range is is diminish right I haven't heard it I thought you were all G hold to push for this well I thought there like I said from a business standpoint but it doesn't look after reading after reading through it it just I hadn't read much through it there when I before I talked to you Pat but I I've been reading that two and two and from well I just had more questions I mean I either way however we decided this one in my head wasn't going to stand because there were too many I had more questions about it than I had and so I was more C curious about some of the details in it than I was about whether or not we did it it was just there's too many things that needed to be clarified in my head so I really just hate to see us not I hate to see us turn any business down but again we W turn down good business well then I'm waiting to see some good business well we are I'm waiting to see it I'm waiting to see it happen oh we've just gone through a hard time as a town and we're still we we're still you well and I think again I think that this is is like it's almost like prohibition I think it's going to be something that's going to be time will tell how it all washes out I don't we want to saturate I don't think this is the first time it'll come up again but but I'm I mean it's you know something I'm okay with whatever I I don't know if we're recording us or not we are at this point still I'm gonna say what happened to this I don't know you just lost all the I lost all my hair yeah this be one thing too if it was legal on the F Federal side yeah yeah it's not how many states is it legal in now I wonder uh not Florida it's not you get call we in Florida you're going to go to jail oh really yeah if you read a lot of literature about arijana dispensaries and communities that got it yeah there's every gam that says pro and con yeah and in the end all everything I read is that in the end uh nobody really knows it's legal in 24 States fully legal in 24 States and 15 have medical usage legalized only medical and not recreational only medical and not is that 15 not those 24 no 24 have fully legalized it and 15 and 15 on top of that have only medical um it's illegal in the remaining 12 States it's legal in Kentucky it's legal in marijuana and in Maryland and Missouri Idaho Kansas South Carolina and Wyoming it's fully illegal but I don't know anywhere else that's all it says in this article oh wait I missed I missed the state the map um it is uh legal medically in Florida medically medically only right Medical Only I haven't seen anything in Florida it's not legal at all in Texas Idaho not legal in Texas you go Texas at all I like Texas they got they got bigger problems coming across their borders holy looks like South Carolina Georgia Oklahoma I don't know some of the states I can't tell you because I don't know I don't know what the state is guess I don't know my States and and the maps but I had the deer coming in my backyard eat my I left the apples on my trees for the they come in last night they ate a pile my dogs were barking in about 2 o'clock in the morning they would have shut up my day room in the back I got big window so they can see him back there my goat early in the morning I can't find my goat in even I can't find them but they come in the night they're lay laying down somewhere during the day they got it figured out better than I do that wasn't one to Bob with it no no my wife PLS a lot of stuff in the garden kale and they they've eaten the kale tops off all the kale oh Garden huh yeah saw a really nice moose the other day really yeah around here first one I mean in Fort no no no it was outside of caribou oh nor first one yeah first one I've seen they got more up all year yeah not as many as they used to be no they've been hunted to death yeah well at least in this part I don't know maybe southern Maine has more I don't know the thing is they were raising such havoc in this the broccoli fields and eating so much of the broccoli they had to issue more permits in those areas because they I've heard a full grown moose Le can eat 50 pounds of broccoli in a night true you know full adult moose that's a lot of broccoli yeah if you take half a dozen every night broccoli field yeah it's not good brocc yeah so the beeping is STO what was it what was it some sort of clock from the NSA I don't know why we have a clock from the the hallway outside my office I feel a little less I don't know I'm unnerved all the sudden here so so this is the ordinance to we struggled to find the copy of a lot of the records related to the public hearings around it and the memos related to it it was adopted in in 17 yeah 17 I want to see it was why did it get brought back up to change prates Tim wouldn't know that he was uh the discussion was from November of last year that I found can I see that ke you yeah related to I I can pull back but yet there was one on the dorsy road there was a girl there what was that what's that when was it when was that girl on the doy Road in operation or was it oh he that's uh yeah that's Dy yeah he's been doing that for a few years now he's your neighbor Tim I believe it's related to being a caregiver which I don't is a retail establishment under the ordinance oh okay but I I really don't know but I do believe that some of those items are we don't regulate because we're not allowed to it's pretty pretty cut and dry there's quite a lot of data online about the other towns in Maine and what they're doing and it says here that 90% of main towns prohibit Adult Ed cannabis sales 90% 90% prohibit and in another site it says that uh there are 14 main cities now only 47 of Main's approximately 500 towns cities and plantations have allowed for recreational Reta marijuana retailers is that recreational or is it both medical and recreational I I didn't go into the details of the article that it's 47 out of 500 that allow it yeah and another place says that only 90% or 90% prohibit so we're not certainly not in the minority in currently there's 216 licensed recreational marijuana dispensaries with 124 actively operating 44 out of the 57 licensed medical marijuana dispensaries are operational so there's more licensed recreational and there is Medical but 44 of the 57 are operating medically and there's 124 actively operating recreational facilities what's the date on that does it say right there uh it doesn't say this is it's mainan cannabis.org right so this is September 22 2023 there's a lot of really foolish questions in here can I use my card in Vermont so I'm reading this ordin 17-8 my question would become what is retail and I know that's going to sound stupid but I don't think this ordinance was crafted at a time that there was a delimination between disal and Recreation because it doesn't seem to create any sort of delineation between the two so that's the question I I'm not expecting you guys to be experts or have an answer but when I read this that I have that question because I believe this was proposed before the state had I think it was about six months before the state finalized its rules for recreational so I think maybe it's a terminology issue but I don't know if retails are all encompassing or not and certainly would be open to interpretation when you consider there's 5 well there's another thing that makes it a little bit more um that would make you lean towards not not allowing it is if you have um a medical marijuana card you are federally prohibited from owning a firearm so that's where some of the some of the uh you okay you can't have a gun if you have a medical marijuana card I didn't know that you can't have a I didn't know that yeah I had heard that but I just read it on here that said is that true and it says do you lose your gun rights when you apply for a permit to purchase a weapon it specifically States I think it's at the bottom of the first page if you utilize marijuana it's very specific so as far as the the definition between the medical and the recreational St Chang my mind should I just I I struggle with the word retail because I don't to me retail means sales does that mean yeah cultivation does that mean recreational doesn't mean medical again I I think some of that's the age of the ordinance yeah some of that's certainly the business is evolved over time so so just what what medical and recreational establishments would be the way to word it or better way to I think that's probably where you go under definitions yeah right and you just outline what you prohibit what you choose to allow well this talks about marijuana Social Clubs I don't think there's any Social Clubs anywhere in the state of Maine so Ian that's language that what is a marijuana Social Club I don't I don't know but I've got Visions in my head yeah that be like would that be like would they call it a bake shop I would assume so and you might want toate a different type of get baked so as far as wording what do you guys what do you guys think well I think there needs to be some wording in there simply because we have such a clear definition in the state around medical dispensaries and um recreational establishments so I just think we should follow that language that's used in the state the first line the purpose of this ordinance is to prohibit retail marij on establishments and retail marij on Social Clubs well in the corporate limits of Fort Fairfield okay I think whatever we put in there for wording on it be on the first line make it clear what do you think what do you think P well I mean it's it's we want this m this ordinance completely says nothing about any retail in the town of Fort Fairfield so there can be no retail sales whether it's for a medical facility or a recreational facility so so it's to prohibit retail sales of marijuana through medical dispensaries or recreational establishments yeah so so we had this ordinance already that that was drawn up back in 17 yeah 17 and when did we vote on this and eliminate it is it November was that I i' have to look at November is when the discussion related to the of an ordinance for sales was first discussed at least the earliest I could find it yeah so it was like December or January I think that we voted on it yeah and had a public hearing it was after well it it was after it was yeah when you and I were in yeah we were here yeah I think it was even later than that time flies what would be your recommendation as far as the wording here like how you you just want to you just want to say like the purpose of theorder to prohibit sales of yeah I was going to just research the language being used I me clearly it isn't the only prohibition out there yeah so okay I'm a big fan of finding the the best verbiage and using it yeah somebody else has put some time into the legal on this yeah yeah that's my personal I I haven't I haven't read any I wouldn't have yeah we can just well we'll do that then yeah there's only one he's he's going to research the proper way to word it yeah I can look at some language okay you something to propose to look at okay the other thing to to make note of is under four it talks about not just retail but it also talks about wholesale and that's the only place in this that it mentions um wholesale where's online for there no personal organization so developer operate a business that engages in retail or wholesale sales the next line down says nothing in this ordinance is intended to prohibit any lawful use possession conduit the main yeah so it means you can go out of town and buy it and bring it back yeah right but this one is talking wholesale sales or retail so I think there's a difference between that too so yeah maybe person orgel yeah yeah yeah research language yeah yeah it's it's I've been married 21 years and I still would have been able to read that yeah so I knew where it was coming yeah it's a tough one it is all right you good I'm good I'm good this might be a do I need a motion to adjourn yes yes I do I'll second it okay all those in favor I I got to put this pen back I got it I'm really surprised that all these people that are against it didn't show up for this Workshop yeah what's your stance on it Dan totally against it",True

is the flag of the United States of America and to the rep for it stands one nation under God indivisible okay so uh public comment period's open uh three minutes come to the podium state your name and I'd just like to also let everybody be aware but there's a public comment period at the end okay Tim you got the floor fantastic thank you uh so we'll start off with our corresponden and reports uh the September financial statements uh I sent along the general ledger the review summary and the expense summary uh about a quar of the way through the fiscal year and our financial Outlook continues to Trend towards the positive uh cash flow has remained strong uh we did dip into our tax anticipation note uh to the tune of about $50,000 at the end of the month of September uh the payment of additional $250,000 on the line of credit was made in early September so that that pinched our cash flow sum uh but the trade off an interest rate in total debt service made taking the funds from the tan a net positive for the town when it comes to Total interest paid uh the final $250,000 payment on the line of credit will be made in December or January depending on how tax collections roll in and they've been rolling in pretty good so far uh this month expenses remain on budget uh salaries running slightly higher than budgeted across the board uh Sav for a few different uh departments Public Works where they've been down and employeed uh continuing to dig into why some of these things are running a little bit higher than projected uh we know we have some reimbursements coming on the police department we know Rec's higher because of uh just the way Staffing works in the summertime um the one other cost that just continues to be higher than than projected and it is a little bit concerning is our electricity consumption uh and energy costs certainly be something we'll be monitoring through the course of the winter uh because we'll be using more of it um so yeah excise tax continues to be good on the collections and uh as I noted marriage licenses are running ahead of production so that's I guess positive so I think's not de uh we okay on the financial report okay yep I don't know what how to transition to the next one so I'll just if you want me to stop or answer ask questions feel free uh the next item on reports would be rusic SP Solutions um I attended last month's uh board meeting with Dan our Mr reesy was unable to attend um we did a full review of arus solutions current finances and income in the landfill is currently ahead of budget projections and uh expenses running below budget which is awesome uh that said plenty of discussion about areas concern and this will sound like a bit of a theme uh issues with Staffing costs and energy costs are probably what are constraining and concerning them most in their budget as well uh construction of the new two cells is progressing but still behind schedule due the weather and given those challenges final completion of the two cells has been pushed to Mid November uh the last item that they were looking at is getting final approval for the lure of the press transfer station which could come at any time uh which is kind of surprising given that it was a landfill um but they're still operating the facility while they wait final license approval and uh we expect to get the first look at their proposed budget for next year uh at their meeting on Friday October 27th any questions for Tim in regards to ro way Solutions okay uh we got Public Public Works director's report evening councilors got a few things you have any questions certainly jump in anytime uh as Tim mentioned we are uh we're currently short one employee but we do have that employee hired he'll start uh around November 1st which will make us fully staffed for the first time in a couple of years uh a couple of our our plow operators this winter will be new so please bear with us at the beginning uh it's a pretty steep learning curve for them you know you really can't start training until you get right into the thick of winter and you know um we are fortunate though to be staffed as well as we are there are other municipalities in even the state that are down 50% you know 40% on Staffing so I feel pretty good about where we're at feeling pretty good about going into the winter uh fortunately our Sand's head we we've just uh topped off our winter sand we brought in 3,000 yards of sand we're all set there uh equipment you know we've had a lot of discussion about equipment our equipment isn't getting any newer but we've we've spent a lot of time a lot of money um we have the equipment so it is certainly safe and it is as reliable as you can make so we're we're doing pretty well all of our major issues at this point are taken care of currently we're just working on lighting and that sort of things last but not least uh Paving uh we we had planned to start Paving in the middle of September unfortunately due to weather it has put the the Paving Company behind fortunately all the equipment showed up on Forest Avenue spent the afternoon marking out the job we will start Paving in the morning and luckily we have the weather to do it in in June this probably would have taken us two days we're probably going to have four three or four into it but it looks like we have that three or four days to get this project done any questions so uh you are you GNA have parttime guys this wi we are you are yes uh currently we have three part- timers um and that's going to make a huge difference for us there we're going to use a a couple of th those guys that they do not have CDLs they'll be in those F550 till we purchase Oh I wanted to mention that as well those trucks are all on site the one that we went to Vermont to get is in very good shape had no issues with it on the trip home an eight hour trip uh the equipment really looks great on it the truck itself looks looks really nice I think some of you have seen it yeah um looking forward to want everybody to remember those those truck aren't the answers to all of our issues they aren't going to take care of all of our needs they'll certainly fill in a spot any more questions for Darren that's going to help on your overtime having the part time guys right certainly will yeah y thank you Darr thank you okay the uh Libby Brook beavers update sounds like a basketball team doesn't it so the uh just a quick update uh we had discussed this at the September council meeting had to hire a Trapper to remove several beavers uh that had built some dams out in the vicinity of liby Brooky Roseville Avenue so uh good news is the Trapper was very successful in removing 10 beavers the downside is comes at a cost of 150 bucks per Beaver uh so that $1,500 to pay for that we had to take from the administrative Reserve account um just a quick note on that it isn't something that we budget but it's something that we run into considerable amount of with considerable frequency um so it was a discussion that maybe we should add some sort of line notem to maybe track what some of those costs are and I don't believe this is the only uh nuisance animal removal cost that we had in this months boring as well I believe there's some on the west Limestone Road as well so just something that we need to keep an eye on so uh the next update I had for you folks was related to the land for entry modernization project which will be coming in the next few years uh this brand new border crossing for the US side of the Border will be about a 35 to $45 million project uh the project is already away with some contracts awarded for environmental review and for construction management consulting just wanted to make you folks aware that there is a meeting on next Wednesday October 25th from 6: to 7:30 at the high school C CA eteria uh there'll be quite a crew of folks from Boston coming up uh from the general Services uh Administration to discuss the project the impacts I believe they're going to be meeting with some of the Area Property Owners as well to talk about some of the concerns that they have so detach the uh the flyer in your packet any questions related to that it's exciting project it's several years in the the process and um replacing a old but historical building so uh the next item I had under uh correspondence and reports was just a resignation uh we received a resignation letter from Jason Barnes as a member of the budget advisory committee uh so I'd like to just take a second and thank Jason publicly for his commitment to serving our town these past four decades both as a councilman and as a member of the budget advisory committee uh I've attached a letter of his uh resignation from the and uh the last item I kind of put into under here was some Community uh realizing fully that all of our residents have access to the internet uh that they don't have um you know social media opportunities just wanted to make folks aware that the the gym is now open for winter hours uh for walking from 700 to noon uh so as long as folks bring some uh indoor sneakers and not wear their outdoor boots or sneakers the gym is open to use most days safe for when the gym is in use for voting or other events uh and then I did want to provide an update related to the fall FunFest

experience that in the past the bid approach has only led us to receive low bids uh when outright sale is netted us about three times the amount of the bids um with your approval we would bypass the bid process and do a direct sale uh netting the T somewhere near between maybe eight to $10,000 for this Surplus Cruiser so move second motion and second any discussion all those in favor Fort Fairfield Authority commissioner appointment the uh we received a letter from Stacy Mish the executive director of the for f Housing Authority the letter is attached in the packet seeking to nominate

club pretty much prepares the grant it just authorizes us to be the the receiver of those funds and pass us to the club for grooming costs maintenance and what have you um so we would seek Council approval to assist the snowmobile club in that manner like a motion motion I second motion second any discussion all those in favor I I I Okay police grants Police Department absolutely so Chief Cummings continues to do a great job with his department and also great job I also seeking ways to reduce the cost of the department to taxpayers and residents uh and he was very successful in some of his recent Grant applications uh and I'll just highlight them briefly uh he was awarded or the department was awarded a $300 Grant from Harbor Freight Tools to upgrade items in the police department's garage a 1,29 $6 uh Grant award uh for the planed upgrade of the department body cameras from the burn Jag Grant and a $2,600 award from the Walmart Foundation which will be also used to upgrade equitment used by the officer uh we would recommend approving the acceptance of all three of those Grant Awards so move second okay second or Matt very very nice work on that yeah go to vote hi hi hi hi okay town office holiday closures so it's day 12 for me in this chair and I'm already seeking to close the town office down and take breaks I apologize um but as discussed in the uh you know in the community uh empowerment project um one of the goals or one of the one of the issues I guess identified was that um there's been some lack of communication and cooperation amongst departments I'll be honest I don't see that in my quick time here I think everybody does a great job of working together but part of that communication and cooperation comes from um building relationships and fellowship historically the town has held a Thanksgiving uh dinner for staff I'll also invite usually counselors uh members of the water district uh but so that everybody can attend at the same time we've historically closed uh from 11:00 to1 to allow folks to attend uh so we'd be seeking to close the town office from 11:00 to1 on Wednesday November 15th and in similar fashion the town is historically held a Christmas party and I and I do want to knowe these parties come at no cost to the town uh the different departments for the uh Thanksgiving meal bring a dish um and then for the town Christmas party it's a pop luck event uh that would be held December 20th from 11: to1 on that one a little bit smaller scale it's usually office staff and a few of the other folks in various departments from around um the community um like I said it's not quite the retreat as outlined in the community empowerment project um but it is these little things that not only help with morale but relationship building and I would seek approval to have the town office closed at those two times so moved motion second y any discussion no all those in favor I I great thank you very much okay I a a late addition to your agenda so if you're working off an old one uh I know the the ones out on the docket have it uh item J which would be the community resilience partnership Grant I did put a um piece of paper on each of your stations meeting and I I realized you may not have had time to review so I'll review it a little bit so the town received a grant under the Community resilience partnership Grant from the governor's office I believe those funds were received Antonio correct me if I might because he's got a a steel trap for a mine was it in 21 or 22 we received These funds 22 okay so it's no December 21 December 21 Okay so we' we've had these funds for some time uh the goal is to use these funds for initiatives that would impact uh Community functions that could be impacted by climate change uh the town was awarded $88,500 to replace the sutron on the pump station down at the pump house on Main Street on the D um by upgrading and replacing this piece of equipment uh we'll be able to remotely monitor River levels which will not only save Staffing time but money uh and allow us to um unfortunately not control it remotely but at least know if somebody needs to be there to control it uh so I would seek Council permission to use these funds that have been set aside in the administrative Reserve account and also to expend the additional funds uh the council approved in the November 2022 meeting uh the use of these funds for this purpose we just want to make sure we're approved to spend them now that the uh project has been done and the equipment's been upgraded so move

somebody else said can't ask for the podium just to speak to them it's not a place for debate and I'm not going to allow it okay can't debate with me either it's not my job I'm just here to Mo moderate it the meeting as posted and comments and re question questions should be directed to the town manager oh he goes on the bus again purpose of this hearing is to allow for public comments on the following is there anybody who would like to begin the comment period Mr trit um just to start with I was kind of surprised that all of a sudden one of the that we had kind of disappeared about not having marijuana shops in Fort Fairfield um evidently nobody attended the public hearing that was held um at that time so they voted to take take away that ordinance I moved here 25 years ago longest I've ever lived anywhere I know just about just about everybody in the room uh but uh I worked I selected Fort Fairfield for my home with my children and family because of its family values and thought it' be a good RA place to raise my children to rest for the time frame that they're going to stay with me they're both in high school by the time we got here um I'm against marijuana shops I don't think Fort Fairfield needs one um there are plenty of places in ARA County uh to buy marijuana if they so choose to buy marijuana and I think uh the process that we're going through establish an ordinance that might eventually allow marijuana shops in Fort Fairfield is something that I do not support um spent uh 21 years with rotary uh 25 years I remember I've been here 25 years and I spent 25 years here with the Historical Society thanks to my father-in-law who voted me in in secretary when I wasn't even a member um and another uh let's see 20 21 years with d Columbus now I just those are my feelings I know they not everybody's feelings but they are mine thank you Mr Monte good evening I'm George Monty and I have been a resident in Fort Fairfield for over 37 years I retired from the health care profession after 44 years as a result of that experience I know about marijuana in regard to its effect on the human body both good and bad I'm also a recovering addict and by the grace of God I have been cleaned for almost 25 years as a result of that personal experience I have lost close friends to suicide and are overdose Fort Fairfield is a port of entry for our nation and I do not think the Cannabis shops lining Main Street makes the best first impression for visitors for several reasons such as increased motor vehicle accidents higher inance of chemical dependence to a broader range of drugs comprom compromised morality and the general harm to society to name a few I do not believe that it is in the best interest of Fort Fairfield to permit the sale of can in our town u i I looked into it in question number one in 2016 even though in the state of Maine it was 50.26548 74 4% against very close um in Arista County it was 36.7 2% in favor of legalization of marijuana for recreational use and 63 . 28% against and more specifically for Fort Fairfield 684 votes for the legalization 989 almost a thousand against so at that particular time majority of the residents were against the legalization of marijuana uh and then just one last thing um a lot of the shops you see the Green Cross and I am certainly not in favor of the green cross that you see displayed on these shops um Maine has an approved symbol a triangle with a cannabis leaf um and the Green Cross um I think if for Fairfield was to make the mistake of allowing shops to open here at the very least they should prohibit the Green Cross uh Christ the King died on a cross for our Salvation not to Pedal weed thank you for permitting me to express my opinion Mr Monty if you would leave your written notes with her make it easier for her to transcribe the minutes if you don't mind if you want it back or a copy of it would anybody else like to add to comments yes please name two okay I'm super nervous I've never been to a town council meeting this is not a Town Council not or anything like this sorry okay feel relaxed public opinion meeting I've never been can't make mistakes okay my name is roxan rust I've lived here for three years um I moved here because Fort Fairfield just seems so friendly and family orientated and just I'm against marijuana shops in our town um my son is 15 he walks this town every day after school with his friends um he visits lots of the shops he goes to the um Parks um I just think it's the wrong thing I I just we need I know that it'll bring lots of Revenue um for the town and I know that we need money um but I think there's other avenues we could explore and other ways we could try to get businesses to come and stay and I don't think it should be marijuana and I just yeah I don't know I probably I wish I would have thought it out and written something so eloquent I'm doing fine I'm doing fine but I just don't think it should be here there's seven of them in presle why do we need one I mean I know we need the money but why do we need that but yeah so that's my opinion I'm against thank you thank very much is there anybody else that would like to speak about the ordinance either for or against sorry Mr reesi Jake reesi um honestly I'm not in favor of the ordinance poops in Fort if we do get to where that is allowed I don't think Main Street should be allowed um I know that car has one that is outside of City Limits um if we go that route I'd like to see them outside of city limits in the industrial park just not on Main Street thank you is there anybody else that would like to make comments for the record I guess I could I'm pat pat try and I just want to say I agree with everything that everybody has said I am against marijuana in the town thank you thank you before I close this hearing I want to reiterate the fact that the next town council meeting is scheduled for October oober 18th at 6: p.m. any comments or questions that anybody might have can be sent to the town manager Tim gof and he will pass it along to the council if in the right format it's just a whisper in in the dark someplace while I'm but we we do have those options to table it or amend it approve it or deny it as is and uh unless somebody else has a comment or wants to reiterate or retract anything that they've said this is the time I'm going to close the public hearing it being 614 thank you all for coming thank you here's your Cy back,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,aEvBTQA8B8Q,"September 20, 2023 Regular Town Council Meeting",,90.0,5413.0,2023-09-21T18:17:34Z,none,173,0,0,0,I have no idea [Music] okay I'd like to thank everybody for coming out tonight six o'clock look at the meeting started uh all councils are present besides Mr Pelletier like to ask Tony to lead us in prayer we pray for our country at all times that all citizens are safe healthy and happy we pray for wisdom for all those who guide and govern help this government body in every situation to know and to do the things that are right and just the soundness of judgment in making vital decisions we pray for the peacemakers of the Holy life-given Spirit May ever dwell in their hearts and the barriers of fear suspicion and hatred may fall this we pray to the Holy Father amen amen of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty justice for all thank you okay okay uh public comment period dress us from the podium state your name okay Dan Tim you get the floor thank you um correspondence and reports under license and permits we've had children noodles the VFW in Canterbury Royale and we had one catering the County Farms market which was a successful Friday in Fort Pierce that that we'll be talking about uh so um and I signed all those on behalf of council uh is the 2016 police second [Music] follow any questions or comments all in favor aye okay great thank you uh just for something we discussed but uh standard practice is at least it has been for me is that if it's a renewal or something like a one shot deal that the child manager can sign on behalf of the council if it's a new license then it comes to the council and the council gets a chance to talk about it and then vote on it and then you folks will be signing it so that's kind of the practice that and I've shared that with him so it makes sense we haven't really talked about it but [Music] um financial report so you folks uh saw the financial report that I sent out to you this budget advisory committee uh we're two months into the year um and you know all in all things are there's no really big surprises uh it has been we were able to in August to be able to pay an additional 250 000 on the whole line of credit which leaves a balance and now 250 000 which hopefully will be paid by the end of December uh and that will be mercifully gone so we've had a very strong cash balance and that was not something that I really anticipated um we have not had to utilize our tan yet even though that I cut teeth out here right after the Fourth of July to get that thing signed so then because I was afraid we're going to need it in July and we haven't used it yet uh though I do want to tell you I haven't had to use it but Tim is going to I can't really say too much about that but as the Nuketown manager he's a rewarding some money and did you feel a bus to one box yeah amazing how many tires yeah and um so we have we listen we we've done really well yeah and um you know we I felt I did a cash flow uh analysis that we do every year I look like we're gonna need about a million dollars I thought we were going to need it for probably about six months um or seven it looks like I'm estimating that we might use a maximum of 650 000 would be probably for about three months so uh all in all uh you know we're saving a lot of money in interest costs that we budgeted that will be I'm sure something that we will have for someplace else but um that that part of the financial picture has worked out really well uh the expenses were all in line uh salaries are a little high because we had three pay periods in August and that will obviously uh level out um I I do think electricity can use continues to be an issue and uh you know we made adjustments in our budget I don't know if we've made enough um and it's too early to tell but it is something that uh something that Tim's going to need to keep an eye on this or moving forward um the work department was a little high but that was due to some of the programs in the pool and that will level up as we go through the year so I didn't really see anything other than that in the expense side our revenues have been have been great uh I I have no idea what's going on with Texas tax collections but July was a big month uh in August months as well both months where so we so that was good um the homestead exemption payment which we got in August and I shared a little bit that with Tim today was abnormally high in uh I could spend 50 minutes talking as to why um I I did talk about it a little bit here in if you guys uh would like to further explore that I'll be happy to share it with you but in any event because of it we received um a healthy payment two payments in August which really increased our income beyond what I normally wouldn't normally expect to see so anyway all in all uh we are starting uh this fiscal year in pretty good shape I see no reason why it's not going to continue anybody have any questions on any of that let's get it um I only using my Solutions I did give you folks I gave them a copy of the business plan and um yeah I really like I but I found destructive in there is the amount of license space that we have license phase is not easy to get anymore and we've got a lot of it a lot available for the communities in Aristo County and I just thought that that was the story more than what I realized between the two landfills and prescotta Ford so that's it's a good thing it really is anyway just wanted to share that well and and I'll stress the point that there was some skepticism when we were looking at this merger but that was the boy's intention from the beginning of the merge it was lingualistic too right acquire as much of that license space as we can so uh we always feel good about the merger what we like to express the positive things that come from when they do because there was some skepticism in all of the three towns that we're working into work with Prescott time so all right it's worked out very well and we've had good leadership to get us here so we've been really lucky our last meeting was August 25th we went over the July income statements uh our income was a little low in July about 4.7 below budget but our year today is only two percent below budget so we figured that's going to get caught up to it our biggest customer is is uh to sell a country coming out of voting area uh and they're contracted to bring a minimum amount no matter what so even if we don't get in July we'll get it before the end of the year or they just pay us and don't ring it which is all right so um it's a good moderate contract that we have with them our expenses were are expensive with 13 lesson we had budget so that's a good number for us to have and overall our our liabilities in reserves are we're funded at the end of July around 98 so we feel free to run that um an update on sales five and six uh we were given a report from Saud Brook is our main construction company for that up again but they looking at substantial completion date around November 1st uh we may not be necessarily ready to use it by then supposed to refilling the old cells but that seems to be on track even though they've had a lot of weather problems there as well now they've been very good about playing ketchup without an extra expense to us we're very pleased with that and the bond Bank approved our loans for the bonds for sales five and six of producer standpoint we're in pretty good shape but that's going to Prescott transfer station is up and running uh we haven't had any problems with that it's been up and running for about eight or nine weeks now the only thing that we're missing is our actual profit from the dep and Mark is doing some repeats so research to find out why that is but we were licensed for a landfilling having the license for a transfer station is quite a lot less intensive so we think we qualify our own problems um and then we looked at the Strategic plan and we made some follow-ups to that and if you see any questions on a strategic plan or you want to have an input on something that we're doing there please feel free to call me or Dan or uh our meetings over to the public you're welcome to come to the meetings any other questions thank you very much thanks Steve thanks Steve Tony is uh a little talk about his practice Assessor's role um I'm gonna talk generally about this testing I'm not talking about specifically what's happening right now since the rebound and the rebound was put in place for taxes that were collected after April 1st 2020. and every year I have to take all the sales analysis called the turnaround document and somehow rank the sales from the closest to 100 percent to the furthest away from 100 percent and then that turnaround document goes into the state and there's a two-year lag as you know for how it impacts the community so 2020 we were because of the sales ratio analysis that we did at the time of the uh uh redial we were able to certify at 100 percent 2021 because of the what we were doing to monitor the market sales of the community we were able to certify it 100 percent 2022 we were able to also certify it 100 you see at the bottom of that page where it says certified ratio for 2023. they're going to allow us to certify for these tax bills at 100 percent now here comes what what this this report shows me report of assessment review if you look to only call them out on the right where it says aroostick combined sales ratio 88 percent is the best we can do I cannot find argument I use 25 sales or more of what I'm submitting and then they do their math their formulas and then they tell me what our certified or our what our sales ratio is then you can certify within 10 of your sales ratio 10 of 88 is nine if you round up they rarely let you round up they say if you're at 88 then you're going to get eight and that gives you 96. how that impacts this town is three or four fold first thing is you can't tax everybody at 100 if you're not certified at 100 this directly impacts all the personal property and you're only supposed to assessed at your sales ratio so let's say you're at 96 which means four percent off the top lowers your value you lower the value raises the mill rate you also have to there are three exemptions four exemptions that are correctly impacted by your certified ratio homestead exemption you can't give them 100 percent which means you're only going to give them 96 at best based on the sales ratio there's a thousand people in this community that get the Homestay exception plus or minus one a thousand we have over a hundred veterans here in Fort Fairfield and you can't give them 100 an exemption you can but when the reimbursement comes the state's done their audit and they say you shouldn't certified at 100 you shouldn't give them 100 and they remember what happened several years ago they clogged back all the reimbursement Monies to a level that we were allowed if you have blind exemptions and a couple of others and one of the values that is directly impacted and we don't have a lot of value in it but you must tax your certified tree growth in any other protected sheltered property like the windmills like the solar Farms they're all protected they're under a classification and you can't give them a hundred percent of value so that's a deduct so every deduct they'll reiterate every deduction value raises your mill rate you're going to see communities like Holton in the news yesterday announced that they are going to do statistical factoring across the board based on what they need what they found out and almost every Community up here including Eastern which had two revalves in the last 10 years is gonna has had to do two statistical factors I'm proposing that we use the software available to us through the rebal company that's there and we factor to the maximum amount across the board not classifications not because it's water body it's not because it's Farmland not because it's residential not because it's commercial it's in this community it's affected by the ratio so therefore we'll Factor across the board what that does is raise your value you still need the same amount of money it lowers the mill rate so that's what I'm proposing that I work on uh for the rest of the year is to how we do it and what's the best number so I spoke to both Mr Foster and I spoke to the person in charge of this at Mrs main Revenue Services and she and I have been working together on these type of issues for over 30 years and she agrees with me that that's fixed to the issue that's going on in the market analysis in rooster County It's Not Just Sports Fairfield it's every single Community since covid started in the old migration from the cities and the state larger States they sell big out there and they see a nice house here and it's peanuts to them is a tenth of what they sold their property from and they had a shaft right plus they got some land and services and they're not on top of each other so the market is almost countywide impacted an extreme example is today my most recent sale was assessed at sixty seven thousand dollars I'll let one of you guess how much it was you already know so you can't guess anybody got a guess how much over Market was this sold if the mark it is the market it's over assessment which we certified at 100 last year with two hundred thousand dollars surprise you no drop my jaw for a sixty seven thousand dollar home when we suppose here at market value right yeah yeah but I I strongly recommend that this community that's a factoring town wide right it should not affect anybody's individual Bill more or less than another person's I agree it's easy to do the math right values go up no rate comes down yeah you take away all your reimbursements and the percentage of your reimbursements you have most cash to work with you got to raise more cash you got less value you've got to raise the mill rate so that's what I'm going to propose that my assessment office works on over the next I have until March I have a lot of time to try to calculate what's the best number for us to rest on for the long future I don't want to do this six years in a row like some communities you know so that they can stay at 100 okay any questions on that I just had one calling it and that is I think Tony's right on the mark in in one of the things that that that can happen when when a revalue or indexing is done is that it is so easy to increase expenditures to cover it and then blame the rebound right I think what's really important you cannot oversize over emphasize transparency so I think Joni's what Tony is talking about is exactly the direction that this community should go I just think that we're just going to have to share this 10 different ways right so that people can feel comfortable with what's happening and then they're not going to see another big joke in their taxes yeah that really is I mean I think people are still you know it's still antsy about what's happened in the past and but I mean Tony has a very legitimate problem and I think that his solution makes a whole lot of sense oh my gosh yeah thank you so I'm going to continue to do the math and I have a sales ratio study that I have to submit for 2025 okay 2024 will be the one we we're going to have to factor for right I have to submit the sales ratio information after our tax bills well this year because I want to use that commitment book right to maximize because we had all these pickups all right from our quarterly review that we did this summer I want to make sure I have the highest value in all sales and that way I can even it a little bit without even before the factor right yeah but Dan knows I scrutinize every sale here yeah that's my job absolutely any other questions or the comments no I like your idea Tony okay thank you thank you not an easy time it's not usually undertaking either so Pat Main Street revitalization you guys are humming really long aren't you yeah well we're about ready to take a little Hiatus but we did the last um Friday's Friday in Fort for the year we held an event out at Farm park because once again big storms were projected for Friday night so instead of trying to reschedule we just we we just moved the venue out to Farm Park it was a wonderful wonderful night there really was we had good attendance with the food trucks and the vendors were all there we had County Farms come in and we had a beer garden and that was well attended there was I mean people just seemed to have a really good time we had music live music good food lots of good people out around it was it was a really good night um I heard a lot of positive things we were proud of it I don't think we're going to do another one until February we think um because there's stuff going on the town is the parks and recs is doing October something happening in October there's something happening in November and then we're going to have the light parade in December so and I don't know who wants to do anything in January so but uh I think it's great it was a wonderful event there is a there's going to be a quality Place council meeting on the 25th you guys plan on attending that yeah yeah that would be an ongoing thing folks will be doing that yes great questions uh comments I've heard nothing but positive things I really did well I mean I can't take a whole lot of credit for it because I mean we talked about it but Elizabeth and Bree did a lot of the work so yeah yeah you've got a good girl yeah Charlie sear is not around and he he was he was not there for that so we noticed that he was missing it was just a really great great really great night great turnout I've heard positive things yes worked out really well very well that's great nothing but positive comments on the venue really tickets out there and I won three times he did I won three times something oh seriously yeah it was like go buy a lottery ticket yeah yes he did good for you uh okay uh ld1 Tax Liberty limit calculation I thought I would do this uh for this year we are going to be folks are going to be voting for the new bill rate uh Which tax bills were going out here and uh 10 days or so so we're going to be starting that process um I do want to say that I I really do think that this is a good exercise I really do I think I think it's appropriate in um it it's the intent is not to um determine what your expenditure should be the intent is to make people understand that when you take into consideration the increase in valuation you take into consideration what the inflation rate is that the amount of money that you're asking is probably more than it should be so then you just simply say okay so why it could be some very good legitimate reasons why but it makes you ask the question and so that's the whole example um the other the other thing is is that the intent is to compare operations to operations so the amount of money it takes to operate the child in one year compared to the amount of money it takes to operate the town in the subsequent year but it doesn't take into consideration or what it's not meant to take into consideration is some of the things that we've had to deal with the last two years so when you're looking at trying to pay off 1.3 million dollars in short-term debt that has nothing to do with operations and you should not be utilizing uh this this process to say well if you're going to be over because of that then that means you're going to cut Public Works by 250 000 in the police department by a hundred thousand or whatever it is um so what I did here is I I didn't utilize the budget that was approved last year I utilized what we spent that's the number that I use and I compared it to the number that we're going to spend this year and so we've got the amount of money that we're going to that we spent last year to operate this town we get the amount of money that you approved in this year's budget that we're going to spend this year and when you compare those and you can factor in the inflation rate and factoring the increase in the um uh any other income that we receive um and uh uh the uh the increase in the full evaluation thank you so when you do all that what you find is when you look at the form as I completed it is that we are 162 000 over or under what we would be allowed to spend but what it does do is that it sets a new property tax levy limit that which is 162 000 less than what would have been allowed based upon the expenses that we spent last year so we could have spent we we could have spent four million 696 000 to stay under the limit we actually are spending 4 million 53. so we're 162 000 under that so if that doesn't require a voting the council but it is certainly something that you need to know and be aware of and that this you know this you're going to know that by this form being completed which hasn't been done for since I'm this year has never been done so anyway um does anybody have any you I sent you all that information does anybody have any questions about that concerns uh so and you know this is something that Tim will be doing next year for the 24-25 budget and uh we'll be we'll be talking about it again so anyway that is that Tim Tim and I uh met with Olympia with Olympia sales with Susan Collins office on congressionally directed spending we don't call them earmarks anymore the congressionally corrected spending uh is a good good opportunity for us this again with Bernard Kent who's a member of Senator Collins team in in Augusta in Washington DC uh really the takeaway that that we took from it is if we have projects that we want to see receive funding through congressionally directed spending we need to be proposing them not one the the grand period opens but when we have those projects because the uh the timeline kind of moves based on when Congress settings budget and when you know even though the fiscal year runs you know October to October um when they put the call out for these proposals could vary and so realistically what they had asked us to do or advise this to do is if we have a project bring it forth have them vet it now so that it's ready uh basically shovel ready when Congressional you know when the Appropriations Committee meets and then if it has the backing if Senator Collins another and then the votes of Congress we may see somebody so that was really the the gist of what they put forth to us is if we've got proposals bounce them off them and if and if it fits they'll bring It Forward it was a good meeting a lot of real good opportunity especially given Uh current status as the vice charity Appropriations any questions is there any uh is there any projects that you and Dan might have schemed up or anything that where we could utilize I mean certainly utilizes funding we've been successful in the past with the Utilities District yeah um I think there's a couple different avenues that we could be looking at if we looked around at what other communities doing in arusta County we can see the police new police station and Caribou was an example the Public Works facility in Washburn is another funded example but there's historical preservation to infrastructure to roads working through Maine DOT they're the largest recipient of CDs funding in the state um they did kind of steer away from recreational sorry Dad um but that isn't to mean recreational from the sense of like Community projects like Parks or bigger projects that might have more more of an economic development front I want to say there was seven or nine different Congressional departments that have funding that pollen did CDs um and really that was the whole point if you get an idea and bounce it to them they'll bet it if it makes sense then then they'll tell you to kind of move forward in that vein it doesn't increase spending from Congress but it does kind of set aside funding that's already been appropriated and then it makes it so that then you apply for the grant and kind of already have a foot in the door for that Grant that's kind of how I understood it I'd be open to your interpretation of it it's complex and it's kind of a moving Target because it depends on who's in Congress and what priorities are which you might you might think it's a public works project but it might fit better under interior to so that's a lot of why they suggested if we just keep an open line of communication with them we would have better success you know they were very receptive to hear from us things that we're interested in as Tim said somewhere around them later um and I think also they try to stress that this is a unique opportunity to be able to take advantage of Senator Carl's decision right so if if you have a knee and it fits in one of these silos paper pizza and speak up because she is very very supportive and um and her staff is the reason why Brandon came up from from Washington uh so yeah I think it's um I think it's it's a great opportunity um looking for uh looking for a need I think we need to look for some needs yeah really I mean I think we need to start to look and see what right because absolutely the needs in the community are many anything else um as far as to tell me an interest transition is concerned you can see here and I are here uh we've been needing on a fairly regular basis we've been to some meetings together um we're talking about the transition process so you know Tim has a good feel for the local government as he's been here so he understands it and the other thing is is that you know Chen is met with with the Department of heads the department of meeting Jim was here and um he's we're really fortunate because we really have a solid staff and every department is well run and they they know the department has no other job and they do it well and they work well together so that's going to be a huge Advantage for Tim I know it's a huge Advantage for me when I came here after being out of it for 10 years so I'm feeling confident I feel very very confident about Tim being able step in in I think it's going to be like the fire hose is just going to open up at 100 PSI it's going to be a lot of stuff at once but right I know Tim's gonna be able to handle it there is one thing that I just like to mention to the council is that you know it's been fine for me uh actually I've been here a little bit longer than I thought I would be I've been here a year but I didn't tell that the furniture and that office is awful it is disgusting it is what you would find in a throwaway pile that Gardens now I don't know what happened to the Quality Furniture I had when I left in 2013 and I honestly think it's the Toby's office my personal feeling that that is not the case uh so I you know a lot here suggesting that we do something today but please don't be surprised when Tim comes to you and say look we need to like a little money how did the administrative Reserve to to put some the the desk is not functional I think you need something better than that and the furniture is just every time I open a pick or dance and I just wait for it to fall on the floor I mean it's just really bad so anyway I just throw that out there um uh just so at some point I'm sure Tim will be coming to you so you know do we have to wait um only to the extent that I think Tim needs to get settled and figure out what it is that he wants um I mean when we spend a lot of money right it it needs to look better than what it does and we need something that doesn't certainly needs to be more practical it's just not a practical desk at all and the the quality of the product is just um so the chairs in there horrify me every time there's a whole material that I've used it in yes yeah that was the uh the chief oh yeah [Laughter] nope okay um I put this hair homeowner assistance fund um I put this on the agenda because it is it's an example of what I would say department head over above and beyond um you know there's been an ongoing concern that with the with the with the mind-boggling increase again in taxes that it is hard for everybody but there are some people that it's more than just hard and um and Ella has been keeping an eye on this she keeps an eye on the accounts receivable or accounts receivable on and so she's been reaching out to people and talking to them about this program and I think that we are closest out here now I expected of course the second October who will have taken in over 60 000.60 from the happy birthday well so that has helped out a lot of people and and it is all because Ella took the initiative to reach out to those folks and say you need to talk to Ian oh here's the phone number give her a call and has been very receptive she has worked with people there are people who don't have computers you can't get online and do the necessary forms and does it for them anyway between the two of them uh they have just helped a lot of citizens support Fairfield deal with this with this tax liability that they've had so I just wanted to I just wanted to um just point it out to you guys um you know we've got people that really do care and and really are looking out for the citizens of this community yes it is buy the half program pay in these taxes if those are these major difference when we file foreclosure notices in January because some people would be going into foreclosure and it's also going to make major difference in the links that we place it yeah quite an effect and of course yeah as always so thank you thank you thank you for that thank you for that great work uh so Dan had asked me to provide an update related to the community empowerment project recommendations and where we stand in regards to those and I kind of thought I'd run down through the one through I believe it's seven and just kind of give an idea of where we're at with those so the recommendations were to add a regular standing agenda item to Council meetings for department heads to make a presentation thank you Tony for today um another recommendation was for us to have additional information for new counselors and Niger has taken care of that and for us to also have more of a the word is a retreat but a more organizational meeting with counselors and managers and staff and so we'll work on that at the beginning of the year um another recommendation uh from this process was that we included a public comment period at the end of Council meetings uh and so we'll have one of those at the end of tonight's meeting as well uh another of the recommendations was to include a probationary period and Provisions uh that detailed job duties for the new town manager that has been added to my contract uh other recommendations were for the town attorney to review the town manager's contract before it's finalized and that has been done by Jeff Ashby another recommendation was to amend the town's Charter to amend voting for uh requiring a super majority and that will be part of the item a in Old business tonight where that ordinance will be introduced and the final component was to a recommendation that the Town Council charged the budget advisor committee to work for the Council on adopting a new budget process and that actually will be addressed as well this evening under item e in home business uh so it's just kind of give an idea of how those recommendations are being put into motion any questions components and what about the automated phone system I would love to talk about that phone system I can't tell you how frustrated it is when I want to make a quick phone call and talk to somebody in the town office other than Ella and Tony which I never call and want to talk to Ella and Tony I can't understand why um we have to have an automated answering machine answer the phone I think there are clerks in the office on a regular basis and to get I I wanted I want our town to be seen as a friendly welcoming town and for people either who live in town or away from town for them to call the town office to ask a question or look for for information even to know who to talk to and to get an automated system that gives them two options or stay and wait on the line and listen to this guy drone on for three minutes before you can get anywhere is frustrating it's not welcoming it puts up barriers it's distancing and I think we should change it thank you frustrating and I mean I I don't know what the alternative would be but I know that we have at least three women in the office on a regular basis and several men on a regular basis who could on a rotating basis answer the phone I don't know my suggestion well I think it's legitimate I don't I get frustrated myself no I've got other people well I think that probably I guess what I would recommend is that I do think it needs to be looked at I think staff needs to talk about it and um and I think that uh our new channel manager in my left hand I think our new town manager could what he could do is put together a proposal and bring back your counseling a few folks can look at it and see what you think do you think with that word I think that's a great idea I think staff input is wonderful because again if if I'm going to sit here and say staff should be doing it then staff needs to be involved in agreeing to that and if not if there's a better solution please bring it because it's very frustrating it's very off-putting and it's just it's a barrier and I really think the presentation of Fort Fairfield now from here on out should not be presenting barriers we need to be open for business and friendly yeah I mean whether they answered when the first ranks of whether they answered three minutes later I'd be going through the host field somebody still needs to pick it up oh have you ever called the hospital called The General Hospital phone number kind of like that too that's frustrating it's a bad elevator music it's this guy with this weird voice like if this is an emergency you know it's like I I just think that for Phil can do better I think we need to be friendly and open and welcoming and I think this is the first step that could help yeah little things make a big difference on that thought suggestions we could yeah keep you around for a while to answer that I could answer the phone yeah would be might be a cut and pay it depends on the day okay anything else thank you George I appreciate that um the draft order so hey this is this among other things has been just kind of coming into Croatia right here this week it's really interesting as I can't believe how busy I've been lately it's like I'm trying I'm thinking of what it comes you know the next two weeks and that has not happened at all I mean it's been busy so anyway this is one of the things that I've been dealing with with Sherry and to some extent Giselle um they part of the audit is a management discussion analysis which involves account manager and so I've been working on that with Sherry I just got that completed and got it sent in to her um and so we should be seeing Tim should be seen probably within the next week or so the actual audited financial statement so but there are a couple things that I just would like to mention um even though you don't have the statement to look at uh one is is that it when I went over to I went over last week and met with uh Giselle and with Sherry I was there for two hours and and one of the things that Giselle switch to point out is that at the end of last year our general government fund balance was a negative 575 000. at the end of this year it's 332 000. it's a swing of 970 000 millimeters in one year maybe that's what Giselle says pretty um as a pretty ingredients um especially coming from here yeah well and she said Wanna Be yeah she really does so I mean I think that that seeing the negative fund balance is it's like seeing it's like seeing a negative Network it's um it's not quite a negative network but uh you know I mean I think the fun balance that I left was around 300 000. yeah that was a shame but that happened so anyway so we were able to make a good swing um the actual income exceeding expenses by 991 000. so we say uh million dollars in one year uh in with that million dollars and with the sale of the one of the new ambulances in the ladder truck we actually in in the last fiscal year we've actually paid out the principal and interest payments one million six hundred and ninety five thousand dollars a lot a lot of money so we reduced uh we're we were just going to launch our debt by 550 000 and even more importantly was reducing our yearly debt payments by every 48 000 which is about a year um we still have that one uh loan that's thick enough for working capital you're just gonna pay for you to understand too much about it's 900 000 pounds so it's too bad that we still have it out there but well I'll tell you we've covered a lot of your own in a short period of time we really have um the other thing is that uh I have a real tendency to what I look at a beginning report is what I call it's called schedule work but it's basically basically it's how much money did you take it how much money did you spend to me it's like a cash accounting of what we're doing and what the what they do is they're uh the way they the method of kind of name is is a combination of accrual and modified it's really not a cash so like let me give you an example we took in in a 12-month Epsilon period 434 000 in income from the endings I look at schedule one and it says 374 was actually money that had been generated or the the work had been done in Prior fiscal year in Firestone managers assisted with that um what would be Health receivable detailing towards income so an artificially increased the inline income that we can actually see but I don't like it and um it reduces our income by 57 000 . so it's little things like that that you're kind of working through and the other thing that I really pay attention to is the part of the audit they're responsible to look at the financial systems that we have in place to ensure what I would consider corporate accountability so that you know how are you handling cash are we doing captions you know how is Money Getting deposited into the bank there's a little bit so do they they checked you know how are we doing in terms of our reconciling or checking account how is Ella doing if they're getting some credits you know things being put in the right place so they have this whole process I go through if we're not utilizing proper accounting procedures is they identify it as the material but of business and that also includes whether or not we're doing things according to our governments recent games so um I'm always looking to see whether or not the identify any material immediate skin system that we have in place to ensure that monies are properly available and I can tell you that last year we had two this year uh and um I was really pleased to see that so those are the two things that I really have the things that I really focus on um so Tim will be getting the um would be getting the uh the actual audited statement we'll be getting a few folks you guys will be looking at it and probably will be should be approving it uh accepting it at the October 18th councilman anybody any questions thank you thank you Dave um I just want to update to you saw my little memo on the school speed side um charging us anything so you know we uh hopefully this will meet the needs for the folks on Brunswick Avenue for the kids who are actually walking on the street and so that's all a good thing that's what's taken care of um is it working so far chief what's up a couple of cars there last week so and the sign's there so people oh could happen it hasn't been denied that's right okay so that would be I mean there would be no cost to us it's just that we're just in line with what other people want as well we're hoping for Presque Isle street because that's a problem area as well maybe Columbia and president okay cool um the access point Grant uh for aging project uh is something that just kind of came up on the bloom in quite honestly I really think this has great potential undertale I think we've seen this stuff um that uh that I gave you uh there's a video of us that net with folks from erusic agency or aging they received a grant 880 000 and they're going to use it to set up 20 different access points below the county or Fairfield is one of them and they they're meeting with um the folks from Fort pierrefield senior citizens to find out where would be a good place to put it and so we met uh we're meeting again on the 27th what I'm hoping is is that we can settle in for the library which is what the general consensus of the folks in Fort Fairfield is um as the best place to do that and and work on putting together a memorandum of agreement and get this in place it also with the things that the Librarians are doing because they have other things that they're doing they're reaching out to senior citizens and if libraries people are just getting books uh you know they're doing more and more things right so I I just I see this is just in addition to making it a more useful place for our citizens How would how would that have I guess we'll have to think about that but how would it be affected by the Limited hours of the library does it because um the that that's the they have the beauty of that is that you can block off the upstairs from you downstairs and um and we have uh we have a preservation system which is what this program is used and if they wanted to utilize it uh with ahead of time when the library is not open they your night doesn't matter they can just come in they sign in for it they can keep and then they leave it in the uh chat box so it's worked well we have the sorority does it the ATP Club has done it I mean organizations have done it as well I'm just curious so I was just curious we've used it as well yeah so uh and I do like the system that is in place actually worked for anyone and also the system that is in place is they use they call it they want a champion they're looking for a person who's going to coordinators well we don't have a person we have a system and what in my mind what that does it creates sustained of longevity we can uh we get a system in place so that we don't understand to make sure that the space is being made it's a great idea I agree um under reports I also would like to point uh Darren has been uh well I know if it's there if you might have been fighting to be here but we had a pretty significant problem of adjacent to Roosevelt and uh everything huge huge forward and I find you know if anybody ever get to feel like we just have too many rules and regulations they're very destructive because we deal with well yeah around our place Darren and Darren's got one set oh you checked the vapors yeah well the thing that I find frustrating is that there are rules against even though they're a public Hazard there's a rules against shooting them but it is perfectly fine to pay somebody to come out and trap them and they can take them away and then they can check them that's legal we can't shoot them so it's expensive and um and we have we actually have people in our employment who are trained to shoot things and they don't use their guns very often and so I would think it'd be a great idea great opportunity for them to own their skills we got a counselor that could help them out with that too I think we'll leave defense just just so you know I am a state of Maine Animal Control Management agent by the way so if anything you need support or help I would do that for you Robert you were the man thank you anyway I just want to bring that up the other thing too is is that at some point are you beginning a request from uh Public Works we we have a department head who is using a vehicle that's closing in on 200 000 miles uh he uses it to a check Rose approve three o'clock in the morning windstorms uh I really do think that we need to be looking at some point and finding some kind of a little bit better vehicle for Darren absolutely so anyway that that's something you know Darren and I talked about it I know he's looking for something to use he's not looking to spend a lot of money uh and so at some point I think you might be seeing Tim bringing something to you that they found something that Darren would that would work for him and I think he deserves serious consideration [Music] and I think that's all I had for the reports on file yep okay all business oh new business Opus whole business first yes we need to uh introduce coordinates 2312 which would mend the town Charter regarding uh requiring a super majority vote for uh passing the budget hiring a town manager or borrowing more than 250 000 so Moon there's no one yeah no discussion yeah yeah and we'll put it to the public hearing yeah great we'll set it up here in here shortly thank you we're gonna do the same thing with ordinance 23 13 which is approved in real estate guidelines for general assistance um and the reason why we do that is that when we follow State guidelines anytime we we do utilize general assistance the state will reimburse this is 70. that's it seven seventy percent really so so it is is in our best interest to uh to uh to go through this process to approve the new state guidelines for general assistance appreciate it yeah we also need to introduce ordinance 2314 actually I apologize the major maintenance rolling again it's actually 23 years oh yeah I got it wrong here too all right so so 23-15 to establish adult use in medical marijuana business ordinance that great thank you for that as well uh also under old business uh we set money aside in our reserved it was part of our budget process to purchase the new Cruiser uh this would be Matt's first new Cruiser as our police chief he has found one and um I've given you the information on it so I would ask the council to approve that after purchase the new Cruiser as outlined in the memo that I sent you so moved any questions that hi Jim hi Bob hi bye thank you very much yeah yeah so as alluded to earlier um part of the community empowerment project recommendations was to work on revising the budget process for the fiscal year 24.25 moving forward earlier this month we met with the budget advisory committee to revise a proposed budget process that was presented to us um you know with a goal of more input along the way it has the budget is drafted and the increased involvement of the council and of the advisor committee as the budget is Interactive uh there's an outline that has been provided for your new packet um some of the highlights I would just say is the a questionnaire will be mailed out with the tax bills this year in October um there'll be a workshop in January with Council to help set some budget goals we'll be looking at a expanding Department Workshop process in April where counselors and the budget advisory committee meet with department heads and then really a lot of it falls into place with the with the process as history I don't know we have to I believe we have to improve documents changes to the process so we've got some Move Motion exactly questions comments I'll just say good good work on that Jim yeah good very good work on that uh what okay yeah go to vote Pat aye aye Bob aye great thank you both new business we need to approve the appointments to the budget advisory committee uh two council members are to serve on that budget advisory committee and Pat and Jim have both agreed to serve so we would move they be appointed to serve on the budget advisory oh yeah isn't that a person versus a counselor it's not even on your uh memo even and then there's one other empty vacancy seat and Dan has asked to serve on the budget advisory committee um I'll let you guys to make that as well I would Enlighten them move on that it's almost motion wait a second oh second okay any questions comments oh okay well Pat bye Bob hi bye thank you um I sent you a memo with talking about the draft audit uh there were a couple things in the general ledger that I think may be taken out of the general ledger I think the council Council needs to approve that happening um one of them as I explained is the it is um the unpaid taxes for main energy and that has already been taken off the books the Auditors did it last year but it is still listed as uncollectible taxes that are due and what it does is that it it generates comments questions uh queries every time the audit comes out and people see that and they talk about it and so but the reason why upbringing it up is that um there's absolutely nothing that we can do about that there was an agreement sign in 2020 and approved by the council back then that in in exchange of receiving that property uh we forego any liabilities that were owed to us by Green energy so there you can't collect anything you can't win anything in court we agreed to that after 2020. so that is one thing that I would like to see get off the books the other thing is the um is the this hundred and one thousand dollars has been on there since brand new forever uh on Farm Park now it was listed on the last five the last audit has been lost the festival and every time I saw Cheryl she going in here had a culinary bringing that out thinking that she personally owned this 101 thousand dollars so the purpose of that was and and what we could have done when we did it we could have simply expensed it and just taken it off the books when we built Farm Park but the thought was rather than do that what we can do is as we as the facility gets utilized we can take the rent that we earn we can apply it against that eventually be paid well that became a moot point when we sold it back in 2015 or 2060. so again it's one of the things that just kind of hangs out there and you know the town has been through it tells me through a lot and um and you guys hired me to to solve the problem we've hired Tim to move this to move this community forward what I really do want after seeing spend he has a finite amount of energy he has a finite amount of resources that we just hate the thoughts of being happy to utilize those to try to deal with issues that he can't do anything about and so I think that those they need to come off our general ledger both of those things and I talked to the Auditors they said we can take them off but the council needs to approve it I said take them off ask the council to approve it if they don't we'll have to put it back over but I I think for the the betterment of this community these things need to come on so can we please so what was the initial a hundred and one thousand dollar debt I don't want anybody that is this that happened back in my tenure so I mentioned that was 2006 or 2007 I can't remember it's been a while but I'm thinking 130 000 or so and um and so you know we had you know I had an agreements up and you know it was primarily being used by Bluegrass but you know in you know we were entering into a contract seeing who's making payments so finding applied against the debt um but we did use it for other you know other reviews for other things some people use it for weddings we had a dfest use it a couple of times for their picnics I mean it was a used facility and that used it last Friday uh you know so um anyway that was the intent and and if we still own it we could still continue to be doing that but we don't so if we take a hit where do we take this hit well what it does is that it reduces our it reduces our net worth by a hundred thousand dollars is what it does well but if you add in re-energy and that's already that hit has already been taken there is nothing there is why is it even showing anywhere yeah it was okay 440 000 yeah no I mean I got this straight from the I get this straight from Giselle okay yeah all right that has so there is no additional hit and the information that I provided you in terms of where we are like with our general government fund balance that's taking that into consideration has taken a hundred thousand dollar here okay commute motion so you're asking for uh in your approved asking you to approve taking the two items offered general ledger so moved motion that motion second any questions discussions take all those in favor I think folks I appreciate it so uh Dan's done a lot of figuring as you guys have heard here over the over the course of the last hour and 10 minutes and um with the increase in our overall property valuation we're able to reduce the mill rate this year from 26.5 to 24.25 uh leaves us with the overlay of 7852 dollars so we'd like to move and have you approved setting the mill rate age 24.25 so move second questions comments that hi hi hi thanks guys um dear maybe 11 years old October 23rd wow so we have prepared a confirmation that there's only a few years and then have you folks approve it uh we will sign it and hopefully Tim or someone will be able to present that tour on her birthday on the 23rd their families get together they're going to have a big party for her and um and I listen I would love to do it I'm not going to be here but that's a you know he doesn't love me she's a sweetheart she really is Mrs thank you if I may I'd like to clarify that this is 23.16. oh

both are alternate positions it is the recommendation of the planning board that Chris Campbell filled one of those vacancies I know that we have appointed Christian Bell the planning board second half all those in favor all right um Jim ever um net with the ladies of the library and they looked at that machine that we've got downstairs that has been that is that is the spiritual World War One machine gun that is brand new never been used distilled in the box that's shipped in uh he's been sitting in the library at least 60 years that's when I was playing foreign anyway Jim would like to be able to take that over get it out of the crate take it over to the Block House to be able to display it but the other thing is I think it's a great idea I think so too uh and so I would ask the council for our permission to allow me to do that so move hi thank you I didn't use that for the beaver problems yeah so I have two other things uh one is that we need to appoint Tim as the alternate board member to AWS October 2nd so we might as well get that out of the way uh because I'm the current alternate member Steve is the regular so if the council could approve Tim to be the new alternate ornament AWS uh so moved all those in favor aye aye great in the last thing we do need to introduce one more importance and that is 23 16 and I want you to know that we've been we were working on that this this afternoon probably within two hours of this meeting um Jen and I have been um been talking and working um at putting together an agreement uh with uh Bruce a sergeant for the construction of a native chat processing plant in Fort Fairfield and uh we've been working with Jeff Ashby uh Jeff put together a lease purchase agreement for the land uh off where the energy was I was in contact with Bruce today and he said let's do it fantastic so this is not so please understand that this is not a done deal what this is is the beginning of a very long process right but it's the beginning of a very long process before Fairfield money yeah and so uh it's uh Tim and I will be um working with Bruce and with a lot of other entities as you will note and let me know that I included with that agreement um to help facilitate the process and help facilitate groups to be able to access funds particularly from state and federal sources um and at some point there will be a a more defining agreement that will be between a taste of Maine which is the company that Roost has formed in the town of Fort Fairfield but we're not anywhere near ready for that but this is the beginning right so uh it is I gotta tell you it's it's a it did my art it in my heart more to think that I was going out by being able to present this ordinance tonight um I I just I'm telling you guys I just see nothing but good things ahead from this community this is just the beginning it still may not happen it potentially if there's a potential it could be someplace else but it's right now it's happening so uh I would ask a counselor to introduce this audience I'd like to introduce very ordinance thank you exactly we're good don't need a second we're all set no and so Mr chairman that includes your business Mr chairman I'd like to make a motion for the minutes on August 16th on a regular council meeting motion those minutes of motion second okay all those in favor all right and I would entertain a motion for warrants number four the amount of 531 674.66 and warrant number five for the amount of 405 574 and 79 cents motion second that motion who made it we didn't get emotion yet emotion Mr chairman I'd like to make a motion to accept more number four and number five in the amount stated okay motion second okay all those in favor aye aye then you had something other I do um guys this is it hard to imagine you know it's been a year and I've been thinking about you know this is my this is my last meeting um and I'm thinking about you know what I want to share um uh with the group and so it really has been a really an amazing year for me and one that honestly I'll never forget I mean who on Earth would have thought the highlight of their career would be a 72. certainly not me um is because this has been this has been one for the ages the first thing I'm going to do is I just want to thank Council so Jim and Kevin are the ones that really got me into this and I'm thinking I'm thanking them uh I am I am because um the thing that I appreciate the most is that we sat down as a group and we decided what needed to be done and you were willing to give me the latitude to find my way of doing that and I know that that created some stress uh with counselors and I know experience some stress with other people as well but I can tell you how much I appreciate your faith and trust and my ability to resolve a financial situation and we get it I mean it's so it is um and I think I just want to say that the the what we've been able to do has been directly related to the support that we received from you folks through the process and I know that it always hasn't always been easy and So speaking for the whole Community I just want to thank the council for your leadership through this transition because I I know it hasn't been easy and um and you guys are steadfast and and I thank you for that I would say to the citizens um in our four-year taxpayers I mean you guys took an awful hit and it was an unprecedented situation uh but I can tell you through this whole thing the support and words of encouragement that I received on a fairly consistent basis um really uh made the job that much more easier and really helped with my spirits throwing some of the challenging shines that we had I really felt the community came together around this and um and I would say that the collective Grace and support for me and staff assembly I I just was really it's just this was not easy this was not easy for anyone um I feel that the character the collective character of community is a collective mindset of its citizens and what I've experienced what I've seen what I have felt I just believe that we have an amazing future in front of us because of the community that we have and I just have really been honored to be able to serve in this capacity to be able to do that and the last thing I want to talk to the employees wow guys it's been an interesting year I mean it really has I think yeah it's um you know I mean I I am I'm gonna I'm really gonna miss all you guys you know I think of the friendships that we forged the battles that we fought the successes that we were able to achieve I I take great comfort uh with all of you supporting Tim as our new leader that I just know you guys are going to do do you guys are gonna do really great you really are there are two things that I want you to remember first thing is is that I may have been the Catalyst but I'm telling you I wasn't the guy in the trenches and that this these group of employees in a nine month period say this community a million dollars you guys saved this community a million dollars in nine months now there aren't many people that can say that and you guys are the ones that did it it's um it is it's incredible but you know what really makes me the most proud it's not that you did it and you kept the institution intact the biggest concern that I had is that we can knock the money out of the budget but are we going to have a functional government in the process and you kept this community intact to kept your head down you did the work you provided the services that these citizens deserved and you did it in a positive proactive manner you supported each other in this process you presented yourself to this community as a solid functional Workforce and our town is not only better financially collectively our spirit is better and because of the the presence that you had you created an environment that would cost someone like Tim goth to want to be part of it that's what you guys did and it's just hard to describe this is pretty damn amazing so I just want you to know that that for me for this oral Feller this is an experience that I will carry my heart for the rest of my days and you guys are just amazing group of people thank you well put down it's been an honor Dan as a freshman counselor you could be exposed to Dan Foster it's been it's been fun thank you you're in this as well we're glad that you'll be on the budget advisory committee so you'll still get to hang out with us through the due process yeah a little bit a little less stress for you now maybe that is that is it folks I believe Tony's flagging me down about public hearings no schedule in the hearings well while they're sitting here I wonder what's best for giving them the information they want Oh I thought he talked about it earlier ten minutes and twice in passing yeah go ahead I can just report under uh public comment period ordinances that need hearings I think we can do it with two advertisements and two notices save us some money I would like to do the 3 23 12 23 13 23 16 noon on Wednesday the 11th and then at six o'clock that evening to 23 15 because we want to make sure that we get the best opportunity for people to show up right and make comments if they have them right if we run them all together and we do them all at noon time probably going to miss somebody that really gives a worthwhile comments so my suggestion to Town Council is that you authorize the manager and his staff to schedule and work on public hearing notices and use of the room head that way second I don't think that took three members I knew you could do it so beautiful yeah all well yeah motion seconds all those in favor and the floor is open for public comment period for their final public comment period okay no further Ado I'd accept a motion to adjourn Mr chairman I make a motion that we adjourned all those in favor aye hey man thank you Dan we're going to miss you buddy yeah you haven't left yet oh,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,dCApFmpDU_E,16August23 Regular Town Council Meeting,,62.0,3731.0,2023-08-17T19:12:05Z,none,129,1,0,0,six o'clock uh all counselors are present I'd like to ask how many leaders in prayer we pray for our country at all times that all sins are safe healthy and happy we pray for wisdom for those who guide and govern help this government body in every situation to know and to do the things that are right and just the soundness of judgment in making vital decisions we pray for the peacemakers the Holy life-given Spirit May ever dwell in their hearts and the barriers of fear suspicion and hatred may fall as we pray to the Holy Father amen amen one nation under God an indivisible with liberty and Genesis problem okay I'd like to like to open up the floor for a public comment period three minutes state your name Larry you don't want to talk to me all right all right yeah okay well you better breathe thank you thank you correspondence your reports and your license and permits we do have a catering permit for Northern Union Brewing Company apparently they are taking care of some wedding events coming up on Saturday I do know My Views not a clue but I would strongly encourage the council to uh vote to approve the permit a second uh financial report so you have seen the um the July financials the first month of the year um you know there was nothing really upwind in terms of expenses um there are as you know when you look at the report it what it what it does it gives you a 1 12 of expenses for a year so 3.33 whatever it is uh and in office if you don't spend money that way so it appears that some budgets are over some are under has a lot to do with what's going on in a particular department so we saw that with the um with the rec department which is because the pool is open there's a lot of Staff uh in the summertime a lot of programs going on but it pulls an expensive items so you're gonna that you're going to see that be over and that will all level off as you go through the gear same thing with the police because of the festival a lot of overtime or a lot of parts to other people but again that is built into the budget so in any event nothing really stuck out for me uh on the expenses we all look fine uh on the revenue side we have an incredible method excellence trailers so that was one of the reasons why but still that was quite a bit higher than last year uh Engineers I don't know why but thank you citizens for Fairfield has been keeping the ship afloat um the uh the cash flow is uh we're in really really great shape and cash flow part of the reason is that we did receive harder homestead exemption in July which I wasn't anticipating until August I honestly thought that we would be borrowing I guess I would credit some of the reasons why I was after guitar getting here on July 5th and get the agreement side so that if we needed the money and as it turns out we did not I I anticipated going into August that we would have borrowed 150 000 on our loan and we'd have about thirty thousand dollars in cash going into the and going into August in reality we did know tomorrow on our line and we had 451 thousand uh in cash so that is uh expenses being in line uh income being ahead with Revenue sharing and with XI Stacks but also uh the getting that chunk of money 200 000 on the homestead so as far as August is concerned again we were borrowing money in August and appears that we're not going to have to right now we've got almost six hundred thousand dollars uh in the bank we've had our largest uh our largest North which was 59 000 uh first order of the month the next one is going to be less uh we still have Revenue sharing coming in we still have miscellaneous income so I'm anticipating coming into this month we will still want to have borrowed any money you know that probably close to 500 000 in the bank so all in all I mean financially you know things have really really settled down I I on the council I estimated that we would be borrowing over a seven month period about 950 000 and right now it looks like it's going to be a three month maybe four month period we're gonna borrow maybe 500 550 000. so it's going to be a lot less it's going to save us a lot of money in interest so anyway financially guys are doing well uh I don't really see anything out there on the horizon that's going to change that as you know things do come up but um all in all we're looking pretty good anybody have any questions any of this okay thanks guys uh and I did get that out to the I think you saw the budget advisory committee uh when I said Geo I was in Florida and I didn't have their email addresses but I did get a job so that so they have it um I just want to note that this is the second month in a row that I'm doing aristically Solutions because our fellow wasn't there I could do it for you though today is I hear you this is very unusual it is very very unusual that's the reason why I had to mention it um so you know things are going really well out there they they're too what I would consider pretty major things that are going on Steve when when did when did try Community become AWS how long ago was that so part of that transition you know incorporating Presque Isle into um into the uh handling our waste stream up here in Houston County uh was that we were going to do reviews we're going to use one site at a time so the agreement was is that they would temporarily close Prescott and they would use strike Community when info well that just happened uh they just finally closed uh Presque Isle but they've done for residential residents who want to bring their their waste they have a transfer station uh it's basically a roll-off and they just got a brand new compactor for it uh it just got installed but all commercial waste now is coming directly to product community so that has been that has been in the works for a while um and the transition has finally been made in front of listening to Mark it's been a fairly smooth transition everybody knows what they're doing and and uh and and it's actually happened um the other thing that's going on is uh they're building two new cells five and six uh the right now they're about 30 or at the time of the meeting they were about 30 complete they're dealing with rain issues like anybody else is trying to get something down outside um but uh they feel like they're going to be able to complete this the September season that's correct September that they should be done and they'll be utilizing uh the utilizing the new cells and so they you know they want to take it's a combination of getting it built start using it but also getting the resources in terms of what you charge to uh incorporate the cost of the cells uh so you know that is that's kind of like a work in progress so you need to tie those two things together get it done and and make sure that what you're charging will cover the um the carrying costs of building those a lot of money um so that really is is there anything there Steve that I should have talked about but didn't uh the only things that last month Kevin asked a question about how we we may see an increased traffic flow from those trucks increased traffic flow through Puerto Rico with the trucks coming from Presque Isle right and I talked to Mike about that and he did an analysis that he said but it's going to be about a 12 increase is what it is 12 yeah that's the only other thing anybody have any questions what's the uh what's the life expectancy like on one of those said cells or is there any like projections on how long it takes to all right but is there any herself for those two cells for that project that we're working on now yeah wow I remember the thing the key reason we were looking to do is the merger was Prescott we have 200 licensable agents out there in Fort Fairfield they have 600 licensable acres and they've only used about 80 anymore we're well into what they're bringing over still 26 years yeah because that's that's a flow coming in so right now I'll close around 30 000 yards a year so yeah it's been um you know it's it's a it's a Troublesome issue you know trying to how you handle waste and it's not inexpensive um so uh it's it's you know this this Tri-County landfill and our recently Solutions has been a very good deal you know you know we've received we've received um Equity payments from it we we have as an owner we have a reduced cost per ton for for our own ways our own Community waste so you know it's been and we've got a very good record too much done for a job and you can instantly did a great job for him yeah okay listen get the gives me absolute great pleasure to ask Miss Barbara I said here she is here I'm here um they talked about all the great things that Roman wanted to watch thank you Barbara please thank you for having me um and I want to apologize for not being here last month um on the wrong date but um and thank you Dan for potioning for us and saying such nice things so um then couldn't be here tonight so these are coming from her notes and some of it will be a little redundant and I'll try to get through it quickly for you so um just wanted to talk about the patrons in the operation and what we did was we wanted to give you guys some kind of a perspective as numbers like you were saying doesn't matter unless you have the perspective so um the library is always working on increasing your patronage and uh in show live we had 493 people come through the library as opposed to 240 last July and that has to do with of course the best schools going on but we also have a lot of activities that are going on we're having the artist shows we're doing the awful Fest we just have a lot of good stuff that was going on so we decided for the best the best month that we've ever had um we had 14 new patrons come in including some that had come back from being away for many many years from getting back into the area as opposed to eight last year we had eight groups that are using the community room on a regular basis that's compared to two last year um we're buying eBooks on a monthly basis and we're staying with a hard budget and that has been one of the biggest complaints of that we just weren't getting new books in so we're getting a lot of good buy-in with that um then has done an amazing job on her Facebook presence and we currently have them up by Taylor Swift or anything but we have 550 friends and we're doing about 1100 hits per cycle that's pretty good for a community this size um and we're also doing Facebook websites Flyers trying to keep the people in a publicly knowing what's going on in the library and we've gotten really good attendance with that and she's doing the bi-weekly newspaper article in getting a lot of good feedback on that um in terms of the shaw family room that the community room downstairs um we were really very very proud of what we were able to do down there and so I took delivery I just did two people I think we're on a budget so um well sold yes he doesn't have to share so this is kind of the Long View of the room and what we have done with the staff and volunteers put up picture rails we have rails there we're having um a heat pump put in Steve did all of our lighting which is absolutely beautiful um it's just really becoming long a very very beautifully Mr Cormier is working on our signs which has been this is his kind of hobby so it's taking a little while to get there but those are going to be coming and we're waiting for them to come in and so we're hoping that with the lighting and with the heat pump we're going to be able to save electricity and Fuel and just make a very very comfortable area um so we secured out of the four grants that we applied for we secured three of them um and one of them is the American Library Association branded at ten thousand dollars and that Grant was it's a targeted area and when I decided to Target was our 65 and older because that's a huge part of the population here and what we did with that is we offered or we our rent was written as doing a Cozy Corner and we only have two of these because budget so this is what we've done so far and this is going to be available for anybody but our Target Advance we had to go and kind of specify a group and so we went and we met with them is eligible to use it but what we're going to be doing is we met with this group and they told us what they want to see there and they've asked for doing knitting crafts technology help having the speakers come in but we also have a coffee bar here so anytime that we're open they can come in and make it into a social area the nice coffee shop in town that's usually accessible so it'll be there for coffee tea we're going to have um newspapers down there coffee coffee table books things like that and also part of this grant was we just had the new 88 door which was failing so it was going to be very easy access and we're going to have stanchions put it outside when we're having activities so that that side parking lot people can park there there will be in any kind of parking part of that branch is also that if anybody has a barrier getting there like transportation we have money in that um um the second Grant was the Stephen and Tabitha King brand that was twenty thousand dollars to get our roof fixed and Mr Campbell's schedule will be coming this month and then the last was a four thousand dollar grant for the Mraz family Grant and what we did was we had a lovely young lady who came and did her community hours at my library and um she's just a really neat young lady who probably needs some really good confidence and so she's going to come in and we're going to train her to do the archive work um it's kind of Taken we're independent but it's the terrific skill building kind of thing for her she doesn't have to have a lot of social interaction so we're hoping that that's going to be a really good fit for a while um in terms of programs and events they're being really well attended story time is back without any kids craft afternoon we've done things like flower arrangement with Pat which is was a huge hit um this is the first year that the library participated with the David Watson Festival um we were part of the city blind yard sale where we had our book sale not that period of time they're having the artist of the month was there a Philomena Irving which is amazing and we had our first bubble dress which was tons of fun we just had a spring exhibition and um we adjusted our work schedule so we hired down here behind the pillar this is Robin gagne so what Lynn and I did was we divided up our hours by three and that gives us better coverage for the library so if somebody is sick if somebody's on vacation we always have two people at the at the library at all time um we had an incredible opportunity to have Dr Anastasia Regal come into the library a couple of weeks ago she's a professor at Humane and her specialty is archival and special collections um and she charges thousands of dollars to do these sorts of Assessments of reflection and she offered two days for free and came in and worked with Lynn Cody and Annette Thompson and she did an amazing report I did one it's 30 pages front and back I didn't think that you probably didn't get a game so um so what I'm going to do is I'm going to submit it to you guys if anybody wants to look over it but probably page 12 is the most and she goes through like for all her recommendations for assessment and recommendations so if anybody would like to read that that's available to you then um okay almost done um so in terms of uh like a medium term goal um I'd like to talk with the council a little bit about updating our adult and juvenile nonfiction section so we have some money in our gullible travel at Dollar travel throughout we got I just was watching this with my kids today got over trust account um the non-fiction has not been updated we did and updated for about 40 years so it's very very Antiquated so we were thinking between five and six thousand dollars over the next 10 months it's going to take a lot of time to get those weeded and bought and cataloged and put back in so um wanted to put excuse me put that out I'm talking about money so I'm getting pasty so so I just wanted to put that up to you guys to think about it and this doesn't happen with my husband so and then in terms of a long-term goal I would want to continue to work closely with our town manager and our um Town manager about the possibility of opening the library at more hours extended services and just being able to continue to have the library be the Hub that we think that it can be for this community so that's kind of a hole so I just want to say that all of this issues talked about a few days a week they had a budget that went from 138 000 to 58. how'd that happen means yes you know I just looked at it you'd like to move the program oh okay anyway my point is it has just been for me just utterly amazing to watch what these two ladies have done it really really is it it's uh Way Beyond anything that I would have ever thought of or respected they just um I know that I briefly talked about some of the stuff but I just wanted you to hear it from them um it just it is always Intrigue when I go in there and I can tell you they do not hold back when the film manager shows up because they're on a mission and uh and I have nothing but respect for the work that they do the drive that they have the initiative uh and the imagination um and now we have a gun machine gun the weather doesn't work always at work 60 years ago or it is in my mind downstairs all right thank you thank you thank you yeah thanks so much [Applause] all right Main Street revitalization report that's me yes it is so we had difficulties with the weather as everybody else has we had planned to have this event last Friday and because of the weather forecast we had to change it to Saturday we weren't sure just exactly what was going to happen and unfortunately we lost some vendors because they had other commitments and so we didn't have the food trucks and stuff that we wanted to have there but we had a fantastic turnout I want to thank um Darren and his Department because I last minute Thursday called and requested to borrow some trash cans and some traffic cones and stuff and he had them there they were ready and we were all set with that same thing with Doug I called Doug and said can you get me some tables and chairs because I don't know what we're gonna have and he brought them down Saturday morning and dropped them off and it was just it was so wonderful to have that support and to have that um had offers from town counselors to come in and help and do whatever we needed Dan showed up and he was present and went around and talked to all the vendors so that was it was nice to see that turnout and support we had food vendors we had crafters and we had a cornhole tournament and it was a success it went it was supposed to go from 11 to 2 it was busy right up until the cornhole tournament ended around 3 30. um good good turnout good event happy gonna have another one in September and it's going to be us it's going to be a harvest hoe down before Harvest gets into full swing hopefully and uh what one more day it's gonna be I think it's gonna be September 8th it's going to be on Friday because September 9th blackstone's new craft fair yep so we'd be competing there we don't want to do that so there's also an ATV ride in honor of Ken Stratton that's going to be held on the ninth as well so we'll try to segue into that somehow and support that event too but we're going to have a harvest hoe down as far as I know we've got is it I think it's Star City Syndicate some of the members in that band are going to be playing for us that night we've got them coming and I'm not sure we've got a bunch of other things planned so it looks to be interesting so that was really nice it really was that I mean just a small group but you guys did a great job it's the busiest I've seen Main Street outside of the Harvest um I don't know what it was like I'm sure it was even busier at the light parade but besides that just on a weekend in Fort Fairfield in the summer it's the busiest I've seen Main Street in a long time it was cool it was it was nice yeah we have lots of ideas you know now that is a that is a good thing to see happening I can tell you um I just wanted to talk just briefly about the child manager transition so as you know Tim will be starting October 2nd uh I will be here until then uh between now and then Tim and I have already met yeah we're going to be meeting on a regular basis between now in October uh he and I uh have scheduled a meeting with the budget advisory committee on August 30th Tim's will be meeting with the department heads on September 5th uh and we're going to be talking about the transition uh with them as well I will be available on an as needed basis if Ken needs me to come in I'm going to be here till the 19th and I'm more than happy to do that's not a problem um there really is um you know I'm sure Tim and I will be talking I'm sure there'll be things that will slip through the cracks but there really probably isn't anything that I'm doing that isn't there that somebody in the account is uh and one of the things that we are really fortunate is that we really do have great managers and employees people know their jobs they do them they do them well they're very accountable nobody needs to be micromanaged uh and they were a huge help to me and the year that I've been here and trying to do the things that I felt needed to be done and I know that they're going to be uh doing the very same thing for Tim so that's going to be a huge support for him uh through the um through the through the staff here in in the managers and the other thing too is that you know Tim Tim worked here for two and a half years and and so he has a feel for the sister Tim was involved in economic Community Development which as far as I'm concerned is 80 of the job that town manager has to do we need to be involved in the economic community and development and we're going to talk about that a little bit later as well so Tim is already on top of that and understands it Tim obviously understands the financial side he spent the last four or five years in banking and he and I uh if he has any questions or Trio or the budget I mean I'm always there I mean all the department of heads everybody understands their budgets and and what they need to do so I I feel really confident that Tim is going to hit the ground money I think something's been great he's got some great ideas he's got some things he's working on right now even though he's trying to finish up his house he's still working full-time at the bank in fact we just had to put something on the agenda because we need to have homes on it tonight uh something that Tim is working on um so um I guess I just wanted to share that with you guys this is kind of where we're going I'm certainly comfortable with it uh Tim is definitely comfortable with it and you know two things it's a good leader so I mean I think we're going to be in great shape any concerns no we're all week thanks guys um the only other thing I uh yeah I don't want to take all the credit but here um yeah I have no idea I didn't see that today um I did I just wanted to put this on on the under reports uh you know the we don't have anybody in the wings a great room to start or retail business for a premier order um you know I I think it's something to me it's not a question whether we do it or not it's a question of how we do it I think we want to be organized it's not simplistic Jolene has got some information from Prescott has been extremely helpful but you know we totally put together an application form that people are going to have to fill out standards that are going to have to do that uh so it's not just um it's it's not just opening up a store it's a little bit more complicated than that and I I really do not want to have us do this and not be ready to do it and do it in a professional appropriate way so anyway the bottom line is is that I'm just not comfortable in doing that right now um and Tim and I really haven't spent much time talking about this but he certainly need to be brought up to speed I need to hear his thoughts about this as well um so I don't see that there's any really good hurry uh but um can I update can I give you a brief update because I did have a citizen come to me and talk to me about that I think there there's some plans to open a store but there's also some concerns about what the regulations are going to be and the requirements um and there's a lot of good there's they ask some really really good questions um you know as far as location and distances and right where and signage I mean we haven't it hasn't been introduced yet we haven't asked the community issues um and we haven't finalized it yet Joanie's gone through it Matt's gone through it and Mike has seen it um and we as a group of men get together and I just think there's some interest in it that is kind of just starting to buzz around out there so yeah and just to be aware that people are thinking about it and so what we we just want to make sure that when we do get an interview is it should be a public hearing that should be attended well attended people should be bringing those questions and also please encourage them if they have some concerns or they have some questions that you know contact me and contact Toby you know that's it yeah that's really moving should be correct absolutely and we did that with um repealed marijuana ordinance if we did that six o'clock we did that was what we did since yeah so anyway so that's is there any questions about that so if you hear any workouts please let me know I certainly don't okay thank you uh the only other thing that I want to mention under reports is um the uh there and Jesse put in an application uh for these uh pretty intense size or MDOT for schools and uh do you folks that approved us putting it aside on President and what we had decided was that we were going to wait to see if we could get these signs from interviewing if we didn't then we would get the sign and Matt was talking about and so we'll at least have one at the entrance of thank you thank you Larry so anyway I I've interrupted I haven't talked a man about this all of a sudden the real life yeah so if we have it if he hasn't ordered it you'll get it orders so I just want to let you know that we haven't forget that and that is all I have under uh foreign thank you Dan yes sir whole business Community environment project recommendations what do you think guys are you looking for a table okay let's uh yeah what's everybody's thoughts here with the uh the empowerment project recommendations is there any is there any numbers here that stand out wow I just got my package because I was not here so I see a few things I'd like to say are you serious no we just did that last moment okay we spent a lot of time discussing them I had a lot of meetings discussing it coming up at this recommend Ed yeah that was that was all that was all yeah last month meeting you know this is your this is yours this is your second Memo from DNA it was very well written this last one yeah still a lot of work which involved you folks all department heads yeah um in Catherine facilitated it I thought she did a great job and in in um bringing down all the concerns and promise that people had to these seven points um and you know it doesn't mean that we can't be doing things Beyond us but this is this was the basic recommendations of the group that meant for almost three months yes we don't I mean we can we can develop some of these recommendations they'll necessarily have to take all the different places do we you could you can uh you can you can improve any one one to seven um you can if there are some that you want to think about table or up north I don't I don't think we need to um I mean if we're gonna we're gonna look at one through seven or one through five or one I I would like to move that we take the recommendations and have them reviewed by uh MMA or our attorney just to verify that we're not opening up or closing anything that could lead us into issues I I don't think we need to table it but I'd like to see anything from here go to our town attorney or nma for review I know but if you look at foreign and I had the conversation and I haven't give it up yet but yes if I think the confusement is is where we're at with this I but I'll just I'd like to add they're they're pretty straightforward here I mean this is this is our town this is our town with a good group of people and business owners and citizens and amongst us counselors also and uh I think it's all pretty straightforward you know I don't think it'd be much to adopt these moving forward good recommendations yeah really the question is is that is there a specific recommendation that you're not comfortable with I'd have one okay which is the amended language to include with the annual Town budget part over 250 000 manager Etc right for accomplish is required for items to pass okay and in my short tenure I've known that at one time the budget would not have passed so you understand what happens when the budget doesn't pass yes okay so I mean it's we're not talking into the world here no no right so so do you would you rather have it leave it the way it is or would you rather be unanimous I mean you don't want the four so that means you want to leave it at three I think you're going to open a can of worms as you go forward really do you have any of the budgets that I passed in 15 years I know you passed them all but but if you don't understand the most we had them and you know the reason why we go ahead and put manager well obviously no no that's not the reason why oh I appreciate the comments things like this things like this and this is important for the town they seem to be done by consensus because the way this is It's a way these sorts of things so if there's never going to be a budget that everybody's 100 happy with whether you're an apartment or a counselor or a citizen but the point is is that you got to try to figure out how you get to the best place that you possibly can try to keep everybody reasonably happy and run the town okay and and so it's it's a process that needs to be managed not just by the department not just by the town manager but by the council and so you constantly work to to bring everybody to the same place I don't I don't really have any overwhelming problems with that because it was always a five-hole vote that's all I ever knew and if it's a 3-2 vote there's a problem they're seriously a problem and as obviously we all well know there was a problem and um so I I I know that it's different and I can assure you that the language is fine uh but we that would be if we were gonna have anything to be reviewed it would be the amended language and if you guys approve this what would happen is is that we'd have to put together an ordinance to to do this which would require public hearing does the system have a right to talk about and counselors I write to talk about the change and then it would be voted on uh whether we approved or not so if you if you approve all of these what you've approved on number six is for an ordinance to be introduced to make this change it doesn't mean that it's going to automatically happen what you're authorizing what you're approving is to have an ordinance no the only ordinance that the only one who needs an ordinance is number six because it amends the title chart that's my right phone thank you [Music] [Laughter] you're killing me okay okay so yeah so we get we get a motion to uh that you're that that motion was for number six correct all for all seven okay okay emotion to uh to approve all seven okay motion second any questions discussions okay go to vote Kevin bye hi Jim hi Bob hi nice [Laughter] hear that okay Darren you're up Aaron wants a plow track I don't know it sounds like a lot of money to me so you guys can decide what you think [Music] Darren doesn't want a plow drop Darren needs a plow truck down uh February of last this year we bought our first F550 worked out really well better than I expected the truck will do a lot again we can put under CDL drivers in some real Class C license we've been able to hire some part-timers talk to the gentleman this morning um I think he's open to anything um so our plan was to to buy three of these trucks we bought one again we tried it worked really well um we decided to save some money to to put some more into Paving which we'll talk about later uh we we upfitted an F450 that was underutilized um that truck is probably about halfway through the process of turning into a plow truck with a sander plow Wing everything everything's going pretty well and now we need the the third um again I think these will take a pressure off our wheelers they certainly will not replace our wheelers in a certain storm uh I had one of the counselors behind me on the Center Road and I was actually cleaning the road up so that you get home with this truck so one of you have seen it in action during that absolutely absolutely uh but anyway they won't replace a Wheeler They will take the pressure off they will uh they're much lighter they're much cheaper to run they help out a lot early spring uh you know late fall all of those things before freeze up just just really impressive what they'll do and what they can do for us also with the part-timers you know it's just a lot cheaper to have part-timers and keep more of those going uh with these trucks we can increase the level of surface you know on a smaller snow storm we may have these on a run that doesn't have wind or anything so that the wheelers can focus on the you know the major north south Brothers where the heavy winds occurs oh yeah it's a win-win on both situations and it keeps the wheeler from traveling back and forth so it really is a point situation it's working this this hasn't just been since February that we started this process with one times we're just trying it out to see how it worked and those work well these work much oh yeah they're awesome so just so you know that this money has been allocated for this year that requires a budget that you guys approved so this is going to be money but it's just you're just approving this specific purchase of this vehicle uh that one that you're looking at helped us uh was one last thought because we're almost at the 2015 yes it's three years newer than the one that we bought previous but it does share the same Driveline so we can put some parts on the shelf and have a few things that's one thing I thought would be important um this truck is at a dealer in Vermont so although it will not come with a warranty we agreed on them doing a DOT inspection and then going through the truck whatever they found they found this price is with all its included brakes um universal joints in the Driveline pretty much anything and also uh paint touch-up well guys has it been a plow truck very long yes the only difference is it has a uh it doesn't have a hopper sander on it it has the sander built into the dumped Karen how many miles this one has less miles than the one we bought I think it was 50 yeah 57 305 miles that's not bad enough no yeah uh we had emotions this one does not this one is stock any further discussion no go go ahead go ahead yeah okay all those in favor you're here um so there's been there has been some concern as you are aware of the second third Main Street um and so we interview some coordinates last week that basically included in uh commercial structure on Main Street to have a Apartments put in on the ground floor uh facing the street and we had um Tony fell a public hearing uh I know Pat was here and I think Charlie's here was here as well there's just some real concerns that uh you know our nation's going to turn into a method of hardness anyway so the uh to my knowledge have you received anything at all uh uh that speaks against us today okay I know I haven't received anything so the manager's recommendation is that we approve the audience so we uh you know I'll move that recommendation oh second any questions discussions okay all those in favor aye aye thank you very much well um that's entire main streets one into the other right yeah all the commercials and that's all I have other old business and your new business uh Karen wants to spend some more money for thank you again I would just preface that the money that he was to spend with the

oh oh okay real good good so obviously the worst section yeah the rest is statement when you're anticipated doing this in September yes mid-seven um I would be glad to do the any road that you want to do you lift it you come up with the cons and I'll have it there you go yeah we can vote on it tonight so we gotta we gotta Motion in a second any any further discussion today like I said I that's just too bad it's on the force half for the better of our community you got loved ones okay all those in favor yes 2015 really and it wasn't a continuous model s that's pretty that's just pretty amazing really uh so thank you Jared for hanging in here you're doing a great job uh the uh the next thing in business is the Genesis trip who has a vacancy one of the marijuana trustees and they have sent a request that the Town Council approvement are just to build that vacancy I think it's a great choice hi very good and we do have one other thing I do in business that was brought up tonight by um our our next film manager he had some issue around a solar project uh tickets so what was yours sir excellent sorry to come in hot and heavy with this um but some discussions I've been having with some folks in the last few days just kind of brought this uh to my attention that um the last couple years the school had looked at a solar project in behind the softball field um kind of adjacent to the elementary school on a parcel of land that they have there projected savings they went through the process of looking at this and had secured the transmission rights for that project ultimately the school board chose not to move forward with this project at the time but that application and the agreement is still in place with the power company the utility that expires relatively soon um substantial cost savings could be realized by the town or the school or both of us or potentially even selling the rights to this transmission line because they're just not making a lot of it um my recommendation or My Hope Is that we can extend this agreement and then buy ourselves basically another two years to explore this opportunity the potential Savings of this I mean I've got some numbers uh over 25 years that could save the town 1.5 million dollars you could look at an annual Savings of about 67 000 a year on a power bill we're looking at it the good news is it doesn't have to technically be cited anywhere right now the proposal that was put forth and explored by the school is in behind the softball field and then adjacent to where the kayaks have been stored at the element it was a managers of the one that's going into the industrial park I talked to him at length one day yeah and he said what's left over on that Industrial Park should be a town hall solar farm for our own energy because all the infrastructure is there to tie in yes yeah well and we have the ability to tie in this project right at the softball field um but again even if we don't choose to move forward with it now and I did uh I did I've cut Dan in the loop with this process and I also want to let you know that I reached out to the superintendent schools Tanya Staples today because it's on school property this was a school project and ultimately I don't want to usurp anybody's power I don't want to take any thunder away from anybody I just don't want to see this project die all right before we have the opportunity to really explore this opportunity right and there's obviously value to this proposal even if we don't build it and somebody else does somebody could build it we could lease it there's a lot of options I just don't want to see us in a month not have this opportunity anymore and someone else comes in and snaps up that capacity on the transmission line and then ultimately the town of Ford Fairfield is Left Right searching for another project which maybe they're better viable options I I don't know what the answer is um and I think that's really what I wanted to I don't have the answers all I know is we didn't build the system for whatever reason and our our ability to get into this will expire if we don't agree to extend this application or this agreement I think it's a small place to pay oh absolutely there's potentially a cost of like a 500 application fee and again it's the schools or is it the towns those I think those are the things that we have to explore as we look into this uh you know superintendent Staples is just starting the job and the school year I called her out the blue today and just said I don't want you to hear about this in the paper or see me standing up here talking about something that's in your backyard and she fully supports um me bringing this for today uh just to help buy us the time to look into this a little bit better yeah um happy to answer questions I mean clearly I've drank the Kool-Aid on solar I have it on my garage it was supposed to pay me back in seven years to pay me back and forth well I love my 6.83 Amira or their song bill I love it until February when I have to pay the regular one that's 200 bucks right yeah um so my my request would be that we uh the council approves us to continue to extend this agreement potentially pay a small application fee to at least have this opportunity and then explore it and then bring it back to you all right thank you further discussion yes I've been working closely with Todd Maynard who had initially proposed this with the school and so Todd has graciously agreed to just help us with that piece of the puzzle and then um you know actually the numbers have to be reworked anyway the potential costs of the project may have gone down 130 000 as well so Dan just to give you a piece of Mind as to where the 500 is going to come out of how you offer the CED travel account 500 out of downtown if we can save the town 1.5 million dollars out of my own pocket just if you guys approving what I was saying I had a feeling but I mean yeah you breathe out online even at it after it's gross right um yeah I have a question I think I may or may not know the answer to it but so tying in because of something that Jim said you know transmission lines talking into transmission lines that's that's a big planet and I don't know if where we've got big power coming in if you can tie into something like that a smaller solar farm or not but maybe maybe Steve's electricity might know people be able to answer that question everybody you need a place they've already got them you know all the work is done the infrastructure is already up there so yeah okay Italian question on it that's already figured into the project so yeah okay good okay yeah no it's it's a it's a whole package we just gotta we we need to buy some time to explore it a little cheaper yeah you know I hate to come in here with an incomplete proposal but I don't know a window that is closing why not kick that that's right two years and it ends at the end of year 24. well yes and well not only are there federal funds for the potential grants that we could pursue to construct this they're also grants available to teach people how to install assault install solar and reduce your labor costs as well so there's a lot of other benefits to this that we could be looking at and I know that this proposal that was brought to the school at one point in time was looking at educational opportunities as well so a lot more to come but just really at this point I just didn't want to see this die uh without us having an opportunity to take a look at it again okay yeah so motion second questions yeah so my train of thought left the station I'm sorry uh sorry about that oh that's all right um yeah well I was just going to say that you know the place of energy costs are going up all the time anything we can do to put ourselves in a better position to help our community with our electrical power yeah anytime is going to be a good thing yeah so that's all that's supposed to say no I agree fully yeah so Motion in a second yep okay hi Kevin Pat hi Jim hey Bob hi how about that thank you thank you thanks Tim for hitting the ground running yeah no problem thanks

o'clock uh all counselors are present I'd like to ask Mr Levesque to lead us in prayer we pray for our country at all times where all citizens are safe healthy and happy we pray for wisdom for all those who guide and govern help this government in every situation to know and to do the things that are right and just the Silence of judgment making vital decisions we pray for the peacemakers but the holy life given Spirit May ever dwell in their hearts and the barriers of fear suspicion and hatred may fall this we pray to the Holy Father amen amen to the flag of the United States of America for which stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all ah okay uh public comment period anybody wants to address the council step to the podium and state your name okay license okay so I like if someone makes a motion to gratify Alliance public yeah all those in favor thank you very much financial report you received uh June's uh financial statement which is the last one for that fiscal year and you know as I stated at the end of the last paragraph you know if I could have only a dream that we would have done as well as we had it would have made the last name list of much smoother now um you know we really you know that the everybody really stepped up you know the employees stepped up Council stepped up the community was very very gracious uh in dealing with what what we've just had what we've just gone through the last year so you know my goal was to hopefully reduce total expenses by 400 000 we actually reduce them by 965 000 uh which is um amazing and everybody's shared in that um uh the uh all the department heads um at least the ones that are here uh you know really really worked hard at making that happen and you know and I I just have to give a nod to Mike because clearly that was the ultimate of the room that's where the biggest issues existed in and it wasn't just the fact that the budget was so uh out of proportion to what the service that was being provided it wasn't just that it was the fact that we had a very dysfunctional department and uh and Mike has just turned that all around in the nine months that he's been here so he's you know he reduced cost by over 500 000 he eliminated sold off excess equipment and eliminate six hundred thousand dollars in debt uh he's maintained his full staff while we're making those reduction again overall expenses he's increases part-time staff he's increases volunteer from two to over 20. uh he's got his own basic EMS license so now that he's actually I think needs somebody on the rig he's going and doing that because he just he has done a lot and his leadership has been exemplary in terms of bringing the employees together as a cohesive working group so I just think that you know that was that was a huge red flag when I started back in September and it just he just really stepped up and so I say Provence to him kudos to all the department heads who have done this great work so consequently we had a small Savings in income uh and we'll see what this how this all ends up because every time we have we're having the Audits and be done here next month and when that happens there's always some adjustments but overall we're looking at over a million dollars being saved uh in this year and so that allows us to get this like credit paid off early and allows us reduce the mill rate this year which I wasn't sure that we'd be able to do it we'll be able to reduce It Again by equally as much next year in conjunction with that we've got to let credit back with the tank we've got a cash flow we actually got money in the bank which is a wonderful thing our bills are paid and so just all in all I can tell you I'm just very very grateful and thankful for everything that this community together has done to make uh this past fiscal year something that is hard for me to imagine picking up so it's just it's just a great finish to uh physical fitness plan last year any comments about any of this just I think it's all making us all feel pretty good right now Milestone big milestone excellent job it's been done well and I think one of the ancillary benefits of this is everybody's just feeling better I mean everybody just feels better you know her feeling more optimistic than other community I mean man that is a different way it really really is and after tonight we're going to be sharing this folder into very good hands and I can't tell you how good that means thanks to YouTube thank you thanks to you too I mean yeah is that what you said you were going to do yeah appreciate it John appreciates it appreciate it hahaha I have a lot of help but I appreciate it great financial report that's a big check mark right there um we are uh the uh the organization through well financially uh they have right now the big thing for them is they're in the middle of a contract uh to build a unequal fluid cells and so Mark is working on the is that the temporary financing work uh and now he's working on the permanent financing which will be through the name Bond Bank at a tax accept rate uh so he's he's getting the finalize touches on that in conjunction with that they are finally closing the Prescott landfill uh so they will be what they're going to end up doing is all commercial haulers will not be there directly to try communities they will have a uh a roll-off they created a transfer station for residential we want to continue to come and they have a permit that they buy it's a little bit will bring their residential garbage there they want to come over and prepare for them so uh all in all Mark's doing a great job and um it was in pretty good shape I'm looking for librarians I am so disappointed you should have not prepared it I should whoever is still standing and I should have reminded them today um but what I would say about the library is that as you know we kind of had a rocky start with when I came here and we had quote two part-time Librarians take over the library uh and and I just can say that they have honestly they've done an exemplary job they really have they're only open three days a week but they have brought back uh volunteers uh I shouldn't have to do this right there but uh and she certainly could attest to this I mean the library is in great shape but what did they've done down in the community center uh the grades that they have applied for they've gotten three grants that I'm aware of they got a grant from Stephen King for twenty thousand dollars to fix them up which is really a great that's been approved they got a grant for ten thousand dollars to create space uh down in the community room that's going to be kind of like a coffee bar um set up for senior citizens and there are working this is in conjunction with the Housing Authority so they're going to get senior citizens to get together they're going to have crafts down there for things for them to do they're going to have like I said they're going to have like a coffee bar set up and it'll be a place for seniors to be able to conjugate and get together so they're doing that they just got a grant who um the moresis and they're hiring they're using that Grant to hire another person to help with digital digitalizing uh the Drew room which is something that they have been doing and so this would just allow them to further do that so you can go online and you can pull up you know the 1860 version of the fort pierrefield review and so they're doing more and more of that um they have they're administering the um it wasn't a grant but it was a gift from the shaw family um and they've they put it they put in new lighting down in the community center room they hung a a rail that goes around about two-thirds of the way up the wall it looks really nice uh Pixlr Rob did that they've had three art shows down there uh Renee uh from panda bear Royale did our show it had a great showing sold a lot of stuff so they've got another one going on and the part of the work that the group that Catherine uh facilitated that was one of the things to have an apartment has different departments come up and talk to the council that's what I would have liked to have heard from Lynn and from Barbara and even though I am driving to London Ontario tomorrow how are you good how are you doing good you getting all this yep okay great thank you um so anyway you know for for uh what um for the restrictions that were put on the library from West Church standpoint they've been amazing their attitude is great their politics are huffy and they're just in there but I just we just couldn't ask for it okay Library report um Patricia Main Street revitalization report yeah Charles is here he is you guys had a busy Friday we did we were like a lot of the potato Blossom Festival we got some rain we started out really great guns we were selling lots of Strawberry Shortcakes and there was a good crowd and a good turnout and then we got this huge downpour and it kind of put everything off for a while and then it stopped raining and we stayed everybody else a few vendors left but most stayed and people came back and we continued it was a it was a pretty good turnout I was impressed I was I was glad to see everybody that showed up and I I think it was a good start we meet tomorrow night we've got vendors excited the vendors showed up we've had a lot of small business vendors talk about being willing to be involved in a small business in Fort Fairfield hopefully we can plant some seeds to get some business growth um we meet tomorrow night to go over our our earnings from the Strawberry Shortcake sale um see where we found where we ended up there we had some stuff left over for sure um and make plans for the next Friday and fort in August so we're gonna have something every month I'm not exactly sure what it's all going to look like or how it's all going to turn out but it's going to be it's going to be something active and we're going to become you know people are going to get used to us I think yeah thank you you're welcome today [Music] for the record Trail steer 3 Hamilton Avenue Pat hit on just about everything what I wanted to add is the fact that we had the initially going in we had about 12 vendors some of those included food trucks but of the dozen or so that actually showed up we have interest in about three of them potentially opening up business or an interest perhaps not on their own going in with someone on a possible Co-op situation so 3 out of 12 is not bad so we'll be talking with those vendors tomorrow night and so hopefully some other potential vendors down the road so and we've talked to a property owner about using a property downtown for a potential Co-op situation and a place where we could move indoors for the first few months of the colder season thank you thank you thanks but I just want to let you folks know that um we are after about 20 years we are going to be operating our Trio to a web-based program there is an additional cost um document additional costs cost of the subscription is the additional cost or just doing an upgrade building about four thousand dollars we do have it in our budget to pay for that it is going to um I know staff is really excited it's going to make their job a lot easier plus it's going to create opportunities for citizens to be able to access more stuff it's something that we just need to be doing more on as we go down and run so that was uh it was something that uh you know was brought to my attention and the issue was not a question of the questions because the system that we had actually are so as they continue to upgrades on the senses that they provide our system would not be upgrade and I think it will just not be uh supported so we had to make a decision at some point we didn't say did nothing this year but it is in our budget so I feel apologize to do that so at some point that will be on and I'm sure you'll be hearing more about this uh and hopefully there will be more for on a website for the citizens so that they can access more information with the services that they received from from the from the town of office so there'll be more to come on there I'm sure we'll look so happy that it's going to be a while we're trying to be cute any questions okay um I just wanted you saw the uh demo from Mike on the fire department donation I think you know the significance of the donation is not so much uh 300 300 from Harbor Freight but it's the fact that you know I'm afraid to feel reached out they want to support our First Responders and it's the way Mike and his staff are looking at that and how they're going to utilize that money which is going to even save more money down the road in terms of being inconvenient with my equipment uh so I mean I think it's that kind of forward thinking that you know you can you can say something and you would just expand upon it so it doesn't cost citizens any money but it increases the uh the ability to provide services without having exponential increase in cost together I'm sure you guys looked at it and read it it's uh you know it's just another great thing uh you know for these guys so English to him um I you saw the uh um we've uh you know courtesy or Prescott were able to get into the format so that we could make it our own you know very generous in working with us and they have been going along uh Tony is I've got Tony Mike in a lesser degree um looking at how uh their different departments are impacted by us having this I think that what we need if we're going to introduce this organism what we need to be doing is having a system in place so that if and when it is approved uh if somebody wants to be able to utilize this uh Tony will have a packet have a checklist of the things that you need to have out of the application that has the appropriate information so it can make it easy for people to be able to go step by step to do the things that we need to do and also make it easier for you know the people who are code enforcement officer the police chief and buyer chief uh to make sure that things are being in compliance with the ordinance so there's just a little work that needs to be done and my hope is is that we will have something to give to you in August in passport to be introduced and then we'll go through the cover says the public hearings the only other thing that I sort of bring up under uh reports is um the uh there's actually two more things but one of the things that is it really has been some teenage Behavior Hotel property that is um and it has created the problem I'm trying for him to try to provide uh Parks and Rec services to the kids to swimming pools and escorts uh it's been a problem for the police because of the belligerent in a very inappropriate behavior in unfortunately I think that there are some things that we may need to do in order to um in order to in order to curtail that behavior from continuing and I know I thought that just address it briefly because basically a good good evening Council basically we've just been receiving an influx of inappropriate behavior at the basketball and tennis courts that have acquired our response and our attention I think that we it would be incumbent upon us and the council or you could probably just delegate it to us to complete making some sort of rules and standards in place as to what people can and can't be doing um in these public areas that the town tries to provide services in we had an instance a few days ago where we had I think tennis lessons and swimming lessons going on and there were some disruptive people in there and they were confrontational with Recreation director which in turn caused us to become involved and then it just created a an issue that we're just we've been dealing with way too frequently this summer so I think we need to just maybe put up a sign set some rules and uh and just work at enforcing those rules then sure thank you that was that was the tamed down version you know if I just listen I just wanted to make it just make it you know public knowledge that you know we just we cannot tolerate this in our town we just hate and um you know and there are I just know I mean I read the email for the dog from that and it's just like to feel my blood pressure a little bit and these things inappropriate as well yes is it always the same same group of people that's causing the problems or is it different ones generally it's a small minority but I can tell you they are they are rude improved and it's just we just we just cannot have this we just can't yeah I just think you know the Citizens need to be aware of it people need to speak up when they see them and um you just need to curtail that who loves complicated food if you have a parent calling and complaining because the police officer address your child yeah it's a problem it really is I wonder if it's the same I had a an issue with some kids on Main Street during the festival and kind of Cheryl did as well put the run to him move on down um and they were very belligerent and kind of yeah you know we all play a role in so the other thing is is that you see those packages which I need you to turn back on but I wanted you I asked so this is uh this is a part of this King a result of the meanings that we've had with Catherine in the group uh is it is a package that anyone who takes out papers uh could be a counselor um is it's a way for us to have contact information so we need to contact them plus also it outlines the responsibilities and duties and things that people need to be thinking about if they actually really Excel uh neither did that on her own after attending a meeting with Catherine and I thought she did a great job yeah I just wanted you guys to see that um and we have movies able to um pick up petitions July 31st coming up that would have been nice to have in January a beg your partner that would have been nice to have in January thank you okay okay all business yeah um so you guys have already faults have already approved uh letter engagement felchin company yes I was present money uh and the reason is that you need to attack another three thousand dollars on there because Tony is actually handled about 844 000 uh worth of additional funds of federal funds a lot of that has been through the utility system they've got a cdbg grant and Tony has administered that and if we administer if the community ministers over 750 000 they haven't bought a single audit down which is either required environment of your annual audit is is quite a bit of additional work for the Auditors kids the additional three thousand so one of the good things is that Tony was proactive enough to get five thousand dollars as an administrative fee from the cwg grant so that money what last year what we did receive funds to help cover costs over three thousand so I would ask the council to approve the amended contract which includes an additional three thousand dollars so cool second any questions or questions all in favor definitely I will die thank you very much um welcome thank you hi everyone hello I'm Catherine Ingraham I live in Parham but don't hold that against me um I am here to just answer some questions and talk a little bit about the final report of the community empowerment project we started off in March with individual interviews um I spoke to 23 different members of the community including council members department heads Crown staff interested folks who wanted to participate to learn a little bit more about the culture report Fairfield as far as business in the town office and meetings and stuff was concerned from those interviews we got a working group together people to come together and talk about some solutions that the town could take some actions moving forward to help avoid some of the things that have happened in the past and just create you know more in-depth and better relationships with the council with staff the department heads and offer folks different Pathways to achieve the shared goals and experiences of making foreign so I have from that um seven recommendations to share with you these were vetted for 30 days in an open public open comment period to the public um you should have copies of the 20-page report I sent you because I'd love to send you guys lots and lots of literature to read um sorry about that but there are and there are some graphs that show of the uh a little bit of confusion around some of the language on some of the items which is understandable um certainly the one about amending the town Charter is to create a super majority for passing the budget for for borrowing more than 250 000 I could have done a better job describing like legal language and stuff like that or just sharing it with people um I didn't so my apologies there but uh yeah so I think tonight I'm here to just share that most of the comments were positive you did receive copies of all of the comments um in their unedited versions as well so if you've had a chance to take a look at those if you have any questions about any of that stuff I'm happy to answer it to the customer my ability and I wasn't certain if you wanted to kind of tackle these one-on-one or um all together so I know the um the town Charter has to be by ordinance so that will be a separate issue but as far as the other six recommendations are concerned and then I do also have um just a few names to share with you for folks who were part of the working group who volunteered to continue helping with other things that you may need help with in the future and they have indicated kind of so do you want to we're not voting on this we just want to have discussions about who um I think it would be good for the councils to talk about whether to talk about these eventually but it's everybody's thoughts uh number one recommending adding regular standing agenda items at Town Council meetings for department heads to present any Department specific updates thoughts or it's a lot of agenda yep [Laughter] that particular action had 26 comments and 24 of 26 degrees yeah that's a good idea yep how about the recommendation for the town council department heads Town manager and when appropriate Town staff to attend and participate in an annual retreat I mean I think after my thoughts on it yeah it depends on the retreat good luck go to America how long does it last and we'll fish in rear machine I don't know this is something that I mean you but the whole the intent of getting everybody together is to just to get a it's a it's it's a combination of a working knowledge of of what everybody's role is and but it's also just getting to know people so this doesn't have to be expensive really when maybe retrieve is not a good word to use but really what it means is is that you're getting the tone dancer you're getting the department heads possibly some staff through the council together in one room and you're talking about managing this town and the responsibility it's not just responsibility that you have the responsibility that you thank you and what you think Darren's responsibility is so you guys are going to talk about that this is an opportunity for people just to be able to talk so also I think it gives you an opportunity to help fine-tune their your your group a little bit better too this would make you a stronger team right right one of the things that I noticed when we do when we have the um that we've always done the department head presentation for the work of the for the for the budget and and really there's just not enough and part of it is is that we just don't have this commonality we just don't know each other yeah look it can be you know you don't want to spend a lot of money you don't need to spend a lot of money it's not about that but it's about just getting single together you're talking you need more people there just needs of better communication they'll still transparency as well right I think everybody helps build transparency absolutely yeah I was going to say that a lot of the comments about this we're in line with what um counselor is talking about in terms of you know the cost isn't anticipated there's ambiguity around the word um Retreats when we spoke about this in a working group we were intentionally vague about that to allow for flexibility for the council to make a determination on what's appropriate for that given year so think of it more as like a workshop as well not a retreat like we're not going to go down to Sunday River and we rope climbing together probably but it would be like a working session as well you can talk about the cost but look at the cost that we just went through this past year because we didn't have that line of communication think about that cost that's right it's a hell of a lot more than a freaking meal I love this products thank you uh recommendation for the Town Council to include a public comment period at the end of at the end of Council meetings for a trial period lasts in three months yeah kind of recap what we what we go over what's your thoughts Pat I'm just wondering if we're going to do it for three months do we then bring it back up and talk about it see how it went see if we want to continue it I think we're going to know yeah do we have a mechanism in place or does it matter well as it is a try as a trial period in three months yeah but then we'll have to make a determination whether or not we want to continue so I'll let you make the motion is it emotion no no no no we're just discussing it thanks yeah uh how about the recommendation to include probationary period and Provisions detailed job duties and responsibilities in the contract for the town manager to include an annual performance evaluation who would do is the evaluation counselors I can't believe it it's in their contracts to see that that happens so we see that it happens but how do we go and you're that's something you'll be discussing with an Excel manager okay it's just a question of you know how how specific do you want your contract to be and it really is going to be a discussion between you in the next health manager what's that what that's going to look like but there are it was clearly a recommendation that this is part of the process moving forward yeah and that was a good a lot of good feedback on that one only one person disagreed with it yeah 26. yeah uh recommendation that an attorney for the town a Ford Fairfield review the final language before the town manager's contract is finalized I agree with that one yeah yeah I think that was always under the bat um I can't I can tell you that the contracts that I had was earnings were not involved you know they were pretty basic contracts so we're done for 10 years yeah I was gonna say how'd that last one even slide through like that [Music] me either how about the amendment to the town Charter recommending amending voting current language no action of the council except that's provided in the preceding Senate shall be binding or valid unless adopted by affirmative vote of three or more members of the council many language to include for the annual budget borrowing over 250 000 higher the town manager and sign the employee contract or contract renewal for the town manager an affirmative vote of a super majority of four counselors is required for items to pass um should be within my mind there's a motion table not proportion of the recommendations until an ordinance can be drafted that would include that language has it changed the genre that could be introduced yeah public hearing discussion and then yeah both okay yeah no that's that's good but I do think that there should be discussions in the first place yeah if you if you want to do it then repeatedly will do exactly what somebody said but you need to decide do you want to do a super to change the chart you're changing the charter to a super majority for these actions is that something that you want to do if you do get staff and prepare that ordinance but I think you should say yeah yeah we had to think further ahead and think back of what happened with some of the bolts that that's taking place that might have been a big issue yes okay in other words I don't want it that way did you think about that yeah seriously yeah so we've had major issues such as approving a budget in the past that would have required if we change this and we we require a super majority of four and we don't get there how long does that get how long do we continue to drive that dude the point is that you've got to get there or nothing would happen exactly so we either create a stalemate or are we work together and make things happen yeah I mean we don't need to finalize anything right right you know what okay the discussion right now it's something you think that's what we want to do yeah so we'll do we need a motion the table no okay okay yeah we'll just table we'll table that one and uh number seven I recommend that the Town Council charge the budget advisory committee to work with the Council on adopting a new budget process for the next fiscal year I'll be in favor of that yeah yeah at that point yeah just to let you know I've already talked with uh with Jason his plan is to have a meeting sometime in August with the hotel manager in the budget advisory here for next year so this will obviously be part of that discussion what were the comments about that for the budget committee uh that was awesome yeah 23 to three in favor of um there are some confusion but they were more directed at the budget itself rather than the budgeting process um so I'll let you read those in your own time what about on the one previous about the charter the amendment to the Charter so that one a number of people didn't answer again I think just my presumption because the language was confusing and some people actually did comment that they didn't understand what that meant so there's a limitation there but there were 21 people that voted for it overall 18 were in agreement and three were in disagreement for it and the ones who are in disagreement generally wanted the 250 000 to be lowered to either amount that can change based on what the town could afford um you know they mentioned specifically a hundred thousand dollars two hundred thousand dollars so it was more about that number I think and confusion than anything else generally it seemed like people who voted in favor were okay with that concept any other questions for Catherine nope thank you thank you thank you what are you taking out there um so the because we need Council to to make them make a motion to either approve to seven approve one two five you know seven um implementing them if you're interested in by by well number six if you if you vote to move forward what you're voting to do was is for us to create an ordinance and then obviously the integers at the next council meeting there'll be a public hearing and then you'll go to that ordinance uh at the next meeting which will be the September 21 that's the way we did that um if you I mean if you table it is however the council wants more so it's an actionable item you need to council pick up on these seven items okay if uh if of course this this is a lot of information for one meaning I myself could answer how I would feel on maybe three of them totally but I would rather put more time in And discussing a little more uh amongst us before I answer any of them I I hate to be that way personally I would I would table it and we can vote on it next month if we can yeah is that sure yeah we got a motion in a second all right yeah hi yeah all right yeah um and that is all we have for all business under new business we have been asked to create an ordinance that will amend the fort Fairfield zoning coordinates which will conclude the further development of Apartments that is the that's the Crux of what this ordinance does so all we need is someone um to introduce this orders Mr chair I make a motion we accept ordinance number 23-10 just because there's no point it would just need somebody that's interesting yeah um we have someone who's interested in looking at the pool Drive Department that has become tax requirement it's a three-partner building uh I had no idea what shape it's in it's been bacon for a while and it's tax required um and so the I I'm asking the council to allow us to approve allowing us to sell it so I went to I had a meeting Friday with the missile Association and Kate blooper from MMA was there and she shared with me and Mark was responsible for this I just want you to know he didn't uh we have all new rules about how we dispose on tax required property yeah I just called New Yorker administer examples thank you very much honestly this is it's just you know it is no she's here somewhere you know so I gave it to her I said fix it um so basically you know I sent you the language of the state statute and so you've seen it's going to be basically what it means is that we have to contact the forward order and let them know that we're doing it and we have to give them three months we have to then list them with the realtor uh for I would think it's three months but I'm quite sure she's we're still trying to be as in three months six months right you know it can't be anybody who was who is been appointed by the time to do something oh because you were my first choice um and and then what we do is basically what it means is is that we tally up all the costs associated with the back taxes the interests the you know the they have a list of things and any money that we get Beyond there has to move back to the prior Holdings so that's the so basically what we're doing is we're tasked with disposing of this property is something that they were not willing to do and then once our costs are covered if there's any money left over then it goes from there which is what would have happened anyway if they just put it on insults right anyway it's just it's frustrating and I think the state legislature for their thought process and all that but despite all that I am asking with Council to allow it to uh sell the pool dry property one of the reasons why we accepted a tax required because the thought was is that we would tear down the building and we created an additional parking lot for exclusively so we had a staff meeting Doug and I we talked about it it would always be nice to have more parking but it's not something that it's a it's a dire need right now uh staff overwhelmingly felt overwhelmingly felt that yet that property could be rehabbed then that would be the best use for the town because we do need apartments and they're not on Main Street so um so anyway the the consensus of staff is that we should sell it if somebody's willing to buy it and they are going to renovate it and turn it into some decent units I said Motion in the second any discussion yeah motion a second any other questions Kevin hi hi Jim Bob hi not all right thank you very much uh and then the last thing is just a perfunctory um each year uh maintenance Association puts together um a slots uh people for slots available for election uh for their executive committee and their officer so in this case it's the vice president of the three executive committee members uh they have prevented us with the Slate we are asked to vote on it uh assets percentage please any discussion all those in favor aye thank you and that's all I have okay

managers position Jimbo motion second all those in favor aye [Applause] words so I didn't write a speech and uh and I barely got dressed I'm in the process of renovating my house right now and the raspberry patch called me so I think it almost got here a little late because the raspberries are only right but for a certain a certain number of days a year um you know it's uh it's an exciting opportunity I I grew up here I went to school here um brought my family back here almost nine years ago my wife was here my kids go to school look here my mom lives on Prescott Street this town means a lot to me to see what we've gone through these past several years has been difficult for sure and I'm sure it's been even more difficult for our department head tonight and certainly our Council has seen what we've gone through and hopefully uh you know through all of our leadership it's not just one person it's not just one Department it's all of us working together we'll be able to move this community forward I'm really really excited to to get started there's going to be a little bit of a delay as I transition out of my current role but I think it's really served me well to have this opportunity these past six years since I worked for the town so have my cup of coffee municipal government and I feel bad to not address you guys yes but realistically I I just uh we've got a lot of work to do um you know it's it's nice to celebrate the wins when we have them certainly Dan and all the department heads in our in our residents need a you know to take a deep breath and realize we've come through a pretty bad storm um and we've come out the other side of it but now we've got a lot of work to do I don't need to tell Darren that there's a lot of roads that need Haven because I'm sure Darren will tell us there's a lot of Roads and you know we know the rec programs that Doug and his crew are working on are well received and part of what keeps us as as parents uh same through the summer um and let alone uh wanting to call this our home our school system we can't even forget they're the biggest chunk of our Municipal budget um you know we've got a lot of work to do with them with new leadership there uh with Tania as the new superintendent and Garrett is living principal so there's a lot going on in Port America but I'm just really excited about this opportunity um because there is a lot going on and we have a lot to be proud of and a lot to be positive about and a lot to build on and so I just thank you I'm humbled for this opportunity overwhelmed a little bit at the same time but it's not just me I want to see all you guys in this room I just look forward to working with you guys taking your input and your advice and seeing what we can do to make this down a better place to live and grow our kids and grow old but I'm very excited to get started and we'll hit the ground running in October so awesome very good all right thanks any questions concerns thank you thank you I guess I guess I'm just a little upset that the newspaper left he jotted down all the notes there about Dan talking about the riffraff down at the basketball courts but he didn't want to talk he didn't want to hear about our new town manager okay yeah all right a motion to adjourn motion second all those in favor thanks hey thanks man I look forward to having a very long,True

the floor is open for Public public comment period three minutes and come to the podium state your name Hamilton Avenue a year ago things were pretty bleak in this town and I'm not going to rehash everything that transpired then but uh I stand here tonight as part of a group of like-minded individuals called the forefather revitalization project and I don't want to step on councilwoman candidates toes but um one of the ideas that we came up with was um a Fridays and 40 event and I've given a copy of the flyer into the Madam Clerk what it is is it's a group of citizens uh or go into lead a community initiative aimed at hosting local businesses and attracting Adventures to this town I guess we're going to kick it off Friday July 7th from 5 to 8 pm on the Village Square parking lot just coincidentally the the chamber is going to have a 10 set up there so we'll be utilizing that tent at night we hope to have three food trucks that night and right now we have about 13 vendors lined up and um it might not necessarily be the first value every month but we hope to have a Friday night event once a month bring it to keep the tax dollars in the town floor Fair we're going to have a DJ that night um we're often have a farmer's market I think we're looking to have the Amish okay thank you um so there's a lot of talent in the in this town local Artisans so we're the goal is perhaps to at some point maybe a system with a co-op whether if they don't want to have a standalone business themselves perhaps they can go in within other individuals and have a co-op and have seller wears that way some of the other ideas are a multi night a Fall Fest that's a sort of soup contest she doesn't know this yet but we're hoping to assist him on the Children's Parade I don't think he's still object um a chili cook-off um and we're hoping to align with the fort Fairfield Council places and I may have more to say later when Patton addresses everyone but uh I'll be here um well first of all let me introduce some of the members of our bank Hotel committee Pat canavan is here Laurie the Congress Scott is there green Clover is here Elizabeth Green Brook is here and we also have Shelly Everett thank you very much no again our goal is to stop the tax dollars from going out of town I'll leave that because I may have more to say later thank you thank you thank you it's just anybody else okay Dan you put the floor thank you Mr chairman correspondence and Records under license and permits I would ask the council to approve the renewal if the license for Boondocks all those in favor aye thank you very much financial report um I have to say that I was a little nervous about June and I can say now on June 21st that I didn't mean to be we're doing really well um we've already paid 250 000 towards our five hundred thousand dollars uh to the bank on that line of credit we will get the other 250 000 paid at the end of the month so the 500 000 will be taken care of we have about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or so left in bills that will be paid this year um and that will probably leave us between three and four hundred thousand dollars left in the bank for going into July we will not need to use our line of credit right off even though uh Keith and I will be signing it on July 5th just in case uh but the bank was adamant that we pay down for 500 000 and we can do it we can get our bills paid we're not carrying any expenses over into next year which is a real plus and I know the department is our ecstatic about that uh and you will have money in the bank starting off the new year so I I feel like that's a real positive step for the town um and you know it's with a lot of relief for me that we were able to to uh to to get this all accomplished you know a lot of things goes to the employees and department heads I mean they've really been over backwards to make this work and uh you know I'm very very grateful for that so it's a It's Been a Good Year I didn't start out that way but it's been a very good year so I'm feeling very good any questions on the financial Steve holistic Waste Solutions uh AWS met on April 30th as a as at the end of April we were our income was below budget by about 12 percent uh that varies from time to time our actual biggest customer that we have is contracted to a minimum amount per year so that's not something we really worry about they are the ones that are a little bit behind but they'll catch up during the course of the year before us our expenses were also done with 14 which is kind of what upsets that helps us a lot we had a meeting with wood and Kearns representative Jim Wilson they're the people who are setting up sales five and six for us that's the beginning of our new source of revenues when we start filling out those two new cells they update us on what weather final budgets are coming in at it's coming around 6.8 million dollars to build those two cells uh the original estimates were around 5.7 million uh there's been some inflation stuff we were able to save quite a bit of money by buying our liner ahead of time we did something very Innovative we actually brought our contractor on board without going to bid ahead of project that way we can get some things nailed down ahead of time and get the ball rolling in case we get 100 weather we all felt that probably that increase in the budget would have been surpassed by more than that if we were going out to be today just trying to find help and getting construction works is so hard we were all locked in last summer on that so we felt good about to have um our foreman Marcus had some medical issues for quite a while I don't know if you're aware of this Dean but they've made the end of the new Fallout there because it looks like products can go over quite a while still and you may not be able to function fully at that position when he goes back so we're working very closely with Mark he's a very good employee and they'll always have something there for him so we just want to pass that along to you guys um Prescott landfill is closing Friday this week so everything's going to be shuffling order for refill from there uh we're almost all set for just regular traffic between the Presque Isle three days a week regular people who want to bring their local trash interesting we have to work to publish on Saturdays that's all been set up and put in place we ordered our scrap metal out for 140 a time while Mike has to knowledge of that that's actually put a high note so all in all things are pretty well out there I'm hoping now that things are kind of settle down with the budget Dan and I can sit down and spend some more time looking at the possibilities of the pipeline for the leaching uh Mark and Paul just as of April we had shipped over three million gallons to the Caribou Utilities District to be processed that's normally what our year volume is that's so much more rain we've had this year so I still think it's a priority for official Council and for us to reevaluate the possibility of having some of that come especially where we have a new system going place so we'll keep you up to date on that one any questions uh so Steve uh so how many more loads will be coming through for forever those loads to come through for Fairfield and they go through Caribou to get to the landfill ah it really depends on what the road stuff for picking up stuff um traffic will be coming down I think that we will look at a traffic increase of around 30 because that's if we if we looked at the numbers uh the amount of stuff going into the landfill that would come before Fairfield percent is about 30 more that will be getting a period of time so um and like I said I can find it definitely sure some of those lows probably won't go through cable I think maybe yeah sometimes it's easy to take the truck route that way rather than come through their roads Prescott Street it's in pretty bad shape to be honest with you you know if they go straight forward from Prescott and come back around the back side of dodos it's easy to drive yeah so we can put signs up though thank you guys very much thanks Steve um well the church yeah we have um our department here tonight who will be addressing the council will be done sharp uh John is finishing up his third month he's coming out of probation um and uh by all measures I've done a great job so I thought you could uh you could talk to him and he's been busy the last couple of days the pools open gym School yeah how's it going Doug good good good A little sunburn but good uh so I'm just going to give you guys a little bit of update uh since you guys really haven't had an update since probably March so a little update from March until now uh good evening Council it's been a busy few months since I was appointed department head of the recreation department back in March my first line of business was to get the Department uh reorganized in my liking get acclimated with the Department's current and future budget and continue running as many programs as possible as scheduled we finished out our winter and spring programming with our rec basketball grades fourth or sixth boys travel team winning the county championship and our indoor soccer program where we had approximately 90 participants uh next order business uh began working with Chief jailbear and other department heads to renew our dance hall permit this took a big effort from all all department heads and I'd like to take the time to thank chief jailbear for stepping up and leading the process after meeting with the fire marshal for inspection there were only minor Corrections needed in each department with that I'm happy to say we were grant our dance our permit last week this will allow us to host large events that may include a DJ or band and allow service organizations and for fairfield-based Community groups to hold fundraising events here once again between the dance hall permit process and spring programming it was time to start planning for summer programming staff we knew we were going to run into some issues as everyone I've talked to not only in Riverside County but the entire state were desperate for lifeguards after losing lifeguards last year and a pool director we knew it would be difficult to find new help we were able to hire two new lifeguards along with four returning guards these six guards with a newly hired summer program assistant were willing to cross train in many areas of the department making us able to cover all programming events this summer I would like to personally and publicly thank them for stepping up to the plate and adjusting to help make our summer program impossible our pool's up and running in great shape we've had a few bumps in the road this year getting our pool system up and running after 15 years our chlorinator pumps decided it was time to go when we were starting them up to my understanding they were the original ones from day one that it was built aside from that just some minor electrical work and we're back up and running everything else looks pretty good our summer programs look to be busy we have 30 events and programs lined up between now and early to mid-august after going over registration forms we anticipate seeing hundreds of participants through regular scheduled programs special events and Festival activities this week alone we have we had our state track meet in Presque Isle this past Monday where we had 40 local residents participating against other County Recreation departments where there was over I think a total of 300 plus participants very well attended our Pool opened up yesterday for the season um very busy today and yesterday as it's finally starting to get warm up there um we are hosting the nmcra regional Pitch hit and run event here in Fort on Friday for all Arusha County Recreation departments so we anticipate that to be a busy event as well this Friday and then we'll also be very involved with a second annual nmcra golf scramble in Mars Hill Country Club supporting the nmcra and Recreation in Russia County I'd like to take a little a little bit of time to mention our coaches and volunteers I'd like to publicly thank all the coaches staff and volunteers for stepping up and making summer program impossible thanks to these people our little league our minor league our Pony League our junior girls softball tennis swim team Outdoor Adventure programming and many more were all possible because of them this is what our community is all about and I'm happy to say that in our little town of Fort Fairfield there's always somebody uh willing to lend The Helping Hand and thanks to all of

well Dan had asked me if I would give a brief update and no one he knows me for years yeah and I don't say anything briefly but I like to think I say it nicely so I said to be honest and keep myself honest my promise to to Dan I I wrote my thoughts out and I timed them so I should be within my time on it Dan you can let me know yes um it's a pleasure to be your your director um it's uh I've told everybody it's labor of love I'm a HomeTown girl even though I've lived in Prescott now for 54 years um I'm still a fort Fairfield girl still that farm girl that lived out Alexandria Road uh so my heart will always be here in Fort Fairfield one way or another and I found my way back several times to do the festival and this time I really didn't want to see Dan have a nervous breakdown so I said I would stay another year so anyway I would give you this is just my brief update thank you uh you're welcome uh we are now two and a half weeks away from the festival First first day this year will be July 7th which will start the festival with go golf tournament really exciting event from there we have 67 events with the festival last day being July 16th with our awesome fireworks show Community for Fairfield can take great pride in be in the host Community excuse me for this now 76 year old tradition that salivates our agricultural roots um the festival has grown into a now nine-day event which attracts visitors from all of the United States this year and then this year Canada the festival is a member of the main tourist Association and is a valuable Source in tracking visitors interests and travel plans for the past two years visitors are increasing in large numbers to northern Maine and we have seen those increases of the festival as well this translates into a huge economic impact for our area the festival was awarded a ten thousand dollar Grant this year the main office of Tourism which is being used to fund our Festival Facebook page upgrades and a whole new Festival website which were badly needed as social media is where you can now promote events like the festival and be able to know how many potential visitors may be planning to attend in preparing for the grant Hampton Inn in Presque Isle send a letter of support to be included and they stated that they are completely booked the week before festival and the week up Festival so this shows us that the festival has a wide value not just a Court Fairfield but surrounding communities they buy gas they shop while they're a year so and along with Fort Fairfield too you know if one businesses are here they welcome that extra dollar when it comes Festival uh other funding for the grant will go to fund the cost of our brochures advertising and photography um I I don't think many fully realize the true value of this event not only to the community of Fort Fairfield but to the surrounding communities as well is it a lot of work to plan this event yes it truly is for sure but I can say for being your Festival director now going on five years that there's great support for this event from the many faithful sponsors volunteers Town departments and staff as well as the community as a whole who act as a team to make this event happen every year our Festival t-shirts and hands are ready and are on sale at the town office as well as Festival headquarters when open our Grocers and booklets will be distributed next week Chamber of Commerce will be helping me um uh to distribute the brochures in the central rustic area and I will be supplying for Fairfield Festival headquarters will be held in the historic Key Bank building volunteers will be Staffing it as they are available Pat and I took a tour wasn't it Grand huh just a beautiful building that I so wish could be utilized a lot of history a lot of memories but it's going to make a beautiful headquarters for us one of my greatest rewards of being your Festival director is knowing that this event brings

people in the wings yeah and that's been great but it's good for the school department been for the Middle High School it was always sort of publicly congratulate Garrett for that uh for that news for some responsibilities for our youth um I just wanted to let you know that on the speed limit sign I showed you the um application that Sergeant Jesse told me for together and so we are we now have an application in with mgot for the signs that they have it's uh I talked to the chief about that he says it's a process for the up to two years up to three years wow so the thought is that if uh he can't pull any strings like he said he could uh that it come this fall before school starts and then what we will do is we will get the sign that uh Chief coming for us we'll get that and we'll get that uh uh these the the MDOC signs are much more comprehensive so obviously when we are able to get them up and hopefully that will help with some of the concerns that we've heard from professors if you have any questions you're not fighting bison raised um we started discussion about putting some protection in place for the community and residents of the community in regards to uh bison I've had many conversations with um officials in Augusta from the Department of Agriculture and one of the big things that came out of the conversation was realizing the loopholes in the regulations in the laws regarding um that type of animal used for agricultural purposes they differentiate between wild bison and domesticated bison I haven't found the difference yet in my dealings with them but um so I spoke with um the director uh a director in Augusta that I've been speaking with the whole time and they're going to start the process of reviewing everything um we have we have talked about language for an ordinance but I think it would be wise to wait to see what they come up with in Augusta for regulations and still do some work on our end um you don't need to rush and we can we can take our time and do what's right and see what we could push Augusta to do for us and I think that would be the best bet if not then we'll come up with our own and present it and hopefully we can get a working group of of community members together to try to I mean hit all the areas that we need to hit regarding this I mean we don't want to we don't want to punish uh everybody for the Deeds of one so I think we just really need to take our time and be thoughtful with what we're doing with it yeah no I don't think so I mean I do think that it clearly it should be an obligation of the state they have the resources and they have the SDS right which we have but unfortunately we have this in our community you know the state doesn't step up so I do think that Matt's approach is appropriate with Google and I think you know he's working with Department of Agriculture uh and he's keeping the Clinton center with them which I think is important they understand the significance they end off like what happened to have 13 Animals Adam in the way that they were put down nobody was happy with that at all but you're not going to put a rope no I'll keep kind of being that fly in the ear to them for the next few weeks to make sure we get some some progress done I'm really good at that so yeah um there's a group of hunters like formal committee after help them keep them under control right right are there any there are no adult bison left no no there's some more calves in the department of the Department of Agriculture cultures okay because he got plans to bring more I don't know I would suspect he would like to like his farm going I'm not sure what the Dynamics are at this point with that we'll see okay that's why we need to be prepared we have two years so before they're full fully grown and you know we're back into the same predicament we were in over the winter yeah Bob could probably show you how to ride one of those things [Laughter] yes these three revitalization yes well Charlie gave us a little bit of it gave you a little bit of an update back when I heard that Walgreens was closing I made a post on the Facebook page that said it's time to start doing something we're losing too much in our town and we need to start doing something positive to put stuff back so I had a great response to that and it took me a while to follow up on it but I did and we have a pretty good Core group of six or seven people we've invited the chamber director lenise to be part of this and she's pleased to do that as well um we've got some members from the quality of place Council on this revitalization project group and we're talking about ways to make Fort Fairfield a business friendly community and bring businesses in we know we have a long ways to go we have some infrastructure to work on we have some different things to look at different ways to come up with ideas um we've started with Fridays in Fort because not only is it giving us an Avenue to invite businesses in it also gives us an Avenue to increase the energy in the town and bring some excitement to town there's a lot of people that are a little bit disappointed in town and feeling like we're going downhill and nothing's coming back um I'm going to always try to turn that negativity into something positive so part of what we'd like to do is the Fridays and fourth thing the other part of our discussion is also to work on developing a vision statement and work on developing a plan that involves more than a year or two but a long-term plan to help grow Fort Fairfield not just downtown but also within it with the industrial park bringing businesses in bringing small businesses in and any other business that might be interested in coming to our town we'll need to do some things to change things around a little bit make it a little bit more inviting and friendly and open and we're working on that and we intend very much to involve the rest of the council and the town as much as we can quality of place Council it's going to take a community to build this community back and that's what we want to do I think you got a great start we can answer any questions we're welcoming new members anybody who'd like to join um we're not meeting tomorrow night but next Thursday we'll be meeting at the public library we meet downstairs in the community room we're not I mean if I'm in the chair yeah go right ahead um we're actually meeting at Philly Square because we're actually going to see where our event is going to be held so we're meeting in the parking lot okay okay so we'll be meeting on this on the sixth at Villa Square parking lot okay I'm so lost it's a 31st isn't it for the 30. okay it's next Thursday okay so if anybody wants to you know come in and see what we're talking about see what we're all about or join and whatever you're welcome to work okay thank you um I I just I received this uh in the meal for other County Commissioners [Music] award for Fort Fairfield um I put this on the agenda and I got a nice email from Bill Christensen saying I think the council's already recognized this in February 22. and I thought I wasn't here and I said we'll do it again uh [Music] is invited at the celebration that they're going to have the northeastern Hotel I think it's a great thing let's say and quality police council is is a is a valuable valuable group to this community and it's one that this child needs to support when I say each other I'm talking about the local government we need to support uh just like you need support but that in her group are doing um this we are we're here to serve the community and um and this is a group that that has hung in there for thick and thin and I'm just I'm just thankful that they're still here so kudos to them uh there is nndc is having their annual meeting tomorrow morning at a convenient time for Kevin uh Bouchard so he and I talked about it and I will be going uh tomorrow morning and attending that meeting normally there later in the day uh meetings which is more convenient for him so I told him what a problem I can do that and I will be there representing the child support Fairfield um this was kind of interesting I had no idea that this existed the Limestone subdivision rail use advisory Council requests foreign so basically there is a real line that runs from the Caribou from Fort Fairfield the lord it's how they got their coal with over that Railway now railing has not been used for years um and so this organization was formed at least it's my understanding based on what I've read was formed to determine what to do with that right away but to do the rail is still there whether you can keep it pull it up you know do something different anyway the reason why I received this was because that whole thing is getting shelled because of what's going on at flooring right now uh the development that's going on over there and so they are now looking at possibly putting that rail back to use so I just thought that was just a subtle thing that just kind of said you know there's something really going on over there and I and if if half of what happens what they're planning on doing if it actually does it's going to be great for this whole area it'll be grateful for it it'll be great for you know all the communities uh not just not just learning so I just want to throw that on there just let you guys know that there really is something going on in uh Tony he attends all their meetings by zoom in fact they just said one today and Tony is cautiously optimistic that we've got some pretty good stuff going on over here what else can you can share any of that information sure um it's public knowledge that they've sold and leased out a bunch of buildings uh ring for Maine is the largest player so far there's a company that's going to be doing a a bioethanol fuel from wood and they're probably going to reuse the pipeline for that there's an awful lot going on by Steve Levesque trying to get aviation in there and that may happen there there are even thinking of uh using up some of the condemned structures for the Columbia like an automotive repair shop over there and then you know a building that hasn't been used since it closed over where the fuels where I just used to be on that there's a bunch of space that's been leased by others and you're still negotiating with more well it's just uh it was the most exciting meeting I've been to since 1993. well that's some good news and a lot of it's already in leases that he was talking today the gentleman that was giving green for Maine synopsis he was saying we've signed this nine-year lease 20 000 square feet we find this nine-year lease and 40 000 square feet where we were going to have a the solar farm is going to be there and they're going to have 120 Personnel that are going to be going back and forth to their offices it's just it's a win-win situation especially if they can bring on these Aviation which they're talking about launching things horizontally rather than vertically and it's because of the length of Runway over there when I was growing up we always thought that was the third largest Broadway in the world because of the hanger systems they have it makes it great for bringing stuff the horizontal launch he's going to open up some windows for the space industry here so I have a license here wow and there's been a cash infusion over there quite green for me and some others that's it yes matter of fact we're talking about closing their books this month in the black six months ago they were extremely rich that's that's some good news yeah it is good news it really it really is thank you thank you it's all positive that's what I like about it um the um you uh Doug briefly mentioned that Fire Marshals before deficiencies um we had a dog and Mike did a lot of the work uh Matt was involved um so anyway they got everything up up to speed car Marshall was signed off on it which is great and it's going to be good for the community and it's great that Doug is looking to help facilitate uh these events that Community organizations want to hold be able to use their building their facility for their events and if there's someone that we can accommodate it's exactly what we should be good so and I'm really pleased I mean I appreciate Doug's uh can do attitude by the way it needed work which is really great um and he and Mike did a lot of work getting really prepared for the uh for the report of the inspection by the Fire Marshal's office so I thought that was all really good the other thing too that it just kind of slides it kind of slid by at least for me is last year this is the first year last year was the first year you did this right device yes so Matt did this thing about looking for donations for bikes I'm going to give bikes to kids bikes and helmets so last year it was 150 57 fights I mean we had that many kids without flexible we gave up 57 bites last year all donations all organized by now uh and it was rarely run mostly through social media through Facebook so they did it this year how many bikes this year 78 wow wow that's not let's not be going and I cruise off uh that's often there for wanting to do it for taking the time to do it and organizing it and doing it is such a you know significant way it was not like giving up three or four bucks so anyway I just I didn't have it on the agenda oh yeah we need to talk about this is the community needs to know you guys certainly need to know that um that was that was when we had we had two citizens show up uh down here looking for bikes to put together so they you know people would bring bikes into boxes to the police station and people would show up and take them home put them together and bring them back stuff like that yes sir for a second yes sir I'd like to thank uh Terry Donovan and Paul Everett for putting the bugs together chief jalbert for giving us a place to uh to store them instead of being bugs been really wild Bay downstairs and then Chief Albert Sergeant Cormier uh numbered and photographed all the bicycles which reports own business um I would like to ask the council to approve ordinance 2306 which is a lease agreement with a little Sunshine Learning Center we have the public hearing we had seven people show up everybody felt very possible positively about it Tim in Joplin are working hard and getting the stuff together that they need with between the Fire Marshal's office and Department of Human Services it's a service that is is it really is needed in a big way before Fairfield people are looking forward to getting it there that facility we're not using it for anything that other departments have particular Eastport right now it's been used for that in the past set up for it and some good fit uh and Jacqueline and the Chandler here uh this evening and uh I want to thank them for stepping up and um looking uh to do this in Fort Fairfield Jack who's been very organized and doing a great job and Tim just does this his children so that so that all works very well so anyway does anybody have any questions I'd entertain a motion so moved on 2306 police agreement with Little Sunshine Learning Center all the favor all right ordinance 2307 to repeal ordinance 1708 for Imaging retail marijuana establishments so we were asked to present this to a while this retail activity to happen in Fort Fairfield uh so what we did is announced met with the police chief of West Scott they have six of these facilities in Presque is now the big concern was is it is it a public safety issue is it a public nuisance issue and um and that you can speak to this is what I in my discussion with Chief Kelly in Presque Isle they have pretty uh strict ordinance uh regarding the retail marijuana establishments I I viewed the ordinance I think it's appropriate they have a permitting process inspection and so on by code enforcement which I think is a good uh process and a if we're going to do something like this would be a good model to follow thank you I also talked with Ian Weebly who's the development director over there there it is you know they generate revenue from it from the from the uh licensing fees um and it has not created any kind of a negative backlash from the community which I think was a concern when this opportunity uh became available so it's understandable communities we're just going to hold back um I think that my attitude about stuff like this it's to me it's never a question of it it's a question of how I mean I just keeping businesses out of Fort Fairfield is going to prepare for his best interest but how businesses are managing for Fairfield is and so what I would recommend to the council is that you approve it and before I say that that's because and if we wanted to make sure that was anybody who was working who wanted to have an opportunity to speak to this either for or against it would have the opportunity we had nobody show up either for or against quinoa we received one very thoughtful letter from a couple who were concerned about what it might do to our community and again I understand that concern I respect their concerns I do think that you know we did our due diligence to determine how it adversely impacted other communities that currently are doing in Disney World so what I would recommend to the council is that we approve repealing it uh with the caveat that uh that Matt and I come back to the council with an ordinance um that will regulate how that industry will be utilized within our community is that for medical marijuana is that for just yeah it is and it's not just it's not just a plan that you smoke uh in those facilities I've been in it's as many that there's as much oils in gummy bears as there which which is taken for a whole variety of reasons you know people take it from arthritis issues you know I mean this is a lot of reasons why I personally know a few veterans that have some really producing problems a couple of Vietnam veterans uh that were on a lot of payments yeah and uh to the point where they weren't able to function so they resorted to uh gummies with the right kind of uh oil in it yes and yeah CBD and uh they're off payments so I guess it does work it does yeah discussion um we'll get a motion in a second any discussion Dan I want I did want to ask you real quick um the the Prescott give you any kind numbers as far as the the revenue generated off the uh of the licensing piece but I think that uh the licensing includes growing yeah so there are fees charged and I mean I think some of these were five thousand dollars I mean it was it was not insignificant so what we would be doing is we would be bringing uh an ordinance to the council for your consideration that would have a fee structure set up that probably would humidity there's no reason to recreate the wheel yeah um good good anymore okay we're going at the second you know it also a lot of people don't realize it it gives uh Society a chance to regulate and control the amount that's going through a community where right now there's not top of that it's uh it's a lot better handle and grips or law enforcement and whatnot and the state died on it so you know so very good anymore okay go to vote Kevin aye Pat hi Jim hi Bob hi and I vote on thank you um yeah I think this came from Jim really nice memo uh congratulating and thanking the budget advisory committee for all the work that they did on behalf of the community and um I thought it was really I thought it was great a certain thought was very appropriate um and I think you know these guys are just getting defeated uh they had I thought they had a pretty good year this year I think this year's leader would be better so we thought we put it we would put that uh Jen's memo into a proclamation and I would ask only a few of them you get the floor Proclamation 2309 final four Fairfield whereas the budget advisory committee Jason Barnes chairman Danielle Cody Billy Joe Sharp and Hull Steve rajeski Chuck Ainsworth have shown himself to be

upon this community and it's to the town of Fort Pierce budget advisory committee of the signatures of the poor Chicken Town Council thank you and I would ask for motion to improve this confirmation please any discussion Kevin Pat hi Jim hi can I vote thank you very much that's all I have on your own business under new business um it is a covenant practice for the town staff the closing office on June 30th so they've been complete their year-end work um Ella closes everything out they have their things that they have to do it's quite a process and then they have to get the computer system up and going for the movie starting July 4th so I would ask the council to approve closing the office in the public on June 30th to allow them to get this work completion second all those in favor aye aye thank you um we have um the letter of Engagement from from Belgium company to do our annual budget uh it's 500 higher than last year they do they're very confident they do a great job they've been

same line in 2324 appointments for Town officials and you have a list of the Town officials that uh that you require an annual degree appointment our road commissioner our health officers plumbing inspector code enforcement and sub registrar which is used for me and there's only time management 15 years and then the boards and committees that we have that new folks approved so I would ask for your approval of those positions go move motion second second any discussion I have a question yes there's a couple of advisory boards there are there's no time frames for them are they on it for life are they how does that work and when do they meet and what do they do Community Development Advisory Board if I'm ready for the chair yep chat the Community Development Advisory Board was created probably in the 70s and it was to utilize federal funds that were passing through to us because we were a commitment the size of the community that we didn't have to apply for funds and so they would respond to project activities and prioritize them for the town and we used to be fairly regularly when we were applying for cdb Grants and other grants frequently and we've had there were volunteers from around this community and if they wanted to become the Community Development Advisory Board they might be a manager at a bank they might be a manager at a grocery store they were actively busy in this community and had some responsibilities and they had some interest of all the department heads would be there and there was always federal and state delegation that would be part of it too so they hear what our priorities were for this town and they would throw their hats in support of us we still get credit for having an Advisory Board although there's no terms and we'll probably have to replace them we reactivate that board the other any other board that doesn't have any years beside it um the fair hearing Authority there's nothing on economic development board at all because there's no members I'm assuming so there isn't anymore the fear hearing is a function of the community when for the general assistance I believe if somebody is denied a general assistance voucher then they have the process for agreements procedure to have a fair hearing and I think they've met once in 35 years and it was people that were interested in hoping this community on a voluntary basis that was alternative attack okay those are the ones I know of so is there an opportunity or a hope that maybe this Community Development Advisory board can be restarted does it I mean you just go on forever I I don't know exactly so we're not getting grants before the applications for the complex which is where the client salt Center is on top of the hill in The Meadows housing complex and we were seeking funds from four or five different agencies in order to get the most benefit at the public hearings get voices there so we can build up our our storyline and to show the commitment of this community they will read reinvigorated but there's not a need as of today for them to have a meeting just to have a meeting okay but if there should become a reason then it's easy to do then we can reactivate it that's my question are you just schedule something and call those that are listed and fill in the blanks okay thank you okay so any more discussion in regards to the town officials board committee members motion a second okay vote Kevin Knight Pat hi Jim hi Bob hi I'm all right thank you very much um you I gave you a spreadsheet on uh Insurance uh I just I just got this um two days ago from uh from DJ so we have a quote from that big people ID for the the insurance is not include unemployment that's include workers it doesn't include the bond those are all separate um so these These are the insurances that we get from fap body their quote was 114 965 uh United insurance quote was 91 188 pretty significant yeah oh definitely yeah so uh I have um I have the coverages here uh I've gone over it with uh EJ he is more than willing to sit down and meet with Council if you want to uh if you would like to meet with him to go over this uh it's a small book um but I could tell you he worked very hard at it he was incredibly thorough and he kept asking for information and thank God for Department of this because it was it was a lot anyway I would highly recommend that we go with United Insurance for our insurance for next year I mean I uh as long as we're comparing Apples to Apples from the balls he's like absolutely motion okay any just questions or discussions bye thank you very much uh and the last thing that you're doing business is uh some Reserve account activity I work with the council to approve um we have we have a fair amount of money in administrative Reserve account I have no idea why we would have that much money we don't need it uh on the other hand the police department which can use it because of the things that they need to purchase primarily Vehicles has very little so I want to transfer fifty thousand dollars from the administrative Reserve account to the police Reserve account so they have the resources available to them so that when Matt is ready to get himself a new Cruiser he said the money to be able to purchase it so that's the first thing the other thing is that we have built into the budget uh a hundred thousand dollars uh for Public Works to be used to buy two f-550s so we that that's already been set into the budget uh uh or at least it's in our cash flow it's part of the cash flow the budget that you approved it's not it's not being funded through uh taxes it's money that we already have um what daring would like to do is he has in that 450 that he's got from drmo that is in great shape and it's got a boom on it that they can't use he wants to take it off and he wants to spend 8 500 to put a used plow hit here and wing on it and then look for one more F550 um so I he feels comfortable that this at 450 will do the job he's comfortable with the truck and um and so I'm asking the council to prove us use 8 500 on that hundred that's already been approved for uh the the plow headgear in Wing for the F-450 that he has and that we transfer 50 000 for the towards the budget children first okay yeah so what we're looking at is having three altogether so we have one right now so that we set the hundred thousand dollars aside four to two more f550s new ones can you buy new ones for fifteen thousand dollars well except for Matt thank you also not actually actually uh that you know the police chief has done a great job in finding very good deals in used Cruisers and you know and he's kept along the road and we're in great shape at some point he doesn't need to find a new one but to answer your question we bought I used F550 we used it this winter it worked great we want to do more of it uh of doing that but he's got this F450 that he would like to put the head here on and be able to use that which means then he only needs to buy one so what we're looking at is you folks approving the 8 500 for the end here the plow and the wing to put on the F-450 that he already has let's do the additional 190 000 that went into his budget the highway Department's budget uh it's coming down to the cash flows coming out of cash flow but it's we we had like a hundred thousand that's going to be for hot dogs that's separate yes sir it's interesting you mentioned paying though the reason the reason why we're trying to go with you is and the reason why we're we're trying to outfit this underutilized F450 well they're expensive but we'd like to I'd really rather use the remainder of that hundred thousand dollars I'd like to use about 50 of it to spend in equipment and I'd like to put the other 50 into a Paving project that would we'd like to get two miles of Paving in time which is I'd like to remind the council that that puts us on a 40-year Paving cycle on the roads that you drive on every day so we're going to be spend 50 000 on Paving and 100 000. we'd like to no no 150. okay I'd like to use the balance of that but we're getting up we're getting ahead of ourselves we are because we're not ready for that yet yep that that will not happen until we have a plan we'll bring it to the council and you guys will approve it the thing we're asking for approval right now is spend 8 500 for a plowing and head to your time as well that's already been we're not buying a truck today right and so when when he finds a truck and he wants to buy it they will be bringing that to the council right so then you you'll approve that then break that out it's just 8 500 for the plows 10 and gotcha so the the drmo that's a that's a state we don't have any money in that shipping oh shipping yeah oh good okay you got a motion in a second I need more discussion all those in favor all right thank you very much the net is all I have for this evening Mr chairman I'd like to make a motion to accept the minutes

America indivisible with liberty and justice for all so okay I'd like to open up the floor public comment uh watch the podium state your name in three minutes [Music] foreign I'm Kevin Bouchard um I'm addressing you tonight to share some concerns about the special Town council meeting other than the unknown um I didn't staple that together so that you could be split up other than the Unknown Subject matter for the executive session on the agenda I'm struggling to understand what is so important that it requires a special emergency meeting of the council firstly the budget's the budget it's been created with what appears to be zero input from the console I've seen no budget or spending level discussions involving counselors at their meetings this year in real terms unless there's something going on that I am completely unaware of passing the budget tonight versus June 21 is really basically the exact same thing with one notable exception and that's going to be the public perception and the question of why the council design decided to address the issue at a meeting that appears to be designed to exclude the public from the deliberations our citizens and taxpayers have been consistently ignored in the past why dump salt in the wound by voting on this budget tonight instead of June 21. secondly is the issue of the municipal property tax levy limit this town's Administration as well as the previous administration has been totally refusing to to address this issue in spite of repeated requests and they at least at the very least just do the calculations so we can know where we stand relative to this law I'm concerned that the vote being asked of you tonight will be an attempt to remove critical protections that are in place with the taxpayers to protect them from exorbitant tax levy increases you're apparently being asked to vote on something that should have been done last year by the previous Council as well as likely other years of the calculations have not been prepared I have some more observations and questions um you should feel free and I would encourage you don't blindly take what I have to say with my statements here tonight an accountant and or an attorney with a thorough understanding of Municipal budgeting and state laws that impact Municipal budgets should be consulted before you proceed to move on this issue if you look at the worksheet that's from the email that was sent to you by Dan yesterday I think line number one is what is stated as a tax levy limit for 2122 I'm not sure what the source of that number is based on budget expenses provided by the town office in the annual budget presentations at the end of my sheet there's a listing of the um increases in Municipal spending by fiscal year I get you can look at that for yourself unless a community has experienced massive changes in the total value of taxable property allowable increases in the tax levy limit are generally in the lower single digits everything on the worksheet builds from the number that's on line number one if it's faulty everything else that follows is faulty line seven is the calculation with the town numbers of what the maximum allowed increase would have been last year is 4.18 percent line 13 which I think is on the second page is the tax levy limit Allowed by law 3.8 million dollars 14 is the budget 5.4 million dollars that's an increase of 1.6 million dollars over the allowed amount according to the law 17 which I'm guessing is what you're being asked to vote on tonight states that the council voted to increase the limit permanently for current and future years to the best of my knowledge no such vote was ever taken furthermore Section 5 of the tax levy limit law and you I'm almost done and you've got a copy of that I saw in the email from Dan delineates the acceptable reasons for exceeding tax lady limits you should take the time to look at it I don't think we qualify at the end of the day last year's budget as well as possibly other budgets prior to this one was likely illegal is the Town Council being asked to make to ratify an illegal action taken by last year's Council foreign limit issue require consultation with non-eligible experts before you vote on thank you thank you anybody else don't be shy [Music] okay Mr Foster you got the floor full business approved in 23 24 budget um because you're aware I was contacted by the main Revenue Service due to the complaint I got this filed by a citizen from the town that we didn't follow the state statute ld1 and in my conversations um with the gentleman that I was speaking to his recommendation is that because what happened is something happened in the past in in from my perspective it just it it's it's ill relevant it's already gone it's already happened there's nothing we can do about it and my goal since I've been using September is to move forward not to keep beating and thrashing but all the mistakes that were made in the past in any event so I felt that we needed to have a special meeting to talk about this and And discussing it with the council it was felt that if we're going to be dealing with this we might as well deal with the budget at the same time and um and let's get forward moving forward so that the issue with the budget and and why we would do it now positional reason not to there's no reason not to do it now um we had we went through a process the budget advisory committee met three times they provided you at our main council meeting with a presentation that was well thought out and they unanimously voted to recommend the budget as presented we held two public comment periods with the exception of Kevin we had no negative comments about the budget people were supportive of the budget as percented this budget has been in the public eye four different times since the end of March it's been on two different Facebook pages it's been on our website everyone that I have talked to has been supportive of the process that we are using the direction that we were going and the budget that was being presented outside again outside of Kevin there has been nobody who has come to me and said that they are not satisfied with the work that is being done here now as far as I'm concerned there is absolutely no reason why we can't pass this budget now for what it represents so what does it represent when I assume this responsibility in September everybody is aware of all the issues so my goals which I share with the council was the council agreed with is that we were going to find a way to pay the unpaid short-term debt of 1 million two hundred and seventy five thousand dollars and this will be paid in full by February of 2024. so we will have taken care of that in 18 months that we are going to reduce our long-term debt and that we sold the ladder truck for four hundred thousand dollars and then a 400 000 debt and we got rid of the ambulance debt of 210 000. those were paid in full and um and that is a savings of 150 000 a year in um in payments which is not quite about three quarters of the mill and thanks to a very creative EMS director we still have two ambulances with no debt we needed to I was it was important for me that we need to develop sufficient cash flow to be able to fund this government because of the situation that we were in I was able to get a 300 000 line of credit which uh created incredible cash flow issues cash flow issues when they sell it was not um it was not anywhere near adequate for what we needed we've been able to accomplish this accomplish this by getting a new line of credit for the bank we've established our relationship with a bank of a million dollars and we shall uh appropriately fund this community and we were able to renew the old line of credit until February without having to incur the eight percent penalty that was written into the agreement and most importantly we've accomplished all this while maintaining reasonable services to our citizens in maintaining a function in government you're going to remember that during this time period we lost three department heads you know that was not that's not a simple or easy thing to deal with and we were able to bring in quality leadership and we're able to continue to provide the services with minimal disruption to our citizens and I personally want to thank Doug Mike Barden Lynn at the library for everything that they have done in stepping up into these positions and doing a great job so in order to make this all happen what my goal was was to reduce this this budget's years expenses by four hundred thousand dollars and have to reduce the new budget expenses by a million but what we actually did coming in with one quarter of the Year already expended we actually reduce expenses this year by 850 000 not 400 850 000. and this has allowed us to pay off seven hundred and seventy five thousand dollars of that short-term debt which it only leaves 500 000 left for this proposed budget and so something that I didn't think we're going to be able to do is that because of what the employees are able to do with this year's budget we're going to be able to reduce next year's budget the one that you're going to be voting on by two meals that was something I didn't think was possible and to do everything else so I don't know I don't know how you feel about all this but I can tell you something it feels like a damn wind to me I mean I spent seven to eight months of a lot of freaking work and not just for me but for everybody who is here and this is a win and we should feel good about it we should feel good about us being able to move forward in a positive way having a functioning government unlike some of the other communities who are dealing with similar situations we should feel good about it why don't I feel good about it honestly God it's just unbelievable so for me I've done everything that I said I was going to do there were people who told me that we couldn't do it and we did it then it culminates with you guys approving this budget tonight this community is moving forward thanks to the efforts of all these employees and I respectfully request that this account approved this budget if that's presented Mr chair and make a motion we approve 23-24 budget a second any discussions I would like to take a minute um and look at the business directly on where we transferred from the budget uh and so much work that's been put into it um a lot of hours uh there's there's been a lot of people give up a lot of time to devote especially with a budget advisory committee not only with the committee department heads employees of all the years I've served in our community on the council I can't say that I've ever seen so much time and effort go in to a budget as I've seen this year and and like I said from the department heads to the employees the budget advisory committee Our Town manager and counselors alike uh going over numbers and looking back of where it started and where we are and look at the accomplishment that we have come since our town manager has stepped in is is numbers that weren't even heard of of where and and I know the effort as a team as a town as our department has as our employees and as the citizens in our community brought this together it's it's it's it's it's it's a good feeling to know that we still have that support um along with it there's there's there's there's been some bumps in the road there's been obstacles uh I know that some of the people started out uh in the right direction went in different directions and I think that if maybe the amount of uh interest that some people put outside the budget committee and would have put it with it might have might have gained uh more knowledge I don't know but even with a lot of uh obstacles that we had to pursue along with this I feel from the recommendations from the budget advisory committee uh that I'm I'm very happy with the budget that we're with tonight and um I just wanted to let everybody know how much work and effort has been put into this this year thank you I also want to say something I'm new on the council however I observed and watched and participated in the budget advisory committee last year and I observed a lot of the process last year and I'm incredibly proud of work that this town has done I'm not on the council for my own good I'm on the council to make sure that the best things happen for this town and I think approving this budget as it stands is going to not only put us in good standing it's also going to move us forward and we need to move forward we have a town that's struggling right now we don't need to stay struggling we need to move forward and look for a vision for Fort Fairfield to get us back we're not ever going to be back to where we used to be back in the good old days but we can become more stable I own the only business in town with the exception of convenience stores and the grocery store that people can walk into that's sad we lost another business last weekend we don't have room to continue to lose businesses we need to look forward we need to be proud of our town proud of the work that's been done and there's a lot that happens in the budget process with the council and the town manager and department heads I mean we know what's going on we ask questions we observe we have conversations if we have questions I can talk to Dan I can talk to a department head I can ask questions and I do so when we sit here and vote on something we're not doing it blindly we're doing it with careful consideration and the best interest of the town I guess that's all I have to say well I'd just like to say I know a lot of work has gone into this budget and I know that Dan you have done you've done a good job and you've done what you said you were going to do I appreciate that and I appreciate the Departments and all their hard work I uh I'm somebody that likes to get a job done get it done now let's not let's not put your foot around let's get it done it's always laughing but I you know I want to move forward I want to move forward let's see the town grow this is a nice town we grew up in this town most of this year did and we've seen some big changes in this town not not for the best and I'd like to see more changes but I'd like to see a little better and uh so I mean we'd like to have all the bells and whistles but sometimes we can't you know we can only we can only have what we can afford that's all we can do we've got a big town it takes a lot of takes a lot of money to keep your town this size going and all everybody understands that or not but we've got a lot of roads in this town you know and they have to be maintained it's it's not easy with the amount of citizens you know the tax base that we have here it's a juggling act and it takes talent to uh to make that happen does it take sound you know thank you yeah I just might say thanks again to Dan He more than exceeded the expectations that was of him when he landed and uh thanks all the department heads for working diligently alongside Dan and US counselors yeah I need to make my job as a rookie counselor here quite quite well go quite well so ah so we get a we got a motion second go to vote all right and I've all right thank you do business let me tell you something this is not something I have any interesting topic about Instagram um so the municipal property tax living room has been around for a while I remember when I was here on my last stint uh we we did this it hasn't been done for a long time um when I received a call from the Revenue Service my question is what is it what what do you what are you expecting what do you want I mean you know it this is this is ancient history this was last year and he goes well the council should have voted on the on the tax levy limit because he says you know we're aware what's going on in Fort Fairfield we're not interested in making your life any more complicated but last year's Council should have voted on it I said well they didn't and he said well maybe this year the council could vote on it retroactively so you know whatever I mean honestly God it to me it just doesn't matter it is all ancient history it is it's not like people to go back and change anything we can't do that uh you know we created a budget of X number dollars and we recognized that budget was it created was was created in June when I came in we sat down with it I sat down with the Department is we understood that it was an issue and we spent 850 000 less that we didn't do it because of a miserable property tax living live it worksheet we did it because that's what needed to be done right yeah this is so this is so unnecessary this is a tramping back into the past to relitigate all the mistakes that were made and honest to God I am not the least that interested in doing that I don't want to talk about it tonight I don't want to talk about it on the 21st I hope I never have to talk about it again it is just so damn frustrating it's nothing that you folks did it's nothing that I did it's nothing that we can rectify we cannot fix it but what we do need to do is we need to be able to be in compliance with State Statute because if you get somebody like Kevin bushard sitting there complaining to the Maine State Revenue Service they're going to be looking for us to do something so the only thing that we can do is that we can retroactively approve exceed the limit uh increase the limit uh based upon the mistakes that were made in the past that does not mean that we're going to be spending more money in the future because we did this right it didn't matter that I mean there were all kinds of things we have all kinds of rules in place that work followed in the first place this is another rule that just simply was involved so let's just talk about it so we the the information where this comes from comes from the tax rate calculation for that that's where all these numbers come from and that's those are the numbers that are used to create the mill rate so that's the that's where this stuff comes from I completed the form I gave it to Tony he went through it he agreed with my numbers we believe that this is accurate so basically what this says is that when the town when the council voted last year in June to approve the budget they approved it was one million six hundred and fourteen thousand dollars 207 dollars over the levy limit now it doesn't mean that you can't spend that but based upon the statute what it says is is that you are required to do this form to make the community aware that that's what you did it doesn't mean you can't approve the budget doesn't mean you can't increase the mill rate seven meals because you have the legal authority to do that what this state law requires is that you tell everybody that's what you did it's another way of saying it so where does that one million six hundred thousand dollars come from let me count the ways so the first place the first number that this comes from is the fact that we did the tax rate calculation for in the prior year role you didn't do it right and we ended up we ended up uh adding in Revenue sharing twice right so what that did that was 730 000 so what that did is that reduced the uh the income that we're going to get from property taxes by 730 000. so consequently we spent 730 000 more than we were receiving now that's against the law as it relates to the Charter the charter says you cannot pass a budget where the expenses exceed the revenue well he did by 730 000. last year the fire department which had a huge budget overspent their budget by 109 484 dollars so apparently what they had wasn't enough so they just went over their budget by two hundred thousand dollars never talked to the council file manager never brought it up they just went over the budget by 200 so there's another two hundred thousand dollars of that 1.6 then they turn around and they budgeted 400 over 400 000 in income and guess how much they brought in 195 194 000 less so there's another two hundred thousand so there's four hundred thousand on top of the 730 and then despite all these things which the former Town manager knew pushed forward a budget that the council approved that was an initial six hundred eighty thousand dollars more than the year before so when you add all those numbers up you get one million eight hundred and three thousand dollars how did we get a negative one million six hundred thousand that's how we did it that's how it happened now you know you can go to all the lawyers in the world you can go to MMA and get all the legal advice that you want it's as simple as that it just simply they just overspent um underestimated income made mistakes yeah we're paying for it now and unfortunately it's not enough in June that they voted to they voted to uh uh to the budget with six hundred eighty thousand dollars and and and it was a legal vote and they turned around and they voted I mean September we voted to increase the mill rate by seven Mills that's what we had to do in order to balance the budget we're bringing that that whatever this whole thing is just doesn't change any of that that's what's happened that's in the past what we have to do to get Beyond this so that we can focus on the future is simply vote to uh increase the 2020 the 2022 Municipal property tax levy limit let the mean State Revenue Service know that we did it and friggin move on please so moved ah so Dance I'm a little bit confused here online 17. you've got to be seconded and then we can just well okay okay yes all right discussion uh so uh did the municipality vote to increase the limit permanent for the current and future years and somebody over here wrote the s in there so no that's not what that that's not what that means what that yes is is that it's saying is that the the vote that you're going to take is to increase the limit permanently that's the vote that you're going to take tonight that's the Vault that should have been taken raise the limit permanently one million six hundred and fourteen thousand dollars to address that tax bill what's that I'm sorry yeah for the chair to address that commitment I'm going to permanently exceed the limit that's only for one year at a time and one thing I would like to add in support of Dan he prepared this document because the state assessor's office said if he was provided assigned global with a record of the vote being taken then they would recognize it as a conduct of the legislative body his conduct the legislative body he can't reverse okay it's those for one year yeah located if we vote on it it's for last year you you are you are increasing Deliverance so just recognize that how we got into this place was by things being done that that were against uh the title Charter that shouldn't have been done so and this this was something that that should have technically have been done particularly because of the extent of the increase was it against state law also I think is it also against state law no well the vote is not against Saint law you can spend as much money as you don't want but the state law says Kevin is that you need to let people know right that you that you're spending this much little and this is just a format this form basically says is that that you should only be increasing your expenses uh by this growth factor it is it is supposedly the intent is to protect the community from a runaway governing body and but it doesn't mean that you cannot you cannot increase your inmate increase your expenses to whatever you want you just need to let the community know and this is just another way of letting the community know and the state says if you're going to do it you need to let the community know that you did it that's all it says it doesn't say that you can't do it completely says you just think about the community though and they didn't do that right so the state is saying now look you've got a citizen who's complaining he says so for can you just please you know take the vote so that we have it on the record that you did take the vote and acknowledge that this is what happened oh Christ we know what happened we've been dealing with them for eight months so motion second any other discussion okay go to vote hi Bob Pat hi hi vote I [Music] mean that is all the business other than uh hopefully a quick executive session Mr chair on my promotions I'm doing the executive session one I am method imrsa 4056 a personal matter okay Ocean second foreign [Laughter] thanks guys no thank all you guys yeah,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,9vpXsabCbAQ,"May 17, 2023 Public Hearing and Council Meeting",,61.0,3660.0,2023-05-17T23:38:48Z,none,154,0,0,0,thanks for coming to our second budget here in for uh fiscal year 23 and 24. uh um so tonight at our second budget hearing of the purchases today when he has any questions about the budget uh that you know they can ask me or department heads uh if they have any uh comments that they would like to share with Council your time to be doing it and to start off the budget hearing I would ask Jason Barnes if he would be willing to make his presentation uh from the budget advisory committee for their recommendations uh to this for this year's budget and you folks have PowerPoint have the information good evening before I get into the recommendations I just want to give you a background of a budget committee activities we received the proposed budget at the end of March and we've had a little time to review that our group attended the budget workshop at the Town Council the department heads on April 5th the next week April 12th we had our first meeting each member expressed their opinions of the proposed budget and asked the town manager many many questions we had some good discussions overall the group was receptive to the proposed budget and had several ideas that might be considered for later recommendations ah committee members attended the first budget hearing on May 3rd for the purpose of listening to town managers presentations and public comments and questions that are being asked well their second meeting on May 10th where we received updated numbers for the proposed budget and projected outcome for the current 22-23 year we discussed the Public's comments from the priors weeks hearing from various issues the group agreed to support the proposed budget and projected debt service plan we also prepared the following recommendations that are being provided to the council in writing you kind of group these like category one Being Human Resources you'd like to have Council and staff look at Employment Practices one of those items being benefits employee benefits programs see if how we compare to other communities the private sector you know we want to be fair to the employees but you know we don't want to overdo either you know are they in line uh I need to revisit those type of situations often uh concerned about employee retention monitoring performance of the employees encourage you know to be looking at part-time versus full-time as much as possible in all areas all departments Place replacement of a departing employees uh is a good time to be looking at you know make those decisions whether you want to go part-time or full-time and uh proposed uh doing a lot of cross-trading I know they have the town office and should do it in all areas so you know somebody leaves you're not vulnerable also related to Human Services resources Automation and Outsourcing there are times you know if we can we have uh needed some licensing if we could expand that maybe to cover some permits in the future and those type of things that may cut down on the hours in the office and you know we could still charge for some of those Services as well but save time pulse you know code enforcement is one at some point if we lost our code enforcement officer and you know it's be a hard job to find a replacement so you may have to either contract out you know look at other considerations uh also feel kind of strong if we should be looking for an economic development director slash grant writer we had one before and had a very good impact I think really help particularly the department heads that are struggling to come up with resources and funds you know on projective projects and we could have somebody uh help them with those things and grants be very helpful another categories Capital expenditures [Music] look at Vehicles which is in equipment which is one I know we have utilized the drmo program where we can get equipment vehicles from Department agencies we strongly encourage that as much as possible also would like to emphasize that any unused or unserviceable vehicles or equipment get rid of it don't need it around it's a it costs to have any asset and insurance and everything insurance is very high cost these days prioritize your vehicles by Department do in-house maintenance I know we do a lot of that that should be continued uh I know the public works is looking at the use of Ford 550 trucks for snow plowing we think that's probably a fine idea but you really got to keep track of everything and evaluate whether it's successful or not and you know that may be over a course of a few years buildings prioritize what needs to be done and look to the future of what's come you know buildings are going to need we're happy to see that the library roof hopefully be addressed in the future here that's an important asset to the town another comment brought to the committee was this room and the audio visual uh problems I know I watched the council meetings that by that way and have very difficult time hearing and and you know if there's a way we could improve that I think it would be good for the public Emergency Services Police Department and continue low-cost solutions for their motor vehicles uh you know perhaps the Dr ml program I know they've done some of that every once in a while you're gonna need a new Cruiser I think one's on the agenda perhaps this year the more you can use those programs I just save a lot continued use the part-time employees to help reduce it over time fire department along same thing continue to use your volunteers part-time employees as much as possible I don't know if there's any chance in the future that he could reduce the full time but you know we have to evaluate that on a routine basis uh we've got a prior tourism prioritize our equipment I I know there's a need for a pump truck that's again that's where you know grants is going to be needed and some people have to be creative to get that done Emergency Medical Services need to continue the monthly updates that Mike has provided uh and be open-minded to compare that cost to contracted services had a huge gap it's coming down and uh see how close we can get to substantiate keeping the program no and evaluate the cost benefit of operating Advanced life support in their services versus the basic life support all right lastly The Debt Service in Mill Way through the short-term Gap the tax anticipation note we feel strongly that that should be paid next year half should be paid by the end of this fiscal year with a balance in February we think it's in the best serious interest to get rid of that carryover debt as soon as possible long-term debt uh we have two outstanding loans one is nearing just a few years you'll have the community centers that should be paid is scheduled and same with the EMS loan that was when that was created that needs to be termed follow the schedule then the big focus is going to be on the council for balancing Reserve accounts we've got to focus on reestablishing our cash position to fund current reserves as much as we can it's an important issue for item replacement here in the future you got to balance that with mill rate reduction and continue through civil reductions as much as possible without sacrificing the critical Town services to conclude uh you know the group is looking at one team one fight the need for Need for goal congruence everyone must be willing to consider new options and evaluate their successes and failures in any changes in all Pursuits commitment to constant Improvement maintain our commitment to valuable time employees anybody has any questions no I just want to say that that has been very well put adjacent uh the amount of work and effort that's went into the budget committee has been has been a great resource to bring to the table and and I gotta I gotta tell you hats off that's a great introduction that you did to them he had a very good group yeah thank you all good points to read as a council need to be looking at okay thank you thank you yeah thanks Jason thank you thanks Jason the floors open uh anyone have any questions of the budget anybody has any comments that they would like to make to the council okay thank you no we're just talking about the budget right now anybody have anything they'd like to share 23 24 is per year 23 24 budget going okay uh looking for a motion to adjourn the budget okay okay all those in favor bye okay so now we're going to proceed on to our Media Town council meeting monthly meeting uh all the counselors are present I'd like to ask tell me to lead us a prayer [Music] we pray for our country at all times it's all sisters are safe healthy and happy we pray for wisdom for all those who guide and govern help this government body in every situation to know and to do the things that are right and just with soundness of judgment in making vital decisions we pray for the peacemakers that the Holy life-given Spirit ever dwell in their hearts and the barriers of fear suspicion and hatred may fall this we pray to the Holy Father amen amen amenities [Applause] for all thank you I'd like to open up the floor for a public comment period I am Martha Lee Taz also called Marty and I live at 45 Brunswick Avenue with my husband Bob we are here as residents of Brunswick Avenue and there's quite a few of us here Brunswick Avenue residence I will briefly speak and then of course everyone else who has a comment um welcome to come up um we are concerned about the speed of traffic on Brunswick Avenue especially during before and after school hours I see you've already added something to the agenda about that um we have no sidewalk on our street and um I think it's the most dangerous after school there are I think seven of us here are accounted including one boy who likes to ride his bicycle on the streets and um it's not safe I did not allow my grandchildren to walk to my house after school because they have to come on the field they cannot come by the street and it's too too dangerous especially in the winter with no banks and I've spoken with many other residents of the street I think I counted between 15 and 20. they couldn't be here tonight all of them but they are every single one that I spoke to said oh my goodness oh yes it's crazy so anybody else with waffles and did you have you had an interesting perspective yeah um Fly party we have my husband have concerned about the speed limit on the street it's listed as 15 miles an hour from the time we travel forward to come on Brunswick Avenue all the way up the street all the time nobody including me um really um follows that because 15 miles an hour when there are no children this weekend it just doesn't seem reasonable I think we're looking for something that's reasonable um in most school districts will see perhaps a flashing yellow light when school is as students are approaching school to alert people that it's a good female in our Zone after those hours it's not necessary 25 mile an hour residentiality would probably be appropriate but as it is now 25 miles an hour is is not being concerned so um foreign thank you Tony serious thank you yeah anybody else okay good floored in thank you and I didn't mean to sell sarcastic for me I'm serious um thank you for your for doing your job um licensing permits we do have one uh that we have an application for catering permit from northern Maine Brewing Company and the recommendations the council approved and signed the catering permit uh unfortunately acceptable second it's all those a favor hi great thank you very much um financial report we are it is hard for an edge that I am here is the same we are closing in with you here um we've got less than six weeks and uh this would be uh this year will be in the books um it's not a lot to report uh that is different than what we've had in the past the trend has been expenses are going down I have a little concern about some of these pictures coming in which I addressed in the middle that we receive the only uh the only issue that the only concern that I would bring up that I didn't bring up in the memo is our accounts receivable on property taxes for this year it's still hard it's about seven hundred thousand and it would normally be lower than that this time of year so it's not a question of income and expenses it's just a question of the bill getting paid so that we have a passion that they come uh June 30th so we could pay the 500 000 so I can I can assure you that we will be doing that I just wish that our after single role on property taxes uh so we'll see how it goes we still have six weeks um I did talk to the bank a little bit about that concern their comment was 8 500 000 130 the United States yes we will so that was the extent of that so outside of that um I mean I think things are going well the Departments are doing great with their expenses and I think that we're going to show a very good Surplus coming in this year so that is that is a very good thing um I don't know how many how many years did you served on the board-based Solutions pretty much thank you 19 years and you probably have missed two meetings yeah anyway one of those meetings is this last one so uh only because if he was under the knife uh so uh I was at the meeting uh the week went over the uh the budgets which are all fine it's pretty Steady Eddy business uh so there's really no issues there in the monthly financial report uh but we did have an update on the construction of cells five and six which they are still looking at moving forward sometimes it's construction season there is some concern about increase in cost but that is something that we'll know better as time goes on um the only thing that really came up if you spent some time on is that every year there is an organization in Southern Maine that puts forward a bill this year was LD 1171 and the purpose of the bill is to promote Recycling and reducing waste and what they ultimately want to do is get rid of blazers and so if the bill passes what happens is is that every ton that goes into a landfill is assessed a fee that the people who use the landfill have to pay and it is not a is not a practical thing for Rural meaning to think that you that uh that not using landfills is going to work because it's just not uh there were um I think he said there were 21 individuals who testified five testified in support 13 testified in opposition including dep was in opposition to this bill so what happened was is that they didn't uh move to that ought not to pass what they decide was the table until next year and so Mark's comment to us was that he's tired of being on the defensive every year there's a bill that comes up that they want to assess a fee to citizens who have to utilize a landfill in order to get rid of their garbage and he's tired of it and he wants so he is thinking looking at getting together with leadership at the legislature to put in a bill saying that that landfills cannot be treated that cannot be charged fees in that manner so he wants to go on the offense he started you know the defense he knows that there's going to be another bill like this that then he has to go down he has to testify he has to deal with it so anyway we spent a fair amount of time talking about that but all in all is a that's a well-oiled machine a business runs very well they do a great service uh they're very professional about it and you know we're in good hands up here in the county anybody have any questions on that uh we had a busy police chief coming good evening everybody I um Dan asked me to speak a couple weeks ago at the council meeting and um I'll I'll talk about some of the issues that we have been dealing with since the last time I I spoke with you and some of the issues are kind of the same are mostly the same so it's been a very busy 2023 for us um here today we've logged 1550 incidents and we were just over 2500 last year all year we've referred 70 cases to prosecution uh so far this year with offenses ranging from sex assaults involving children domestic violence burglaries thefts traffic law issues officers have been proactive with traffic enforcement and property checks in between calls for service when time allows we try to get into the school zones as often as we can on patrol as in between calls as well we've been getting hit with burglaries lately as storage units within our community we've been successful in solving these cases we've arrested two people for burglary and theft and have an outstanding warrant for a third person for burglary during this case three search warrants were written and granted and a search warrant were served by Fort Fairfield officers at a residence in Presque Isle where thousands of dollars worth of stolen twos were Fort Fairfield were recovered and returned back to Fort Fairfield we hope that being proactive with these cases and solving these crimes uh will deter people from coming here to do things like this we're currently hosting a law enforcement pre-service phase two course which is a prerequisite course for somebody to be a part-time law enforcement officer in the state my hope is to hire additional part-time officers to continue to fill open shifts caused by officers on vacation secret under training this is a big cost savings to the town and these dedicated part-time officers have filled almost every vacant shift with the exception of a few this fiscal year they've been very help they're also very helpful during potato Blossom Festival some proactive training that we're doing Sergeant Cormier recently completed an active shooter instructor program at the Sig Sauer academy one thing we take very seriously is is school safety and the potential for an active shooter and being prepared for it we have the attitude that you know we're not immune from this type of thing and we need to be ready for it our plan is to continue to train our office to be prepared for that type of incident on the program starts from the initial call with one officer working responding to confront the threat to EMS response to handle match casualties and to post-threat containment issues and we will always be prepared for these types of issues God forbid they happen in our community uh the used Cruiser that we purchased in March has been put into service um that cruiser with around 50 000 miles was purchased solely with funds used by selling Surplus equipment we're able to use uh police equipment we had to equip uh to equip it along with equipment I was able to obtain from State Surplus that Cruiser replaced one with 168 000 miles which we sold we have one officer slated to attend the 18-week police academy in August this will finally complete the full-time certification requirement for all of our officers uh the one uh the other full-time officers have agreed to schedule modifications um to offset overtime costs while the officer is away the contract dictates what the officers will work for a schedule but they've all agreed to to help out and just do something different to offset costs while we're well he's away um he'll graduate from the program in December I'd like to publicly thank all my officers for their continued dedication hard work and professionalism so now for the Bison in the room I guess so to speak [Music] this has been an issue that has consumed um countless man hours over the last several months so we have an ongoing situation with a very haphazard farming operation in Fort Fairfield that has an adequate structures needed to properly contain bison uh Dan and I uh were able to uh put a zoom meeting together with commissioner Beale from the Department of Agriculture and commissioner sauce Chuck from the Department of Public Safety uh yesterday afternoon there's no state agency that is regulating this type of farming operation or willing or able to assume assume responsibility for the actions of the farmer through the department of inland fisheries and wildlife have those Department of Inland fishery have some basic regulations regarding the possession of Wildlife and captivity they consider bison a domesticated breed such as cattle I disagree they do not license these Farms or inspect them to ensure safe appropriate facilities bison are considered dangerous unpredictable have a large flight zone making them hard to Corral or herd and extremely sensitive distress because of their physical size and horns this makes them significant danger to property other animals and humans the state's position as if the situation is deemed a public safety issue it is a responsibility of the appropriate law enforcement agency in the area to resolve the problem in this case it would fall in the fort Fairfield Police Department it was not equipped trained equipped or have the staff if we assume responsibility to bring in those who are properly chained like Agents from the USDA we would then be responsible for paying the cost of their services which is in the thousands of dollars I believe that we need clarification from inland fisheries and wildlife and USDA regarding any responsibility they might have on regulating these farming practices I plan on reaching out to MMA to see what guidance they can provide on the issue I'm also working with representative Babin to try to enact legislation to protect our community from future issues I feel it would be appropriate for myself and Diane to reach out to State agencies other law enforcement agencies in any applicable associations that support raising bison to prepare an ordinance outlining these requirements for having such a farm raising these animals in our community it is my intent to see what other ordinances that may be available we could use this will protect our citizens ensure appropriate standards for the well-being of the animals and limit our exposure under to undo liability claims like the council's support to start this process I I think it's something that we need to do immediately does anybody have any questions regarding any of the issues that I brought up tonight man I think those Bisons were put down yesterday not all of them not all of them I um we need to do something I know that we had a gentleman here just a few years ago that moved up here from Massachusetts that was that had signed agreements from Whole Foods I think Walmart and a few others to buy all the Bison he could raise he wanted to raise bison in Fort Fairfield he gave a good presentation but one of the things one of the questions that came up was how are you going to contain them and he said that uh the right way to contain bison was to put up a double fence and the fence on the outside had to be strong enough to withstand a 30 mile an hour impact from a vehicle he's smart yeah I I like what you're doing and I feel at this point we we as a community and outside communities has been very lucky that there hasn't been um someone or an incident but we're on borrowed time with that and you know the thought of these bison out at night in a car full of teenage kids coming upon them in the middle of the night on one of our rural roads makes me sick to my stomach yeah and when I think it would I do the same to everyone here I like what you're doing and I support it as soon as you put something together well Dan and I will work together and we'll we'll get we'll get something done thank you thank you thank you have a good night um just quickly on the budget um so I was I have I have um posted this budget since the end of March three times on two Facebook pages and on our website and I was talking with a citizen yesterday or a couple days ago who I would assume is someone that I would assume would be well informed in his commentary was so Dean please tell me that that the that the no rate's not going up and I'm thinking how do we get the word up is David here today what there he is okay if there's some ways that you can get this in the paper the mill rate is going down okay I mean that could be the headlines the build rate is going down now I don't know how much but I assure you it's going down I've been saying this since March and I was shocked that this whole this person's Hope was that if it just stayed the same he'd be happy just as long as it doesn't go up so you know you know we I think we've done a really great job at dealing with the issues that we've had to deal with um we're moving in a positive direction we are going to get this low rate down to an appropriate level uh and um when you folks pass the budget next month what you're doing is you're setting the budget for next year but you're not setting the mill rate the budget that you're approving shows a mill rate a mill rate reduction of three quarters of a meal but it's also showing a surplus of 218 000 percent I do not Envision that Surplus changing much one way or the others so in September you're going to have you will be making a decision as to what you're going to do with that 218 000 we don't need an overlay of 218 000. so we can use some of that money towards to help it up on our cash reserves but there's also a fair amount that can be used to further lower the mill rate further lower the military thank you thank you for being here so anyway um I I just want to I just I just want to say that I want I really want to thank the budget advisory committee I think they really you know they they were attentive they asked good questions uh I think that is clear with the presentation that they're taking it serious I think that this year was a big Improvement they were what they were able to do last year and I think that next year is going to be a bigger improvement over what they're going to be what they did this year um one of the things as you are aware I have sent them uh the April financials along with my memo and so when the May finish was about you guys or who wrote the budget advisory committee as well so they will see every month where we are in the budget and what the manager is looking at and is concerned about so that when the time comes and then the start time of next year's budget they're not going to feel like they're just stepping in a cold they're going to have ongoing information and I think that that is going to help them be better prepared to ask good questions and to work through the process with the council so um does anybody have any questions anything at all about the budget thank you thank you Dan um the fort Fairfield Community empowerment project you received Catherine's summary notes I am meet with her tomorrow morning um we're going to go over that the general consensus of the group was that we have one more meeting to finalize uh the uh the recommendations that were made so I'm assuming that Catherine will be getting in touch with you within that we'll be doing this sometime in the next two weeks once we've had that meeting there will be a um there will be a final set of recommendations that then will go to the community and so we will get those dispersed uh so the community gets a chance to see them review them and have an opportunity to comment or make recommendations or ask questions uh and then uh I I don't know if it will be the June council meeting but if it's not the June then it would be the July but I'm thinking that maybe at the general council meeting we will have recommendations from this work to the council that will set some new systems in place uh moving forward so I thought that the meeting went well with Catherine uh I thought it was productive there was great participation we had a good turnout which was really good people are taking it serious which is really important um and this will really set the stage for us to start the process for a job search for the town manager anybody have any questions on that thank you I I gotta say that um I don't think that people pay much attention to the Fort Fairfield Utilities District but it's an important it serves an important function to the people who live in this community and I'd say John halstrom is doing an outstanding job he has been responsible for uh this multi-million dollar project that they're working on right now uh he's received a lot of federal funds and support to be able to do that he saw an opportunity to be able to apply for some federal funds to upgrade the infrastructure to our pumping stations one of them is the one that uh that we he's asked for the council to deed some property so that they have space to be able to do the work that they need to do and as you saw we just got a letter from Senator Collins saying that one million 592 thousand dollars is being set aside in the infrastructure budget for next year for John's project so uh he has he has a great way of finding these things and he has an even better way of sharing information in a way that causes him to win these great words John has really done a good job uh for the Utilities District so my hat's off to him told him this and uh I just wanted to make a counsel in the community aware what a great job that he's doing for the town in the Utilities District that's kind of an interesting thing happened with this um they they I had I had told you at the last council meeting that that they had to they had an improvised with the nose of extension to consider the development the development period they had kind of in the contract they had the right to do that well the next day I received it in the mail federal express uh that requesting the extension well last week I received an email from the director of development asking for the town to sign a stockhold agreement for financing this it's a it's a normal thing that anytime that uh somebody is getting financing and there are and they're using infrastructure uh as collateral uh that is on land that they're leasing that the financing institution is going to go to the landlord the owner who should be us and say you really do have this agreement with them and it is as we understand it is that there is no litigation they have these points that they make up that they point out and they want us to sign something a document saying yes this is all true well that's what this is okay so um and I'm going to ask down and remove business uh for you folks to authorize me to sign that and get it backward because he wants it but what I wanted to know is when we're getting paid and that wasn't really clear to me so I figured before we sign this installment agreement maybe we could get some clarity one we might actually see someone so it took a little while and yes when does when does the lease uh take effect when do they start paying is it at the end of the project at the start of the project no no um they have we the the lease is divided up into three turns the first one is the development term which is two years the two years were up April 20th this year so if if they're not on the grid they have the right to extend that another two years there's no payment made during the developmental term when payment once you start sending electricity across the grid that's one of the leases inactive so it's a 20-year lease from that point every January we get an annual payment of 21 000 something but uh they're going to be I want to know when they're going to be going on grid you know somebody finally told me that they're playing I've been on the grid in mid-june so my question was then I'm assuming that we're going to receive a program at a payment for 2023 once you go on the grid for the rest of the year and it took me a while to get an answer of them but yes you're right you are and you will so I don't know if we're going to get it for June 30th I'm not holding my breath on that I know that her son has had the lines run if they're not connected yet but it's not much to get them connected and Darren and I are keeping an eye on it when they do so my understanding is that we will receive a pro rat of payment once they're on the grid and they're translating which should be by mid-june um and then come then we will receive a full payment uh in by January 15th for 2024. so that was that worked out quite good because I really didn't know much about it I've seen the agreement I've read it uh it's always nice just to hear it directly from the company yeah um so anyway so that's where we are with that um a rooster county has decided that they want to go to the fiscal year um and so and to do that what they're going to end up doing is they're going to send us um sometime this fall they're going to send us a bill for six months which is going to run from January 1st to 2024 to June 30th and then they're also going to be sending us a bill uh for the next 12 months which is going to be if both bills are going to come due in October of 2024. so if the um I don't I I mean we don't know what six months bill is I haven't seen it yet um but what they are telling communities that they do have the option to be able to pay the six month bill then three equal yearly paying this without any interest or you can just pay it that will be part of a budget the next budget that you're working on for the next town manager and uh so that person will be sorting that all out I'm sure they'll have great wisdom to impart on the council it's the best way to handle that uh but I just want to let you know that in uh we're gonna be paying 18 months worth of bills in one year uh but I'll be at Blue Birches wish you all the best anybody have any questions on that how much what's the bill going to be how much is it going to be um it's a good question our bill this year is almost 300 000. so I don't think that the six month is not going to be 150 000 it'll be I think they're going to be they're going to try to do a Bare Bones thing uh but so I'm I'm guessing at least I'm sure it'll be somewhere between 100 to 120 000 somewhere in the air from Top up so instead of 300 000 will be 420. something like that 400. don't hold me to it but I just yeah that's just an educated guess uh I just would publicly uh just like to congratulate uh the board of directors uh at the at the school system uh they've just hired a new superintendent Tim hasn't even left yet uh Tony at Staples who is the principal there and I've heard nothing I I've not been telling you personally but I've heard nothing but great things about her and that she's going to be stepping in as Tim leaves and and she is not an intro she's a permanent so I say good for sad20 um you know they've done they've done a great job they've certainly done a great job on their budget they really have a we've been very very fortunate the town has so anyway I just want to point that out and just congratulate Johnny and look forward to meeting you sometime no speed limit size on Brunswick Avenue so this is not this is not actually a new territory for me because I think that school started in 1991. and Brunswick was a sleepy little Street until that school opened up so the access to uh dropping your kids off or picking them up is on Brunswick Avenue and it's not a short Street and we dealt with this another manager between 98 and uh 2013. we spent a fair amount of time talking about putting in a sidewalk and it was a combination of cost people giving up Lawns having teared up trees cutting out trees there's a bunch of issues that just seem to preclude that from ever happening I know there was talk about speed bumps and that was something that was really not Public Safety and I don't think that's a good idea uh for fire trucks ambulances and police cars and you basically need to get somewhere in curry but I do think that it's a legitimate concern and it is um I I my sense is that um most people I mean we're all busy and we're just not paying attention it's more about that rather than people just saying I don't care what speed limit is I don't think people are doing there might be some but I don't think that's the issue the issue is people just start thinking about it so I asked Matt to look at uh in in the police department can only do so much uh because there's one person on that tone uh and and so they try to do it but honestly if you see a police car parked on president cabinet guess what degree slow dance so you know okay anyhow um I do think that so serious consideration should be given to posting the street with a flashing Sun so that when somebody turns on to Brunswick the light is flashing 15 miles an hour uh and uh and it's just like oh yeah right I need to slow down school district and um so I mean I think that that would help I don't think it's going to be perfect and so I can solve all the problems I think it is something that is doable with the resources that we have uh we're talking about Seventeen hundred dollars uh Mike Greenlaw has agreed to put the sign up for us if you get one uh you know charges um and I think that if if at all possible it would be great that that side particularly was blinking when kids are going in when kids are coming up because I do agree that in the summertime 25 miles an hour is perfectly appropriate I don't think that the chief is looking to catch anybody uh doing 25 miles an hour in a 15 mile an hour school zone that school is out so you know a little um typically when you see those signs it's usually when the students are present outside the signs are usually flashing right so I have um let's see so if the council was if the council was uh on the mind we could we could see this is where the reserve account comes in handy you know having cash and Reserve account for help um I'm thinking we could probably find a way to make this work uh if the council was was so moved I would uh and they made a motion to purchase the sign then I would take it out of our administrative reserves we have a fair amount of money there uh I I look for sure I understand why we have as much as we do um but I just didn't see some of that reallocated uh particularly the police department who's been kind of shortchanged in the reserve accounts over the last three or four years um anyhow um if the council would like I can move that to my business uh for you to take care yeah you guys okay with that yeah thank you this will give you the time you'd like a motion to make better artists you know we'll do that thank you uh and the only other thing is uh later house or in uh a community group is yeah and they're getting it cleaned up files are being separated and I was being blood draws yeah so hopefully Garen that's going to be uh hoping the hall eight or ten loads out there once it's sorted this week along so hopefully within two or three weeks we'll see you later good any plans to take the concrete out as well no no the plan was just to get it down okay so that is the correspondence and reports meaning if you go to Old business okay uh we held uh at uh at our public hearing on the four ordinances that you see in front of you um we had the minutes uh there was um uh Tony and I in Gary sirway and Nidra who attended uh public hearing uh there was uh nothing adverse that came up on any of these ordinance so I will take them one at a time I would ask the council to make a motion through food court 2302 to convey land to join Christine hey all in favor aye thank you I would ask the council to approve ordinance 2303 chicken Bay land Gary sirway Jr and let me see full moon all in favor uh I would ask Council to approve ordinance 2304 to deep land through the port Fairview utility system it's all there all right thank you and I would ask to approve ordinances 2305 to Conde a right away in Riverside Park and worked here for utilities the whole business new business um so we have here the bank has been interesting prices so um to approve the lines credit card and Trust uh which uh will uh come uh July we will renew the line of credit we'll leave another five hundred thousand dollars we paid off uh in February and the motion is such a really good excuse me like this so somebody is going to move at the katana Fort Fairfield borrow from the Italian Trust Company alone of five hundred thousand dollars for eight months and fixed interest rate of eight and a quarter percent for the purpose of renewing a current line of credit used for working capital also the motion authorizes second chairman and Dan Foster the town manager permission to sign any required Darkness on behalf of the test foreign Foster Town manager permission to sign any required documents I'll be happy to tell them all in favor discussion call besides the high interest rates yeah I know the sooner we can pay it off thank you very much that has been an interesting process so appointments in the northern Maine development commission board of directors I have to see all you guys jumping right I got lots of fun so what I would say since nobody seems to be is anybody here interested in doing this yeah okay uh so I am I am willing to to step in until we get a new manager I don't have a problem doing that so I would if if you folks are in agreement that would be some make a motion to approve can foster Town manager Kevin Bouchard to be to represent the child enforce repair if you don't have any novel permissions order directors exactly it's all in favor aye aye thank you and um I need a I need a counselor to introduce ordinance 2306 which would be for the town of Fort Fairfield to enter into a lease agreement with Jacqueline and Tim Shaw doing business as Little Sunshine Learning Center at the final dog facility Mr chair I make emotions don't need a motion I just need someone to introduce look at the floor thank you and that's uh and I also would like to have someone introduce an ordinance 23.7 to repeal ordinance 1708 which will give us retail marijuana establishments I will entertain that promotion 2307 um right okay so what we will be doing is we will be scheduling a public hearing for both of these and then we'll be coming back to the council at the June council meeting and uh and you will have um the uh England who came to speak either on behalf or against the ordinance and then assume you can make a decision as to whether or not you want to pass these words okay yeah if anybody has any questions they know where they can find you um if we need to we have a vacancy on the planning board uh and uh we were asking for the council to appoint uh John charnier uh to replace that uh replace uh Ken stratton's uh position to serve out his remaining turn and John is currently an alternate member of planning board to move I second that all in favor aye aye um and you folks have seen the estoppel certificate I did um I did email it to Rick uh Courier he did get back to me and said that you know as I suspected it's it's a normal document sees no problem with it and so I would ask the council to authorize the town manager to execute this document on behalf of the town and get it back to these folks so second levels in favor aye feel last but certainly not least I would ask the council to consider purchasing a sign that we could put up on Brunswick Avenue to hopefully slow down traffic all those in favor aye aye no discussion we're all good um one question yes do those signs come with a camera would a camera be useful they do not come with the camera is there an issue around the camera is that something that is yeah I was curious about cameras because I know that other towns use cameras yeah um to Monitor and I mean certainly that might be a good that's not a bad idea I don't know maybe more than one I will I will check on that and give you a reward let me know what the deal is okay but that is a good point yeah could uh could Chief like just park a spare Cruiser up on the side of the street dude no we sold them yeah so hopefully hopefully this will help the first time folks that is the agenda for tonight yeah sure well wait a minute April 19th okay yeah uh accept the minute on April 19th motion okay polls a favor all right I read mine okay I need a motion to accept warrants number 22 and number 23. that's awesome second all right all in favor aye um [Music] perfect [Music] [Laughter] oh yeah hopefully it helped me deterred the Speeders yeah yeah I mean no question but yeah yeah a car is pretty expensive to set there maybe just the light on the pole yeah yeah,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,YfjKT37etG0,"May 3, 2023 First Budget Public Hearing",,63.0,3805.0,2023-05-04T23:43:48Z,none,148,0,0,0,hey everybody for coming out here tonight for the first budget here the 23-24 budget uh Dave will be making a brief presentation of the budget the budget process you'll have an opportunity to ask Dan the department heads any questions you may have regards the budget and to share any concerns you have regarding the budget council is here to listen and take your concerns under consideration prior to approving the budget at our July at our June council meeting we would ask that those who would like to address the council to use the microphone at podium and keep your remarks to no longer than 15 minutes and while while I'm here let's let's give our interim Town manager a big round of applause for savings thank you there you bet the mic now big guy well that's a great way to start and you know I also just wanted to say a really big thank you to the BFW for letting us being able to utilize this space it certainly is a big improvement over the gym and also to Mr Whitaker making sure that we can be heard in helping us get the chance to set it up to get the facility set up so I've been uh I've really been pondering for the last couple of weeks about exactly what I'm going to talk about tonight in this presentation and quite frankly you know it's starting to feel like a broken record I mean you I've been doing this for eight months and every time we have a meeting we seem to be going over the same stuff so what I thought I would do is I would put most of it in a memo which you guys have and you can read it instead of listening to me Sega so that's going to be Improvement and I'm sure the council will appreciate that because they heard it more than anybody else I think it's pretty safe to say that this is not a typical year we've had we've had a pretty uh we've had a tough couple of years um and this is certainly this year the budget that we're in right now in the single walk can you guys hear me no no if you could uh handle a bike over there yeah the green light's on big guy configuration I'll try on the mic that clicked up too quick so how's that yeah no thank you in here yeah [Music] thanks all right [Music] anyway this is a great start so as I was saying this is really not a typical year [Music] thank you guys what I would say is that this is not a typical year most everybody could agree with that and it is certainly not it's certainly not a typical budget and I have not assumed the role or the responsibilities of the typical Town management my role has been very different I am here for a defined period of time to complete a specific task what I've agreed to do is and what I and I along with the town managers are the along with the town department heads is that we're here to fix decisions the financial situation that we find ourselves in we need to retire the unsecured debt we're doing 775 000 of that this fiscal year we're going to do 500 000 of that by January of next year we need to remedy our cash flow emissions we've been negotiating with guitar and Trust they've agreed to renew the line of credit half the light of credit next year without any uh any penalties and they've agreed to give us a million dollar line of credit for next year so that we can actually pay our bills from July until January and you will not be here in Fort Fairfield can't pay their County property tax to the Bangor Daily News it was important that whatever we did and however we chose to cut to preserve cash was that we maintained a functioning government and that was very important to me providing services to our residents and last but not least to bring down our mill rate to a reasonable rate so I mean I think most of us could agree that reasonable and so I'm going to tell you what my understanding of what that what that means you guys are hearing me okay right yeah yeah okay thank you yeah you're making me nervous too you are outside these are great for singing thank you so reasonable we are providing services to the citizens of Fort Fairview there are other communities in our area that are providing similar services that we provide so what I would look at is those communities who are providing similar services that we provide what are they charging their citizens to me it seems like it is a reasonable way to determine what would be an appropriate cost for what we're doing and so we were looking at if you look at poulton or Kent Presque Isle Caribou we all pretty much provide the same type of services so Holton is at 22.6 mils Fort Kent is almost at 22. Caribou are closing in on 24. so I have always felt that if we want to continue to provide the services that we're providing if we can be somewhere between 22 and 23 Mills then that is a reasonable expectation if we were seriously as a community want to see us providing paying less then we need to look at which Services we feel that we can do without in order to do that and that is a process of that communities go through all the time but for this year our goal is to take care of the issues that have happened in the past two years and if we do that as as I have outlined next year we will be able to have a mill rate between 22 and 23 meals and I'm feeling like that I have done my job I have always felt and one of my major concerns has been is that we need we need a town manager to run this town to manage it to lead it not set the direction but to lead in order to do that we need to have an environment that will be attractive to someone who has the potential in the ability to do this in in a very tight labor market I've always felt that we need to have in order to do that a strong management team we need to have a community that is committed and we need to have a physically strong business plan and my hope and plan is that that's what I have been able to set in place so it is it's why I'm here doing what I'm doing is the budget perfect ly nothing is ever going to be perfect but it's the job that I was asked to do it is a job that I intended to do and I honestly feel it's a job that we've done and so I my heart goes out I'm so thankful to all the employees who have put up with my assessment demands and um it have really helped step forward to put us in this financial position so what I'm going to do is I'm not going to go over all the numbers on the budget but what I want to do is I just like a few things in each department and you had your I would look at your expenses and at the top of your expenses as Administration so I would ask that you look at that so in administration one of the things that I would point out as we are looking to see where we can save money is that for whatever reason the former Town manager decided that even though the salary line was 394 000 she she put in the budget 370 000. so we're actually twenty four thousand dollars behind getting started and that's the reason um well you do not see it and you're Consolidated but we are going to be about twenty thousand dollars over in that line item Administration and and I would say that that is a one one part of this department where where we are on we have one position to win what's going on in administration right now is that we are in a period of transition so our treasurer tax collector Ella Lakeland who's been doing this job since 2000. it does a great job it's starting to transition up so next year starting with July 1 she is going to 20 hours a week and we have two employees who are working there now who are assuming her responsibilities so Chrissy Emery will be the HR and Treasurer and Shannon Saint Pierre will be our tax collector so when Ella transitions out we are not putting a new person in and so that will help bring that line down and that is reflected in the in the total cost of next year's budget the library there's any Department that took a hit this year it's been the library it's the only Department that whose budget is actually drawn below what it was two years ago we have two part-time ladies who work 24 hours a week the library is open three days a week Thursday Friday and Saturday we have a very active Board of Trustees we have new volunteers who are coming in and providing programs to the library um and uh Barbara just applied for and received a ten thousand dollar Grant to help create a gathering space for retirees so the library is only open three days a week but they're very active they're very committed and they're doing a great job in the police department it's uh when uh becomings started in August of 2021 he was a department of one we now have four full-time officers and uh in in Matt is a working chief it is a very competitive Mark we 've seen uh where areas where people have had communities that have had police departments where they've actually had to close them down because they simply would not be as officers they are it is it's an expensive profession right now and Matt has done a great job in putting together a full-time force that gives us basically 24 7 coverage plus he is now got six part-time folks who are qualified and can help fill in to help alleviate and head down on overtime so that department has been Matt has been doing a great job in that department the fire department has has been the has been a really focal point for how our budget has gone awry and I can tell you that on September 19th was my first day as interim Town manager and that night at six o'clock I was at Mike and Peggy's house September 20th at six o'clock I was at he's his in Vegas house Michael we need to come back to the fire department and he agreed to do that and it was one of the best things that we've had happen for our town in a while to have Michael come back when Michael started in October we had two volunteer firefighters now we have over 20. we had two SUVs and two four-wheel drive pickups we had a ladder truck had 120 foot Bull we got two brand new ambulances and we had over 350 000 with the debt that we were paying every year we now are down to one pickup we have one new ambulance and one used ambulance and we no longer have a ladder truck angle and then that has been paid that has been a big plus you'll notice in the budget that the fire department and ens have been separated out there's been a lot of discussion about the town whether or not we should have the annual service in Fort Fairfield or whether or not we should contract with another Community like Prescott so the bottom line is is that whatever we do with EMS there's still going to need to be a fire department so when you look at the budget for the fire for the for the EMS you're looking at about 722 thousand dollars in operating costs you look at the income that we're projecting which is 360 000 and the cost if we were to utilize the service for prescal of 250 000 what that means is that our actual costs they have have the endless service in Fort Fairfield is 112 000. that's the number to be thinking about when you think is this something that we want it's not the 722 000 it's the 112. and that's assuming that we are not utilizing the second amulets more for uh transfers which is something that might be starting to do he has been able to get a bullet call and part-time folks to be able to help operate that so we're not utilizing uh full-time people for overtime we can minimize the number of overtime number of full-time people that we need to have and uh Mike knows he's going to hear and so we'll all be looking at this next year to see how we do with the with the animals we've come a long ways from where we work in public works it's been a challenge we're all competing for the same amount of employees the CDLs and it has been really hard Darren has spent most of this winter with not a full supplement of employees right now he is down to eight say he's up to eight he's been down more than that one of the things that Darren has been looking at we recently purchased a Ford F-550 that does not require a CDL we've been using one tons for more plowing in town and parking lots and things like that along with the along with the greater worry dear you know hello thank you along with the loader and so the hope is is that we can get more part-time folks to help with allowing particularly when we have the wind storms that we have to keep the roads open we can utilize the 550s we've been we're going to save on save on money we're going to save on overtime with our full-time employees [Music] it's a way to get around this issue with having to have CDLs we had a Paving bond that was paid this year so in this budget we've added a hundred thousand dollars for Paving which is really a drop in the bucket but it's more than what Darren has had in in the recent past years uh Parks and Rec uh that's another department that that we have that is taking a draw we have Doug has decided that rather than replacing Uh Kevin with another full-time employee that what he would like to be able to do is get a full-time part-time person who is certified to run the pool which will then allow Doug to manage the department right now Doug is the certified person for the swimming pool and during the summertime that takes an awful lot of time but we've been able to reduce the overall cost of the department because of this he has been able to get he's reached out he said a number of parents would be willing to volunteer and to help help step up and with supervising summer programs and he's working to find lifeguards for the pool and so that is that is what's going on with him if you look at the miscellaneous expenses uh it's all pretty self-explanatory we are going out to bid on our insurances um the I I will say that the school has been doing an excellent job at uh the request for the tab we are still what they are asking for the tenant is still less than what it was back in 2021. so I my hats off to the school board and to Tim doake and I'm sorry to see him leave the bottom line is that we're looking at in this budget year we're looking at saving over eight hundred thousand dollars around eight hundred thousand dollars you're looking at paying off 1.1 billion dollars worth of debt and we're still showing a small Surplus so far we still have being in June to get through next year's budget closely been able to pay off as much of that loan that we were in this fiscal year we were showing a three three-quarters percent drop in the mill rate three quarters percent of a mill we're also showing a little over two hundred thousand dollars in Surplus at the moment and these numbers could get fine-tuned I've submitted three um budget proposals each one gets changed as we go through another as we go through another month so we're closing in on it the council is going to have a fair amount of Surplus between the year that we're in now and next year and in up to them to decide whether they use that money to continue to drop the mill rate to use it to increase our cash which is something that we it's basically been non-existent and um so that so that department heads will have access to their Reserve accounts which has been very limited in the last year or two so that's really uh just a quick overview of where we are where we are as Apartments um and I open up the floor to anyone who has any any questions that they might ask of me or the department heads in any comments that they might want to share with the council thanks again thank you again your first your first page about eight hundred thousand eight hundred thousand years to pay off your loan correct correct answer that on the term hit the atmosphere [Music] dollars right the mail rate so I don't know what 400 0 so too bad you know so if rather than I know what you want it from the bankruptcy don't pay you no well I mean we discussed this interest that's all well it does and the the new note that we're going to be getting with a half a million dollars that's all going to get paid in June 78 the notes right now that we have process well that it was that's correct but it's eight and a quarter because it's not going to be a Texas Station though and because of racism well so it shouldn't be much well gee we can get in fact we will get a tax anticipation rate on the million dollar amount of credit but not on the renewal of the final result so anyway and even the taxation rate is six percent but the thing is we certainly can do that but you're just what you're going to do it's going to take you longer to get down to the 22 and a half Mills because you still because you've got a budget for that payment s here oh yeah I need to write it right things the point is that you've got to pay that 400 000 . well no no but all I'm saying is me and the 400 000 on Sunday it's like at some points is not going to have to deal with it'll be half yeah and I can tell you that once we lower the notary statement below if you tell to pay to raise it so I that is something that that is something that I'm not really interested in putting in Excel I mean I'd like to see this that should be paid should be paid last year if we're able to do it we're saving money we're reducing the mill rate and next year we will be down between 22 and 23 bills which is where everybody else is so I just don't I don't see how that is not a reasonable way to put us back uh strong physical place they're listening foreign I live on the North Campbell Road I've been living in Caribou since I'm sorry living in Fairfield since 1979. if anybody had told me last fall that Repeat Performance of last year's budget battle I had told him they were nuts didn't know what the hell they were talking about We have replaced an incompetent Town manager we qualified it's experience and capable of addressing the municipal the disaster we had on our hands the national elections two councilors were elected that the community believed would be looking out for the taxpayers interests instead of blindly following the lead of a town manager that was pursuing failing Financial policies who we are today divided on a budget proposal that looks eerily similar to last year's budget sorry that we're not holding we're not careful we're not Presque we're not Fort Camp we're not even close they're in a different League the voices of the taxpayers need more attention in the town's budget development process in recent years that voice has been pretty much ignored altogether nobody should ever lose sight of the fact that it is their money that funds a huge portion of Municipal operations their impressive generosity and willingness to pay last tax bills earlier than they otherwise would have get for Fairfield through an immediate cash flow crisis that Dan inherited when he started to develop based on discussions and interactions with Town officials members of the public taxpayers over the last several weeks is very clear to me there's there's agreement within our community or the level is spending proposed and 23-24 I like most people as well as our counselors do not have enough knowledge about the internal workings of our to be able to discuss intelligently the minutia that goes into it like departmental budget issues Our Town Charter even specifically prohibits the counselors from interfering in departmental operation the most qualified people in town to deal with this are the department heads the town manager who knows that up front however that does not mean the counselors and also the citizens do not have the responsibility for influencing what level of services the town will have and also for setting budget Target rates their obligation is to oversee the big bottom line spending number not the individual that's the job of the Town manager and the department Dane inherited an organization that was on the verge of bankruptcy took on the rule of town manager last fall up to now significant changes in budget modifications have been implemented but are moving the municipal government towards prudent management accounts resources although this has been a great start significantly more needs to be done needs to be accomplished to get this community on some Financial growth there may be a light at the end of the tunnel our tenuous financial situation requires much deeper cuts of spending all of these Town services are shoulders shoulder On The Backs of our spending Trends in this proposal budget are breaking the backs of our tax we all want strong financially sound bright future if we want to get the spending in this budget has to be cut we have no choice or at least 5.2 Mills above anything the budget that's been prepared by Dan and the department says is similar to last year's budget as I mentioned our taxpayers were Furious last year they were freaking fit to be tied anybody really think that different response this year if a budget and a mill rate has passed and looks sounds and smells a whole lot like the budget that was passed last year again this year when Dan was hired as interim manager most of us expected him to address the town's fiscal problems with the objective of getting Municipal operations on Pakistan Financial around we've made good progress we also replaced two of the counselors who support Andrea Powers misguided vision of what some municipal government should look like the tools at a community trusted to help Fort Fairfield spending that disaster get turned around changes echoed with the campaign promises based on counselors Kevin and Jim before in order to address the town's uncontrolled spending problems they talked about the spending patterns look at five years of History going back to 2018. to and including current proposed budget we as citizens of this community are anticipating a significant change in the towns unsustainable spending habits we expect a need to see it now we can't wait it must happen before the new town manager takes over or it likely never happened at all in the last year it appeared these expectations were being fulfilled spending adjustments up until now has been impressed but we must continue the course it's not time to start rebuilding departments a proposed budget has increases in spending in two departments totaling two hundred and seventeen thousand dollars can't keep the tax rate up point of breaking the taxpayers in order to reduce debt when there's barely any reductions and spend it's not fair it's not ethical one difficulty in evaluating budgets try to figure out how much spending is right not much is too much how much is not enough that's a tough tough question to answer because it's a subjective question conclusion is driven by personal opinions which we'd probably get at least 50 opinions here where we should be personal philosophies checkbooks amongst other things one approach is to compare a proposal to some kind of a neutral objective Benchmark such as the Consumer Price Index we did that on the budget income that we left with you at the last Council here in the six-year budget comparison on a budget table spending increase in the town of Fort Fairfield and I'm almost three times the rate of the CPI if spending over the six years increased at the CPI rate proposed Municipal part of the budget be around 3.2 million dollars instead of the 4.2 million million dollar in excess spending is approximately 5 . the bottom line is that the cost of town Services has increased by an extreme amount compared to the rate of inflation it's grossly out of balance with the modest increases in some people's towns people's wages yes we have a comparison of five communities that puts us in their ballpark suggest there are five other communities and of course the county that we could have selected that would give us give us there's a law in the state of Maine that was passed in 2005. where towns and counties are required it's Levy women each year based on local property growth Statewide average income growth past the town of Fort Fairfield to get these calculations on an annual base not known when or why they started I think it would be very important for the counselors to have those calculations look at those numbers for at least the last three to five years so what is fair to our taxpayers what are the taxpayers able and willing to last year our taxpayers were handled handed and likely illegal property tax increase of seven units it's an increase of 36 percent in one year good case and made to return over time we can't do it instantly but over time I think a good argument can be made to turn all of this stupid past personally I think a good start in that direction might need to return at least half of five years we believe that if we control the taxpayers plan to get to something reasonable I think they'll be somewhat patient with us with us our citizens the voters the taxpayers expect and Reserve to see press towards the fair tax rate the fraction of the middle decrease in the opposed budget not reasonable by any stretch of your imagination Jim Robert key Pat Kevin can you look your family your friends your neighbors Associates their employees straight in the face and justify the proposed level of spending you have before you right now never lose sight of the fact that the voters are the ones who put you into your seats through all your allegiance to the taxpayers of this community the town manager works for you not the other way around you need to be directing the town manager not the time manager directing you please do the right thing for this community stop carrying on practices from the past that brought us into the mess that we are in right now simply cannot just continue rubber stamping the budgets that are submitted by the television Town Charter states that all powers of the Town shall be vested come together take charge determined to reinstate the council to its rightful role of being the leader of the community respecting and representing the wishes of citizens I'll close my comments tonight Paul the good friend of mine shared with me some time ago on November 19 1863 Abraham Lincoln delivered one of the most famous speeches in the American history the Gettysburg Address the quote is a next service from that speech the word Nation to to let this town under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish thank you Floors open don't be shy I'm Tammy deshan I've been a resident for Fairfield for since 2013. I've got to say a lot of changes have been made in this town since I became a resident we've had businesses come we've had businesses leave including my own my husband's but I encourage Town counselors Dan and all the department heads keep your heads up we as a town are going to get through this we will get back to where we were we can do this if we stay together and work together as a team thank you everybody hear me I don't talk very loud very good um I'm relatively new to the town and the grand scheme of a lot of people in this community it's obvious to everyone I think the idea that they did not I it takes an aggressive strategy to get as far as he's got but I think the idea that these numbers on the page are not connected to some real cost that the town is going to have other especially in today um the other aspect that we don't get bodies in those positions we need to maintain at least what we have like one of four fairfield's best assets is the fact that Fort Fairfield despite the fact that so many bad things happen to this community over the last 30 years in terms of losses of the base and we've watched communities around us deteriorating to the point where assets and infrastructure really were built for a community that had quite and being able to maintain that I think has a lot of value because we don't away you don't get it back and the cost of getting those things back are incredibly expensive they don't get cheaper and the idea that you can do without those things is also somewhat impractical I mean yeah there are communities around us that have let those things go and maybe they can decrease their budget over time but you also decrease property values and once property values go down to a certain point and that now is now it's even harder to get bill rates can escalate your certain costs that aren't ever going away and if you allow your property values to go down make your community a place where people don't write location we have there's a lot of reasons why people wouldn't want to live there's things that they're paying for they're the idea that they're doing awesome on their budget I mean a lot of communities struggling with their things that aren't getting the things that aren't being paid for it's done well to maintain a lot we have a beautiful mainstream I mean the fact that we can't get businesses here is caution people to have a knee drug reaction and try to push a mill rate as low as possible arbitrarily without real without understanding that there's still going to be a negative payback to get back is late they got no place so what are they going to do if they don't go to school again I gotta do something else that's probably going to have a negative impact a lot of programs that once you lose it's hard to get those things back I think this budget it looks like a lot of work's been put in there's a lot of sacrifices to be made there's a lot of secrets are going to have to make but I don't think we're going to get down to a 15 point okay the property value competitive to our neighbors I mean that's that's the business that a town is in we want to be compared to our neighbors so we can pull the people want from those communities to live here and have that and your memory goes down our property values go well I mean that's a win specific goals to get there into your politics here against I like to evaluate I don't like to jump to junk watch if you pay attention to what we have for assets pay attention to what we have for services and then absolutely the idea that we're the only town that Mill rates are out of control that's that's not real Mail rates are escalating all over the place because people I mean I I think we're not in a horrible position we still have assets that's that's the best thing that we have isn't going I don't know that limestone's ever going to have what we have in business if that comes in so Elizabeth long time listener first time caller I didn't catch your name but I fully agreed with what he said I think there's smaller communities we don't want to be those Salon communities uh I'm I'm see Dan in the care administration uh let me strives that they have reducing the budget the way that it has been I don't know that we can go much lower than this without really really of life here in the town but I know there's it's there's been some difficult Cuts specifically with the library um and I'd like to see those Services come back in a few years uh on the right track to getting there and anyway I just want to thank you guys for what you've done and you're done I'd like to start off by saying my name is Mike's here 1865 I would like to personally thank his chief with fire chief the director for doing it outstanding job in a year of much but there's I think right idea by United debt I agree with getting out of debt probably not going to see much of a town manager come here to a place that's in debt I mean who wants who wants to go somewhere earlier in death for another thing I like this guy and shared back there I like everything you said I really do we're not moving forward by paying off this debt right now we're not moving forward but it is moving in a direction that we need to go this town needs to move forward by what Mr pushard said over there by reducing the mill rate his his participate in this but if you reduce the mill rate by five five Mills four Mills three Mills the only thing you'll be doing is cut services to the taxpayers of this tax everyone that's not just uh the young the old it's everybody I know personally the ambulance service say one of my family members that would have never happened before in a partnership with Prescott would have never happened um Matt's done an excellent job with Police Department iron and confident that shine and fire department who's got the right direction he knows where he's going services they've got to even get rid of men power on you and pile the overtime on to the employees that they've got which means it puts pressure on the down employees more than they need to be home with their families as well and that's that's what you're basically doing um as far as public works I used to work there worked there for some time and director Hansen has done uh outstanding job I know for a fact that he's kept his budget very good standings the whole entire time since 2000 he took over in 2015. so stupid anyway one thing he is he always said to me because this right for the taxpayer is this right for the taxpayers of this town so that being said everything he has up there right now for equipment to operate and maintain the roads is old enough to vote some of it's old enough to buy liquor so this this is not sustainable for this town he does well everything there is safe make sure that but you can take and do repairs and repairs and repairs and repairs and repairs and take that same piece of equipment you just put a pile of money in it and drive it down the road plow for one mile and then break down because it's 20 years old equipment that is in the public works sector is the most abused equipment that there is not because of the the person driving that money it's because of the conditions that it's in all the time so it's not going to be something that we can go out with and I'm not saying that we need to go out and buy a whole plate of equipment I know but we need to start sending some money aside before equipment and pave the roads are terrible most most communities roles are terrible but they have most communities have a some kind of program for uh putting away money monies for Paving Paving I was I had heard that Mr Doe which was unfortunately been the school system it's put away two hundred thousand dollars for parking lots Paving parking lots around school I'm not sure if that's a fact or not two hundred thousand dollars to paid parking lots imagine what it cost to pave a road parking on two hundred thousand dollars quite a bit so uh I'm not going to take up any more of your time to thank council members thank you Mr Foster thank you thank you floors still open don't be shot you might live like a strategy replacement done um I'm not financially Savvy as academies and looking at numbers I kind of look at what makes sense to me and when I was the way things were when Dan took over and the council had a change in September in my mind if we get to pay all that up front we would have paid 70 more Mills than we're paying now and in the course of this year with the budget that was given to Dan to work with Fusion of the same close to three mils that we didn't have to pay this year we didn't continue to still get the next fight in those towns I agree with that with many people at this boat I think do we need to stay on a path of getting that down where it belongs we own a little bit of property in China we pay taxes like everybody else I'm more for trying to get the debt cage but I think what's more important that's happened here in the last nine months is the cohesiveness that our management department has in time for people and if our goal is to move forward in the future and bring a very good time manager here to help us meet the goals that the council sets for we need a good working group in that department and even though it's it huge thing that was done with all of the Town department managers to reduce their budgets this year to get where we are bringing them together to work as a team has been probably harder than that and a lot of us don't get to see that we just get to see the results but we don't know what goes on in the background at the town office or what the council said to do or what the budget committees had to do to keep that moment of going forward I think the most valued asset that your new top units you can have a group of people who work together as a team and that are all working towards four people goals and I think we have that right now I agreed at the returning might coming back into the fire department because it's back where we were 10 years ago we were very Bishop of our volunteers now the work that the public works is doing to try to get by for this year is going to allow us to maybe continue to build our zeros up to buy the equipment that they need all of the people that are working underneath these department heads are all working together right now and I think if we cut back on what they have to work with you can run into problems so we're going to stop losing people we drove through two towns coming up from home last week two towns have been Billboards out there say Public Works hiring so it's a competitive environment out there I think if these people with all of the turmoil they had this year were able to put their teams together and get them working for fourth year Guild we don't want to put a dent in that but stress our we 've been memory down for a couple of years I'd be very happy that if in three to five years Our Mail rates back down where it belongs as long as we're heading in that direction I'm very fine with that I love this town probably more than a lot of capacitor I moved here to be here four years ago and I've never looked back and me and my family want to stay here it's always been our goal and I think that they're on the right path to do that and I appreciate you guys attention the right thing doesn't budget advisory have a presentation or anything um May 17th all May 17th okay thank you yeah is there any anybody else same finger what's the next one of these hearings May 17th yeah what's Fort fairfield's population 3300 okay what do you think what do you want to do it if there's if they're if no one else has anything to either ask or to share then I would ask the chair to join the meeting thank you [Music],True

undying discipline for what he believed in and uh I just want to publicly thank him for his service and wish him and his family the very best yes yes thanks Tommy I just want to go first off I'm Tom told I just want to Echo what Gary and Tony mentioned a few years ago this community was in Dire Straits as far as our ATV trail system the state of Maine was in a situation where they were gonna discontinue the trails before Fairfield because of the poor management and the direction the club was going Ken Stratton took upon himself literally grabbed the ball by the horns it was very dedicated to that cause because of that Fort Fairfield now has one of the best ATV trail systems in the county and again I want to just uh again thank Ken we all feel bad for the fact that he's passed way too soon and I want to pray for his family but thank you very much I'm Kevin Bouchard several townspeople and I have been working on a report that we'd like to present to the council um earlier this week maybe this weekend I placed a request and asked to be on the agenda and I'm wondering if you would like me to talk to you at this time or at some other more appropriate time on the agenda I'll do whatever your preferences are I think we've got uh our public meeting of uh the uh agenda coming up on what date May 3rd May 3rd that probably would be the time to deliberate and discuss uh what what you have prior to that I would think it'd be a good idea to consult the committee finance committee on on information that you have that they could work into the system and and if it works we can we can use that um that's just me talking but so you're saying you don't want to hear what I have to say tonight well no we we would love to hear if it if it regards our budget and you have some uh compelling information that should be shared I think that the uh the finance committee or I'd say finance committee the yeah the advisory committee would budget uh would be the where I'd start they've been working hard uh with this and I feel that if if this is something to be added it would be a good start with them if and what they've worked on up to when the budgets passed will be just good information to add to it and adjust it if necessary I I feel coming forth with information is only undermining the the budget advisory committee I would share it with them and and use this uh to the best advantage if those are the wishes of the council that's fine I don't agree with you at all at all at all I think I'm confused because I'm not exactly sure what it is you're asking to talk about because I I have this but I'm not exactly sure which one Mr chair point of order please okay this is your your business meeting yeah you have agenda with you if you're not going to add an item to the agenda then we're under public comment period that cannot be any exchange of Liberation there should not be any questions responded to at this time we're under public comment period And I think that should continue in that process as I'll wind in here okay policy yeah okay you got the floor how long do I have to pull the forward well three up to three minutes okay um I'm not sure that I can do justice to the report that we've worked on in in three minutes um what I will do is you have our handouts I probably need a good 10 minutes to to explain where we are what we want to do where we want to go this committee Council wants to try to stifle that that's your prerogative if I could take just one paragraph out of the report that we've prepared and that that paragraph represents what we're trying to address why we're trying to offer what we believe to be constructive information I don't want to stand up here and yell at people and criticize people we just got something different we'd like to offer and the paragraph goes I'm sure we all remember the outrage last year uh from our taxpayers over the budget that was shut down their throats and what I've been seeing so far is a budget that's quite similar to what we had last year you know do we really think the reaction will be any different this year from our taxpayers if we provide them with something on the budget and that's quite similar to what was rammed down their throats last year I'm pretty sure most taxpayers are expecting tax bills that are significantly lower than what went out last year I'm not sure we're going to see that so you have our handouts I will provide you with a copy of the information I wanted to give you if you want more information from me I'm always willing to provide thank you thank you any other public comment okay you hit the floor thank you correspondence and reports uh license and permits we actually do have one uh we received a new application for on-premise liquor license for Rivers Edge variety has been sold we have some new orders and the recommendation is that the council will approve that and we would need them we should have a motion on this because it's a new one so if someone could move second in and approve it that would be great application for around second any questions or comments all those a favor yeah hi thank you very much um financial report um we're rewarding our way down uh towards the end of the year um so you have the March financials there is really not a lot to report of different things we're moving in the right direction uh our departments are showing savings towards our final gold um we're not we're not there yet I am a little concerned about the amount of cash that we need in order to uh to pay down uh the Kentucky loan by 500 000 which is what my goal is um it wasn't the original plan uh but because of the amount of money that the Departments have been able to save um by doing this we can if we're able to do this then that allows us to draw the notary if we can't do it uh then uh then in order to in order to pay that million dollars we need to leave the mill rate where it's uh so the goal is to pay that 12 million 275 000 and we're working towards that um and it's going to be a lot clearer come the end of May that's exactly where we are um and so we can talk about that uh and we can talk about the budget a little bit later under reports but as far as the March financials that you receive does anybody have any questions on those okay okay thank you um music Waste Solutions did not have a meeting last month um uh Mark provided us with a monthly update by email those who you have them uh Steve do you have anything you want me to add to the building United in the last couple of days we've had a horrendous milk and I just want to remind the council especially there's some new people on board that we need to keep it in the back of our mind that we should possibly down the line look at working with acoustic Waste Solutions to get a pipeline to our sewing District this is to help with the leachate because the leachate was sending the camera right now but I think we'll spend over five hundred thousand dollars something that could be coming our way so we've done some like working in the past and maybe again I can work well with the board over there but I just wanted to keep the new people aware that it's something we should be looking at because that's a lot of Revenue that is going towards kids that's really good in discussion with the board on that too not lately we've done studies to show where the three potential pipelines would come into Portugal field that's been paid for and the next step was to go from there to see what we would do and to see if there was any fundings either through the Utilities District which is in the middle of a huge upgrade and then possibly look at the northern border Development Corporation to see if there's anything man and we might qualify for them but you know it's just to keep it in the back of your minds it was still working on it yeah thank you very good thank you so the receiving report if you have any questions on any of the information that was provided in the uh um Michael good evening guys and girls um our call volume for the past month was ran on 57 EMS calls and we ran on 14th of our calls it I expect that to go up a little bit where we're getting into Grass Fire Seasoning with everything drying out and stuff but we're we're prepared for that um we recently had an ISO for the most part things went well the timeline on this Friday we had to activate our thumb station so we close the gate for the stream and start bumping the stream into the river we had a few roads closed typical like the same roads every year that the kid closed we did have some high water at the Town Line this year which is quite a bit higher than it's typically been and that was partly due to the ice coming over kierbergan uh typically that that comes over after our ice clears over Tinker um nobody was In Harm's Way just a few issues the water went so high that dot signs got washed out so we had to move barricades and we did have a few problems with with barricades being moved because of the inconvenience of the closed Rogues but as soon as we were notified that the barricades were moved we went and put some more out um the water levels are still high right now but they're on their way down so within the next couple days you'll start seeing a big big difference in the river level one interesting fact that I want to let you guys know when the ice went over Tinker the river dropped seven feet within four hours wow so that's how much water it was was put there we've been pretty busy trying to work on our transfers with the ambulance service to bring in some more Revenue um one way we've been able to start that process is because of the new hires that we have our numbers are finally getting up just within the last week I've got three more new hires one of them a paramedic one Advanced and one one basic well with these as we bring on more Personnel it'll allow us to to do more of these transfers to help with our Revenue um so that brings our toll to 24 volunteer uh environment that's 13 EMTs that range from EMT basic clear up to the paramedic level and uh 11 volunteer firemen so we're getting to where we need to be we're not quite there yet but it's things are progressing we've done three transfers uh within the last two weeks to come up with our Revenue so we're getting there only have to report if you guys have any questions for me thank you guys thank you thank you very much um the budget advisory committee did meet uh on the 12th um and um it was I left around 9 it was a pretty long meeting but I thought it was very productive uh Keith was there Jim was there um and um they're going to be at the um at the public hearing that we're going to have on May 3rd which is coming up to the VFW and then they're meeting again on May 10th uh and they're going to be uh they're going to be drafting some suggestions some recommendations to the council to consider not just for this budget but for process some of the things that we could be looking at in next year some things that that might that might be a good thing for uh management to be doing so I thought that that I thought that that worked really well they determined the terms for the remaining five years for the reigning five members and so by Billy Joe Jason and Danielle will have one years which will expire June 30th of 2024 and Chuck and Ian will be on for two years uh June of 2025 and hopefully we'll be putting one more person on tonight and it is starting next year we'll be adding a seventh person the um you received the packet or the community environment for our assistant Catherine which was pretty extensive uh as you can tell there's there was a lot of thought that went into uh the questions that she was asking and the answers that she received she's going to be she's put together a summary report we're going to be meeting as a group on May 9th I'm hoping that everybody who agreed to interview her with her will be there and the whole idea is to discuss the recommendations uh for the group to breach consensus on the things that they feel needed to see one as a community those are things will then be presented to the community as a whole uh hopefully we'll be able to have a meeting so that if people have any questions this information will be provided online and you know all the ways that we have of being able to do that um and then after that there will be a final report that will be brought to the Town Council for your consideration um so it's uh and this hopefully this will be done by the end of May or beginning of June and uh what will tell us of that will be starting the process to look for a new temperature so we're looking to get this done first and then you come into the council with a proposal or the television search so we've had a little discussion on that but we really need to put together a proposal for your consideration so does anybody have any questions on on the uh this process budget I feel like I've talked about this quite a lot I think about the more that I talked about it um when when I agree to to do this um what I what I basically what I told the council was uh one of my major concerns was finding the next town manager and that we need to find someone who has qualities that we're looking for and I very strongly believed in my heart and I still do that you know unless we are able to get this whole financial issue resolved uh that people can find some peace around the contentious environment that we've been dealing with for the last two years that's going to be very hard to find someone who won't step into this then we will look what their reputation and their career on the line and so I can't over emphasize at least in my mind how important it is that we get these things resolved um this budget is um this whole process is so much it's about so much more than the memory the the taxpayers are what they have been asked to do has been highly highly inappropriate and offensive and I can understand why they're frustrated I can understand why they're angry and I've talked with an awful lot of people about this whole thing but there's a lot more on the line than just that and you know we've got to build up our credibility with the banks again um you know we've got to uh we've got to get this debt paid and um we need to be we need to be on financial solid footing so that in my mind that's really the priority so what I told the council was I'm this fiscal year I've wanted us to we had to reduce the budget now I'm coming in in September we've got a third of the year has already gone by and I'm telling the council we get to reuse a budget that was approved back in June by 400 000. that we need to do that because we need the money to pay off AWS we needed money to pay the interest on the loans that we had that was grossly under budgeted in the budget that was approved in June um and that we were going to need to reduce next year's budget by a million dollars leave in the middle rate where it was because that million dollars that we're saving in expenses was going to be used to pay off the loan well what it looks like now that in this budget year where we stand right now and where the direction that we're moving we still got two and a half months left but we're not going to save 40 . we're going to say closer to eight eight hundred thousand and um and that isn't kind of easy not for me and not for the Departments who have really had to pull this through we've had three uh department heads leave under various circumstances because of this you know we've had people who are upset because we're not cutting enough we have people outside because we're cutting too much you cannot please everyone and and all I'm saying is that the reason why I'm here the goal what I want to accomplish is to get the debt paid that has to be done first before we can do anything else we've got to get that behind us Mike has done an outstanding job we've got we've reduced our long-term debt by over six hundred thousand dollars and that we're going to be reducing our short-term debt by February 1 million 275 000. that's a lot in the course of 12 to 15 months and and we had had some services to be able to do that um it hasn't been perfect that's for sure but we are getting it done our town government is intact you know we haven't decimated it and we've got compartment hits here who are working very very hard to make it work so that has been that has been my goal um and that's what I've been talking to you about for months on hand um I I think that we are very close I think that it is we can accomplish that um we will be sharing this at the VFW on May 3rd and people will come we've had I've had the budget uh made two changes in the budget uh since I passed out uh the your budgets back in late March both of those changes have been put on two uh Facebook pages they can put them on our website we've done the best that we can to get the information out here so people can see it and uh and we'll be talk we'll be talking about that on May 3rd we'll be going I'll be going through the budget in a very truncated form but we'll certainly leave the opportunity for people to get up and share their thoughts share their concerns and things that they're what they're looking for um so um that's kind of where we are right now on this budget does have any questions thank you thank you again uh part of the art of this whole process is any of the work with the bank as you know we were not able to get the line of credit that we needed last year and it was a cash flow language for three or four months and we got through it we did it but when I I met with Greg I told him that our goal is to pay 500 000 on the line when it comes to June 30th that will pay the other five hundred thousand by the end of February uh when we start receiving next year's taxes um and but that in order to do that we're going to be burning all the cash that we have and we're going to need a million dollar line of credit tax anticipation note from July until February and um he is taking that to the board he's planning on having the documents uh for the council to approve um at our main Council so um the I've given him all our budget information I've given the cash flow analysis he's called me a couple times with some clarifying questions um he's they're very pleased with where we've been able to what we've been able to get to uh he at least is supporting the request that I've made and so I'm feeling I'm feeling confident that we're gonna that based upon what we say we can do we're going to be able to get the bank to provide us with with the limited credit that we need and also one of the things that I'm really pleased about is that that line of credit should be on the taxes and Status which means the interest that we pay is going to be uh significantly less than otherwise which is what we didn't get this last year so we had you know we did not get the tax we said well we got three hundred thousand dollars so that that's that's important anybody have any questions um I don't know that I just wanted there's a few things I just wanted to let you know um we've got we've received his Grant something that Andrew started with Karen and Washburn and they call it a resiliency Grant resiliency Grant which has been something initiated by the governor's office um and because of what we've been able to do with this um yeah they actually they actually sent up a camera camera crew in um interview Darren and Mike on the pup station and on how we handle ice out and that sort of stuff um and Tony and I met with Jay cam from nndc and uh we have been invited to the second round of Grants because of what we've been able to do with the first trial um and so this this uh I'm really not looking to go to any conferences but this came up in someone I'm trying to find out that Jay hasn't gotten back to me because I just got this on Friday um and Monday was the holiday uh and Jay has all happened back but uh this may be this this conference that they're having downstate maybe a precursor to the second round of Grants so if it is then I think I one of us needs to go either I or Tony you need to go down to that so I will know I can't answer the question because I don't know I haven't heard Jay is the coordinator for the governor's office for this region so as soon as I hear from him I will let you know but I just wanted to make you aware of that um the the other thing is the we did have only a place council meeting uh which was on Monday that I was driving back from Josh's uh Tony was there uh they had a meeting here they put in uh put on three new members I think it's really important that we support quality Place Council uh either Tony or I will be involved anytime that they have a meeting that they need help from the town or something either he or I will be coordinating it um we we need to tell government needs to be engaged with our volunteer organizations these are organizations that are exist for the sole purpose of benefiting the town of Fort Fairfield and we need to be providing them with support when we can and so I was really pleased uh Matt Cummings uh just got elected onto their board Elizabeth Reed in uh Brianne so I think that that's great and I'm looking for looking for good things to come out of this foreign I just want to let you know um Keith and Jim after being berated by uh Chuck at the beginning I met with EJ Dorsey I got him on the information that he needs he's going to look at providing us with a quote I met with Stacy today from fap1 we've gone over uh the uh the insurance that we have with them and so we we should have EJ did share with me that he Andrea had asked him to do this a couple years ago in his underwriter because of outstanding Queens so what EJ asks for a five-year run report which I which I find your loss report which I got from him and he has a so we'll we'll see if he's able to uh provide a quote button again the other thing is solar farm that we have Andrew had budgeted of the we were going to get a payment this year and I had taken that out on the anticipated income uh I will tell you that I've read the contract Tony and I talked about it um if the contract runs for a runs for a calendar year from January to December and as soon as they are connected to the grid and they are sending out electricity into the grid we can collect that the written other than what they call the development phase and it's a it's a it's a two-year period which interesting enough started on April 20th 2021. a few years is up today and if they wanted they have the option of the contract to extend it for another two years but in order to do so they need to request it in writing which so we haven't received that the person had the contractor who ran the three-phase lines to the site I went up there today they're not connected yet Darren and I'm kind of keeping an eye on that as soon as it's connected I'm assuming that somewhere rather than later that they're going to flip the switch we're going to start sending electricity as soon as they do I plan on sending their bill so we make it the money the other thing uh is in um back in June of 2013 I signed a 10-year lease with police Health Services uh and who ever thought that I would be looking at signing a real 10 years later but anyway that lease is coming due the end of day so I sent a copy of the lease to uh Chris uh Duty and told her that we need to put a renewal together and so I'm expecting to get that from her we'll get that sell agent uh we'll have another 10 years of Applied Health Services up at that site we own the building uh along with pines lean on 75 they own 25 they put when we built it they put 200 and you twelve thousand dollars I think into the construction costs which uh garnered them with 25 interest in the building um so I just wanted to make you aware that that that's happening as well good and that is all I have under reports foreign first thing is um I'd like to ask the council to appoint uh speaker just be to the budget advisory committee to fill one of the interest slots uh Steve has been to the uh the two meetings that they've held about the regular uh Workshop he was at their meeting on the 12th I talked with Jason who is the chair he feels that Steve would be a great addition to the group uh he certainly is up to speed on all the issues and so I think it's appropriate that if it's something he's interested in doing that can also give him fair consideration so I would ask for the council to consider approving a Steve to be a member on the budget advisory committee so move any questions yep all right thank you thank you um I need to uh you folks have already approved the purchase of the uh of the cruiser uh that um police chief and so he's he sold the 2017 which is part of that transaction um we need to have you guys approve the sale of that uh Matt used three thousand dollars of that to go into the reserve account which is where the 18 000 came from when he bought the one that he has now and the other 2000 was used to pay for the installation of the equipment so they took all the equipment out of the old one and transferred over to the new one um and uh so that is how those funds are being used and I would ask the council to approve that a discussion yeah hi Dad hi I'm all right thank you and that's all I have in your own business okay new business only could you do me a favor please um the um this is something that has been going on for a while where municipalities recognize the value of our town clerks we've had some great ones um and Adrian has been no exception to that so we uh they have a proclamation that they put out and so whereas in the council to approved inside a proclamation recognizing Municipal clerks week between April 30th and May 6th which I would just like add is a Red Lifter day but we won't say why and I've asked Tony if he'd read the proclamation please the chip beckless birthday and John Mormons

library she and her husband have generously offered to donate a piano to the library put into the new the community room which is recently redone I've talked to Garrett about it he feels comfortable about in moving it uh the last thing I want to do after going through all this stuff with insurance is to create a workers call claim work in the piano so what I want to do is I I I would like to ask the council to approve us to do this and I want Garrett and I to go it's not going to be a problem getting it into the library I just want to go to see where it is at Barbers and what it's going to be to take out take out and how we're going to transport it um I just I just want to be I just plan on being cautious about doing something because the pianos are not like so uh I I think it would be great to have uh I think it's a great idea um and um I know that it would be used down there uh so I would like to ask the council to approve that recognizing that both Aaron and I are going to look hard at to make sure that if we do do it we're going to do it in a very safe appropriate way so moved any questions or discussions thank you every year uh Frontier ATV Club requests permission to get a utilized property of the town for peerfield homes to have their Trails on every year that we approve that Mr O'Neill came in and met with me uh 18 and I talked about it and he's he's taking his responsibilities very seriously um and they have a very active and worthwhile club and as has been putting up by several people uh a lot of it is thanks to chicken and uh and that is such a great loss to our community so I would ask I received uh the requests from Gary and I would ask the council to approve allowing to utilize our property for their trades second any questions or discussion all those in favor Jim hi Bob hi Pat hi can I vote on thank you um we have a home at uh 153 Fort Hill Street uh that came tax acquired we put it up to vid you authorize us to clear your document our last council meeting uh the minimum bid was five thousand dollars because of the money that was owed against it uh for taxes and interest and liens uh we received two bids one was for seven thousand five hundred dollars the second did was for ten thousand one hundred in one and so uh we are asking the hustle to approve awarding the sale and providing a proclaimed deed uh for uh ten thousand one hundred and one dollar a second that motion okay any questions or discussions dollars in favor Jim hi hi and we have four ordinances it's been a busy couple weeks with ordinances so the first ordinance that you have is and I don't have these in the order that they were written but the first one on your on your agenda is 2305 and that's a utility district right away at Riverside Park they need a new water line and they want to relocate the one that they have because uh where where it is it's in a it's it could be in a much better place in terms of the Casual construction equipment we want again so the utilities are right away that they're that they're looking to is just up the middle of the line for us uh and so it's just a question to be an entrench put the line in pulling it in and we see what happens so I would ask the council to um I just need a counselor to agree to um to introduce it I I so 2305 thank you 2304 is a land that is at um that is that Patty Brooke in that area they have a pumping station there that is in a flood zone the land around they have a very small piece of land a land around it is owned by the town uh and they have to I think they they're putting some new infrastructure in there they're operating that and they want to be able to put that some infrastructure out of the floodplains and so they need some of our lead he has not Landing will ever use for anything um and so I think it is a very reasonable request with past so much Andrew said ordinance as well okay um uh third uh 2302 is uh the building that currently Gary owns Gary sirway uh is being purchased by John and Christine elstrom they want to buy the land that's under it and um and around it to allow them access uh Tony has determined the assessment value of the property owner but I think it's 8 600 dollars and so uh they've agreed to pay the assessed value and so I would ask that we introduced that ordinance as well so moved on introduce an ordinance 32-02 30 2302 just 32. I know that was that somebody wrote that put that in there wrong 2302 thank you um and then the last word is the uh the pad where uh the uh the old Redemption Center used to be which is right next to Gary's building and and so that land is uh going to be conveyed to Gary and somebody who's not quite sure yet like Gary sirway uh and we'll have that on the ordinance once he sorts that out who's going to be the assessed value on that was 16 something like that yeah 16 830. how big 16 830. thank you yep um and uh so I would ask uh the council to introduce that ordinance as well thank you the um Tony is uh scheduling a public hearing uh in which all which will um deal with all foreign we tentatively scheduled that public hearing to be held on May 16th yeah okay and that's all I have under new business okay the uh Mr chairman I'd like to make a motion to accept the minutes in the March 15th regular council meeting any questions discussion all's favors Jim hi Bob hi hi and I've given you a machine with the three words on it that need to be approved Mr chairman I'd like to make emotions on warrant 19 warrant 20 and warrant 21 as the amount stated potions okay any questions discussions Mr chairman I'd like to make a motion towards all those in favor aye,True

that's a good way to do it and a lot of people who don't have a lot coming to say something not right will come up and please take the time to turn around thank you Steve thank you okay if anybody doesn't have anything else here we'll move on to uh correspondence report good evening as you can tell I'm struggling with Parkinson right I have not tested college but I don't know what I've got but I just soon I'd give it to anybody else so I'm a I'm characteristic I'm characteristically try to keep my Congress free I don't have no idea how I'm going to do with that correspondence and reports uh license and permits we do not have any this month to report if you received that February's financial statements and we are continuing a trend of maintaining our revenues and slowly decreasing our expenses you have received the budget that the high department heads put together it is my expectation that based upon the direction that we're going uh as I had as I had stated more than once that the goal was to reduce the issues budget by a minimum 400 000 reduce next year's budget five million dollars if we can do that uh we can get these unsecured notes paid we can uh have a um a small decrease in our mail rate and um we can start to incrementally improve our cash flow the caveat to all this to be able to to do that we are we're going to have a we're going to need a robust line of credit a tax anticipation note so in order for us to be able to plead our cash to pay off this uh 1.3 million dollars um we are going to have to before we make that commitment to the bank there's been a new paper tests that they're going to give us a line of credit that we need because either myself or the next album have to go through what we went through this last fall it was it was it was very hard so with that all being said I I think we're moving in a great direction we still have three and a half months left uh in this fiscal year so any numbers that I have projected in terms of what I'm anticipating across are going to be are obviously going to be different but I'm hoping that the trend will end up feeling confident the trend will continue and um and we can and we will get through this so all in all I think our financial statement is in in a good place any questions at all on the information you received um Cena our last AWS meeting for acoustic voice Solutions was on February 24th we did not have our January financials quite ready yet they weren't finished being audited in Mark as the world's best which is securing the financials he gave us an unaugitive report that said that we were running micro January numbers can be going pretty well we when you're trying to uh be as open as we can in electric removal our transition towards the closing of the Prescott landfill which looks like it may happen this summer so Mark could run the local newspapers to put a news article out there explain why and what's going in that and he said some response from that to the landfill and used to answer questions for people about how the permitting and Licensing is going to go we've also got our license for the Transfer Station Indiana that's a dep foreign landfill he has a preliminary report from Mr President who's over there who said it's just preliminary Pacific there's no changes or anything in there sells five and six are almost exactly the same as three and four all the veterinary suppers here and we're going up to we're going out to bed for a contract to actually do the work on that and we started buying some materials for the lines so that it starts foreign property owner who has a piece of property next to us and they wanted to get Medina right away into their property through ours and just so that everyone knows we voted that down primarily because in the future we don't know what we're going to be doing with that September 8th is and time residential property to live because it's not necessarily a good thing to do ever so if there's anything that comes back to me that counts as a boat ride we didn't let them have it right away that's why they're not landlocked they have a right away from another solid this was just going through the year today that property has been it's been an issue for years with that property it just changed to owners in the new honestly so I don't think I missed anything again um any other questions thank you very much good evening first thing I want to do is I want to thank the board for the classes that you guys sat down and took with me and it was very much appreciated that you're all excited out so thank you guys um our call volume for February was pretty much average for the month we had eight fire calls and 51 EMS calls um Darren and I went to Fort Camp last week to look at their River gauges through the community resilient grant that was really received it will pay for an upgrade to our river gauge and pump house gauge so we went to check it out with green lawn electric and so we're moving forward with that and it's it's going to be a good upgrade it'll it'll actually pop us up with some coffee and some cost savings governor's office on this project and they're sending out a video team to uh they're really impressive this project that we're doing and so they want to talk to Mike engineering and to see the pub house um and everybody making a video on it so I told Mike's here to clean up a little bit um our crews still speaking of the river our crews have been preparing for you know the annual melt and we've been preparing for the the i7 all that's good we're pretty busy with without getting things prepared um want to let everybody know that the volunteer Association has they're putting on a breakfast this weekend on Saturday from 6 30 to 10 30. the proceeds go towards a scholarship fund the graduating senior we actually had two local businesses reach out to help us out put this on and all the food for this event has been donated iron J's Market and rustic Self Storage so for the scholarship for the kids so it's good to see the community together and the people are putting it on are the volunteers of the fire department correct volunteer and full time apologize public volunteers hi 22. we're still building but we're doing good um the last thing that I had is as you guys will see on the agenda the ladder truck better sold yeah good deal yeah it's been a lot of work and a lot of time involved so it's really kudos to Mike for that yeah they're supposed to pick it up yesterday because the snow Easter they postpone it the next Tuesday so that's all I had unless you guys have anything but don't congratulations like thank you thank you good evening um law enforcement is a little different than Fire EMS uh I haven't done a report for a few months now so I'll just kind of give you that from the beginning of the year so far since January 1 our officers have dealt with 701 various incidents with 37 of those incidents resulting in arrest summons the prosecution I've been very busy and the officers have been doing very well keeping up with the calls and cases as they come in so those numbers include self-generated work whether it be a traffic stop or call for service or property checked or citizen assist or whatever so being full-time fully staffed this year the same time last year we were at 299 compared to 700 this year so it's a big difference in having staff uh we've seen an uptick in Wise drug arrests at night crashes officers have started working operation stone garden which is Homeland Security detail which allows us to put an extra officer on 100 reimbursed by the feds and by the state allows our officers to do a bit more proactive police work rather than always just dealing with the calls for service it's a program we've had in the past we're still fully staffed working to hire another part-time officer to supplement um coverage on open shifts we've been successful in filling most of our open shifts this fiscal year with part-time officers I can probably count on one hand how many full shifts that we've had to put out for overtime to a full-time officer which is a significant cost savings to the town it's very good for us to have this reliable group of part-time people that we can count on to come in when we're in a pinch um a notable call that you may have seen on the news on February 28th was the issue with the Bison that was an all-day issue from eight in the morning until almost six o'clock at night and we were able to get two of the Bison back into the pen that night using a citizen to assist some very nerve-wracking situations that day with those bison we had a couple scary incidents where the Bison were head on with an Amish buggy in a horse causing the horse to lift its front legs and the Amish man almost losing control of the buggy fortunately Sergeant Cormier was able to steer the Bison away from the horse and they were able to turn around and get away the Bison were as far as Bryant Pond Road on the the Train the railroad bed that's quite a significant ways for a while Shapiro Hill um we're very fortunate that nobody was injured no animals were injured the Bison trespassed on the ski slope at quality Joe which canceled an event that night and caused some damage to the trails which caused cloudy Joe to have to um re-groom their trails on this day we're able to get in touch with the owner until after 8 PM soon we're dealing with this all by ourselves and one of the devices were made at large for over 24 hours as we got two of the Bison back into the pen we had to enlist the help of volunteers that had nothing to do with this situation to come and fix the fence because we couldn't get anybody responsible vehicles to come help um it's a stark contrast this type of incident as compared to cows and horses becoming loose I mean that's usually an incident that doesn't last for very long but like I said this was nine hours with 4pd I had to call an officer in to help the Sheriff's Office the awarded service the forest service Presque Isle PD it was you'll understand the logistics here and how much Manpower and time that it caused us that day so at urge the Town Council at some point to consider looking into some sort of protections for the town and the public also for a buddy landowners who could see damages to their property from the animals escaping their enclosures we had a lot of complaints a lot of Citizen complaints were some of those and just wanted to bring that to your attention because there's an important issue this was the third time in as many days that the animals were loose we have not had any incident since and the third bison was able to be driven back we are not certified bison Wranglers by any means we have zero training in that um so the liability that was put um in the modern town and our officers is something serious that we need to look around absolutely have you have you been able to talk with the owner of twice I have yeah so what's what's the synopsis uh well he's going to do everything he can to mitigate the Bison from hopefully we can work with him and and all work together to come up with some sort of solution here will there be any reimbursement for costs associated with this uh for the town uh likely not I'm working on something with a landowner to try to reimburse them for damages to their property what kind what kind of what kind of damages just damage to Trails different damages to help yeah yeah anything there in their path I don't have any issue with somebody having bison we just need to make sure that everybody is safe and bison are safe and that Public Safety is obviously the number one priority I know this isn't the biggest issue that we have to deal with in our community in society today but it was it was a very dangerous situation when it was ongoing charge and they're quite large any other questions thank you thank you thank you our support creature Community empowerment project as Steve has been growing well um Catherine has interviewed she has she will be interviewing about 42 people uh she has three left turn up right and she will be compiling a synopsis of of her meetings she will be providing it to all the participants we'll be scheduling a meeting for the group to get together and to come up with some consensus as to how we perceive moving forward and once we have done that then that will be shared that will be shared with the community and there will be scheduled for inward for the community who would like to come ask questions or offer suggestions and then one satisfying there will be a there will be a a final presentation to the to the Town Council for your consideration and then the next step is to start the process of a search for account manager because we've done that done so it's advisory process Catherine has found participants to be she thought that maybe it would take a half an hour and she has been working 45 minutes to an hour and he's been very impressed with uh the key under the thoughtfulness of the individuals any questions on that at all the uh you have uh the budget has been uh given to you folks we are still making in fact I was making some changes tonight um we are going to be getting uh binders together for the budget advisory committee those will be available by the 24th of this month um the is uh our intent that we will get the debt paid that we will incrementally increase our cash flowing and at the moment the budget that you have uh shows a reduced rail rate to 25.75 Mills so it'll be three quarters of account uh decrease once that debt is paid then the opportunity will be there to to make a significant drop in the middle rate but it is really important that we get that behind us particularly as we bring on a new town manager that this is not something that they're going to have to deal with there'll be much more on this as I noted one of the columns uh in in the in the budget that you have is the budget for the year that we're in and then there's a column for the estimate of where our division we're going to be at the end of the year so you know based upon that uh I'm feeling confident that we're going to be able to do as I just outlined I just caution everyone that we still have three and a half months left and so those numbers will be changing everybody this is definitely a working process thank you uh and then the only other thing under correspondence is out to the uh Jonathan uh John halstrom sent me the MDOT schematic for the new Cloud block Bridge uh I just thought I would show that to you I was curious as to where they were going to put that Bridge because they're going to put it on the same footprint and uh it appears that what they're going to be doing while they're constructing it is that they're going to divert traffic to um which is going to be exciting for those folks considering the truck drives that comes up here that might be a trick if some of the trucks up around there too so yeah yeah I know so if they are Domi has them for me it will have some point be available on this so it may be good to have some representation there to talk about the concerns of that but apparently if they are going to use the same footprint this will be pretty difficult to have any kind of traffic there while they're tearing out so that is all I have and um the first thing at the old business is to appoint uh two new members to the budget advisory committee we've received uh two folks who have who are interested in participating in this process Chuck Ainsworth and hope I think they are both worthy citizens to take on this channel and I thank them for their willingness to help the telephone Fairfield outright even if I would ask what you want to do that to serve on the budget advisory for the next two years secretary oh shoot in a second any questions all in favor you know I don't think we can take a lot of time I write about the second item it is uh it is it is sold we receive the check we paid off the loan your life is good I would ask the council to approve the sales so moved one second okay questions all in favor and the last thing that your old business is that we need to uh end the evening uh no it's not annually it's everyday every odd year in January a new um so but it actually the appointment needs to be made in December of the evening year so it's confusing yes we're a little bit late okay so but we're not going to do it so I would ask the council to approve the appointment of Christine as our Municipal registrar who by the way does a great job questions uh under uh new business uh you as you folks are aware uh appreciate having an opportunity to buy a uh used police cruiser with very little miles for a very reasonable price I think it was about eighteen thousand dollars and I would ask the council to approve that purchase that money came from his reserve account any questions [Music] thank you uh we're um rec department has been busy uh I love the other departments but it's a busy applying for Grants we have a wallet Mark Grant to the parks and rec department and you've seen the outlining event I would ask the council to approve that foreign any questions that Jim Bob hi thank you uh they are uh putting on a youth sports rally and they're getting a lot of donations which we're outlining the memo that you received if you want to ask that would be approved as well to move any questions Jim hi I'm all right of we have uh one tax required property that fella brought to my attention it is a residence on uh I think it's lower Fort Hill Street and uh um and we would like to put that out again sooner rather than later with a minimum bid recommendation of five thousand dollars second one any questions no all right thank you very much uh we have what other uh donation to the rec department store and would ask the council to approve that to move a second yeah thank you um Darren are you here somewhere here would like to talk to you about demolishing the potato storage on Cheney Grove he's been working on this so we've recently received a bid to remove the data storage building that the roof collapsing on and so it's really a hazard the property is in use probably for another two or three weeks but as soon as that's over able to move forward with this we've received and bid basically for four thousand dollars with the return per ton fifty dollars per ton on the on the steal to be determined how much will be there a town will pay the ability to be exactly basically for the installation any wood that we can't take care of alongside um you know it's hard to say all how that will all end up but don't see us getting a better meal no no we take care of an issue that's been an issue for a while again that's down to the concrete but that can be you know it depends on what it's used for in the future that might maybe an asset that's right it certainly isn't now certainly not I don't know it's definitely a hazard so we're anticipating in costs maybe somewhere around 3 500.35 or so um and that we have a reserve account for the industrial park is about eighty thousand dollars in it and we would use uh that to fund this so anything over and above do we have to does that come back to approval or we have to I mean if the costs run higher well it shouldn't because that's under contract right yeah okay yeah the only the only the cabinet is how much money you're going to get for the ton yeah and then and then there's the corresponding costs to um that effectively thank you okay all those in favor thank you very much Mr chairman I'd like to make a motion to accept the minutes February 15th on our regular council meeting okay you got a motion

anybody has anything to say the stand okay on correspondence and reports uh licenses and permits we have two we have one uh that I just need to notify you all and that is one for the wine Squad who are going to cater the Silverdale superdraw here in the in the Army so there's that and then we have one that I think you need to vote on I don't see any reason why you wouldn't but I I just think you should it's for River Edge variety and the reason why I'm suggesting that is that their liquor license expired January 21-22. so it's it's expired for over a year and I don't understand the circumstances behind all that uh but they are renewing it and I think that uh before our son I think Council should vote on it so I would ask for someone to make a motion Mr chairman I make a motion that we selling the liquor license workers age second any questions bottles of paper hi hi thanks folks I appreciate it uh financial report um we have pretty good January we pay bills that's for sure uh normally um my expectation was we would take in about a million dollars we end up picking in 1.4 million of which almost a million dollars in the last week so that was a that was wonderful so we got the AWS loan at the county paid um in at school on time which is great we have money in the bank I did call and check we still have a balance on the ambulance we make our payment we make one payment a year on the endless there's seven payments there are four left we paid sent them 150 000 our payment is fifty seven thousand the balance is 65 000 and so um I don't want to wait till June first to make that payment I'm going to pay it off and get it taken care of we pay it now we'll save interest for three and a half months we've got the money so I don't see any reason why we shouldn't so I will I will pay that ahead of time and that will be taken care of um we are in order to cover some of these uh extra costs one of the things that I've been sharing with you in the department hands are probably getting sick and tired of hearing about is that we need to save we need to save about 400 000 out of this year's budget from what was approved in order to pay the AWS loan which was not in the budget and its accrued interests uh on the loans that were not included in the budget I I'm very happy to tell you I'm working on the budget right now and we're clearly going to have more than 400 000. we really are that I mean the department isn't doing great uh they're they've given me estimated uh what their estimated expenses are going to be for the rest of the year uh if that holds true it's it's only an estimate um but if we're able to do that I really think that we'll be able to have some money from the end of this year to put on that million dollar loan which is going to make next year that much easier to be able so I'm feeling reasonably confident we're going to get that loan paid off between this year and next and if we're able to do that that will really take a lot of pressure off everybody it'll be great for the town um you know the department heads have had to live through this they've been created uh and uh Mike's not here tonight and I'll be filling in for him on the fire department report but he's been doing a great job at that whole thing so anyway um the only the only other thing that I had and I mentioned here it's not a lot of money but I'm having a hard time understanding um of the our electric costs particularly around the community center and what it appears is that we have some of last year's bills in lumped in with this year's so we it we had we got charged a disproportionate amount of money in the beginning of the year and which has put us behind and we've been behind right along so I'm thinking that that's the bulk of the problem it still seems a little high to me but I mean we're talking three or four thousand dollars so it's not that it's it's not the amount it's just I don't understand it and I'd like to understand it if there's a problem I'd like to be able to fix it so that's something I'm going to continue to look at other than that I think everybody's doing a great job by really dealing with their expenses handling their overtime um you know everybody everybody's pulling their weight so anyway it's a good good good month anybody have any questions on any of this stuff I would just like to take a minute and thank all the department heads I know this past couple three weeks has been hard on all of them and hats off molliest graveyard you provided thank you Robert Stephen CWS eating pencils our last name against AWS is January 27th at the end of our first month in the year we hit it with our income being around 4.9 head by our expenses were about 12.7 behind so we're still doing pretty well we're about 10 ahead of our schedule for the UPS um sales five and six are applications for that one start this year is it again for the dep everything seems to be going very well they give us a free review and they don't find any problems here you can go to a detailed review and just check this shouldn't be any issues you can expect because five and six are the same as what all the others were I told the same issues again um we put out mostly for Prescott customers a frequently asked questions over here if you want to copy that and make copies thank you guys so you can see it until the concerns are over there we've been doing some tree obviously but we haven't been impacts of an obstacle trees for us to the land in Prescott Valley and Bill and we received about eight thousand dollars from them in January that goes into Capital reserves is extra money for us and your bulldozer is online and operating and you continue to be fun if anyone has any questions thank you very much um Mike is a little under the weather he was in this morning I told you my children for tonight he really is not feeling that well um he is um he's he's filling in on um on calls so he's busy doing that he is taking his basic training uh education which is four nights a week but I don't know if they be Saturday or every other Saturday but it's a lot so he's doing that um he just finished up a fire act Grant which was for six or seven hundred thousand dollars he said he it's he he needs a new engine so I'm thinking that he's putting an engine in one of the one of the Pumpers that's opening that evenings in the comfort is what he means and uh I guess 10 years off the job I kind of I missed that um so he uh that was a lot of work for him I helped him a little bit uh on that and he uh so anyway that's been submitted he's been working on his budget um like everybody else has they did last in January they did 66 EMS calls which has been pretty much indicative of where they've been averaging up a little bit and um with uh and they did nine calls with fire department um I called them out his uh I think his volunteer force is 19 or 21 volts now um and he and I have been we had someone who's really interested in a ladder truck and they finally decided they were going to buy a new one instead so they opted not to buy this one we've had it on the market for 600 000 right now I checked with rooster County Federal Savings and Loan we owed them 398 thousand so I asked Mike to drop the price at 4.95 which he did today we could we need to sell it and it needs to go I mean it's every day that we wait it's just going to be that much harder so I don't even if we didn't owe any money against it we'd be pushing to sell it that's an expensive piece of equipment to maintain due to something that is definitely not practical for this community and so we just need to get up from underneath it so hopefully that's a hundred thousand dollars a year uh in payments and I go through uh halfway through I think it's July or August 27th so he dropped the price of 4.95 and we'll see what happens with that um I think Mike's doing a great job he's got an awful lot on his plate and um he's got you know his budget is a large budget for this town and he's really wants me able to keep the ambulance he's working hard and building up his part-time and on-call folks he's only been on the job for three months you know we really need to give him some time I try to I'm trying to be patient with that but I just have a lot of respect for the job that he's doing so that would be it for the fire department um and then we have Mr dare to speak to Public Works they had an interesting weekend good evening on February 3rd and 4th we experienced a severe Windstorm with heavy blowing and dripping snow and although we have had severe winter drifting during my time before Fairfield Public Works there was a big difference between that first of those differences is our aging Fleet and it's reliability the second is the experience of the crew members there's no substitute for experience in our line of work quite often due to the demanding nature lack of visibility and extreme exhaustion our operators relied on experience and muscle memory to get them through all of which has gained over several years you don't skip that first few times I kind of new seven day a week shift this winter and although it has helped with time off we've still have not been able to attract enough qualified people to fill all positions in some ways we have improved level of service um due to having people out there on the roads every day but without being fully staffed we had less people on the road during major events which decreases the level of service in front of the situation on some of the ways we've increased level of service is you might see us out there on a weekend cleaning streets we're not paying overtime to do that but we're still getting the streets that helps during my time as the Director of Fort Pierce Public Works we've been a successful in many things we have started a small quantity pavement program a chip ceiling program improved our patching process all of which has helped our road system there's a bad need of payment stay possible while saving money for the taxpayers as opposed to Contracting these Services out the one area where I've been unsuccessful is in convincing you the Town Council of the need for major investment in the future of Public Works the path that we are on is unsustainable we need major investment in equipment Paving and longevity of personnel I'd just like to interject you good I'll I've got one other thing I'd like to have but yeah go ahead I'm sorry um I've had a lot of questions about the Reeds downtown and we would have liked to pick those reasons of a month and a half ago but one thing you might notice that every bit of snow that we have on the ground right now which is considerable has come in the last month and a half until we get I'm doing three for four days you know in a row we can't get to the Reese we really wanted to get to them this week as of this morning we had five pieces of equipment down in our shop either for service or for repair um so we need to get those ready and and in the meantime we're also out trying to push back roads get ready for a windstorm that's coming on Friday so there's a lot of things that have to happen people look around they see one good day and think well why aren't they doing that we have a lot of other things the one thing that you know just to emphasize Darren this this right here is uh this was a red letter day for me this was the last uh year that I was Town manager this is the this is the annual report for June of 2013. that's 10 years ago so do you know what the Public Works budget was back in 2013 10 years ago 955 000. his budget in 10 years has gone up 31 percent now you know General government's going up 50 57 the police department's own up 90 percent fire department is the number I can't decipher the Public Works has been and I mean I think it's a deer's credit he's been able to make it work but he he's been trying to be understanding he hasn't been demanding and he hasn't been getting he has not been getting the resources I mean last year he took a hundred thousand dollar cut so we listen we got to get this long page and everybody knows it and but we've got to do something with other terms we really really do so you know we'll be we'll be talking about that uh as when we get into our budget uh process and that's further down on the agenda but I I do I do Echo Darren's concerns we really need to be looking at that there thank you sir thank you counselor okay uh tell me Broadband I'll show that but here's a an update the project is being funded several federal agencies and passing them through to some Regional agencies in the state of Maine Efficiency Maine is one of them and there are ways to capture some of that money but it's specific for underserved communities or underserved areas and there's a there's a report out that was done I'm going to say through the rooster Partnerships Paul Tolls both fit and I've identified a whole series of stuff for the region the state and specifically there were Pages identified for Fort Fairfield and there is language in there how to be successful in your processes and it appears the best way to capture funds is to partner with another community so that instead of having only I'm going to use a figuratively 20 of your communities on on your served or unserved and so the mass of the community is covered and doesn't score as well as a community that has zero coverage right so they score better so it's been suggested by a couple of different people including myself that we and AP Paul told that if we're going to be successful we need to fight with the community that needs the help and uh the real spearhead behind this program started out with the emergency yet Economic Development strategy plan that identified the need for internet and capacity and forth there building mantis is going to go from to everybody back then 12 15 years ago and um Tim goth was hired by the town and he took it on as a project and did some studies we were we were the pilot for the state of Maine and uh Sewell JW Sewell did that study for us and identified the needs and did some mapping into the post and Investments of this community the Investments made by the providers didn't address the issues that we had addressed in our studies and Tim left the community we went to work in a different place about six years ago and the focus was on dovetailing with other thought processities like well pay attention to nmdc and listen to what they're doing and AP and Dan reached out to Tim and asked him if he would take a look but yes the fact the new plan and see if he can develop a strategy or how four period will participate and uh at this time Tim has already spoken to the fund providers and he's spoken to some of the installers or internet providers and he's got a he's I think you've got a great handle on what we need to do next and one of them he was going to reach out to Limestone they're an identified partner Presque Isles got most of their stuff done okay we'll get most of their stuff done Easton is fully a town wide been installed already so the next likely one would be lines when they're the only other writer to us that the project gets well together and I gave him a contact yesterday I think it was who to talk to to at least suggest that and then he was going to come back to us Dan and I with some suggestions and some plans and then we would come to the council with updates and see what we have to do next in order to test they can capture some funds no I appreciate that and I think the thing with Tim is that you know we we're trying to re-engage Quality Place Council But Ken is very very knowledgeable and Tony's knowledgeable in his area so they they work well together um so it's it's an ongoing thing and we're just going to continue to look to see if we can take advantage of the resources that are out there to get the rest of the community um get the rest of the community surge so we just we will be keeping you updated on that uh since you're right there Tony uh the resiliency brand well these are phased project resiliency and we received initially funds that would be used for the highest priority project that we had at the time and that is what I want to call the sutron which is a gauge housed within the pump station down on Main Street and technology is 25 years old and it doesn't function the way it used to you can't can't use it remotely anymore because we don't have a phone but dedicated to it and I believe that Darren has identified a replacement for it they have proposed to purchase that replacement and then it would later be installed they have the funds to buy it I'm of the opinion and so are all my peers that you cannot install it in the wintertime it would be it wouldn't be accurate you couldn't calibrate it you know make sure that the levels were being read correctly and if it's not reading correctly then you could have an emergency situation and not think you're in an emergency situation so that's going to be the the first step of the community resiliency plan this all started um that I can 2021 I think and we partnered with several communities to create a plan we did assault evaluation which um nmdc had forgotten that we had done the self-evaluation they had a consultant gather all the self-evaluations of all the communities that were were identified as a willing participant and then they put this plan together and there's priorities and Dan and I met with Jay the other day and he's going to review our self-evaluation plan and review the study that was done to identify what our next priority project would be when that happens it may be something that will dovetail in with what I was appointed to last your last meeting there they have three Brooks here in Florida Central roasted soil water conservation Services don't want to be seeking funds to identify problems and solutions and and these type of funds are exactly the type of seed money that they may need to capture the DDP fund which I'm going to call 319 units and some other funds from USDA to help the producers like the farmers get into better conservation practices so it's the next step but it's probably going to be all about conservation in order to be resilient you have to maintain what you have in a better way and that's my terminology that's not the plan's terminology so this this program is uh is is being administered by the governor's office and they were really pleased with the way that we handled this first phase so there's a second phase coming out which is why Tony's alluding to and the funding has not been that there's going to be funding they just haven't identify how much but we clearly are in line uh and that's one of the things that Jay and Tony are going to be working on is identifying the funding that's going to be available for us but because of the way the whole thing was handled the first time around we are we are a very good place to be able to get funding for the second phase which again uh Tony will be spearheading for the town in the first phase we had two other partners we identified some solutions for the partners one of them I believe is Washburn and the other one is Carol it's going forward we've spent our share and want to know how much money and the priority for the governor's office whether they would like to have the funds spent that's the path that I believe I'm going to suggest that we go down good anything else while you're right there Tony Library name I'm getting busy well finally I can say that we are in good speed with the community or the company that handles the funds for this Foundation the funds were that we are going to be able to use is nineteen thousand two hundred dollars and I've got nineteen thousand two hundred dollars in a seven day period I was able once I got in once he got me in in a seven day period I was able to draw down all of the expended today it was about fourteen three I think it was correct and we have a little bit of funds left over and they're going to be used for the uh the Drew room I believe for historical documentation to help maintain them so that they don't get destroyed by sunlight or use or wear and tear and there's a plan that's an excellent plan it was well scored and that's going to be done but we have to be done and spent by the end of March March 31st correct they must include in the program director's final report but we've done initial reports and we've done initial drawdowns and we have a we have a very good path to the rest of the funds and I don't see any any hurdles that we would have to go through capture the remaining grant funds and there's no match requirement zero match requirements we've been through enough I don't know of anything else that would be of interesting yet other than we're going forward and wearing a good step you get a pack of the funds any questions thank you thank you for listening one more folder here it doesn't tell me everything um Fort Fairfield Community empowerment project uh we're on our way um we're going to be the um a proposal that Catherine gave us has now been put on our website for anybody who wants to be able to read it and see it and uh Nidra has been working with our is it a webmaster is that what you would call us sure the person who's responsible for the website it needs to be updated um the little boxes cannot be changed because of the programming and so Nidra is working with her to make the changes so that it becomes more usable if somebody wants to see that program you need to click on the box that says for immediate attention we can't change for immediate attention to Fort Pierce Community empowerment project as much as I'd like to um so so we have done that the dates have been set for the interviews and and I will be I'll be scheduling those um this will be a um this will be a good first step uh for us to look at uh where we've been and how we want to move forward also the game plan for uh preparing us to start the job search for Newtown manager and um uh I I am feeling I'm feeling very confident I think Catherine is very well qualified to do this to facilitate this process I think I like her plan she's got a great plan uh in how to do that I'm hoping that it's been establish some new Norms uh that is going to help us be more Vigilant and not allow us to end up in a situation that we ended up in that really is the key and it's a it's a community thing you know it involves Council it involves the town manager it involves the department heads and it involves the community so um I think that I'm feeling good about this and we'll be I'll be reporting on it every month moving forward um and you guys can hear me any questions on on the process okay great thank you um Nim streaming I I'm feeling really bad that Michael's not here because I can tell you that um this National kitchen management system I understand it's important I'm not disputing that it is um it is something that I'm I've gone through it I've taken it I'm glad that I don't have to be involved in administering it I can tell you that in any event uh both Matt and Mike are applying for Grants grants are available continuously and they are working and doing that part of the grants it is required that the elected officials participate in the uh in the basic program that they have it's a two-hour webinar and so you have the sheet and so what Mike would really like to have at least two of you folks be able to take this uh program either on the 9th 16th 21st or March 2nd I think Jim has agreed that he would be willing to do that with Mike with Mike yes I don't know the date if he can do it right well I'm sure he can fit it into your schedule I don't think that's going to be a problem uh is there anybody else who thinks that they could be able to find the time to do this please what do you do with that great thank you so much so I will have Mike reach out to both of you and three of you did it together I think that would be great they can also do it on their own right you can but I think it would be much it would be much more helpful to do it with somebody like mine or Matt yeah but Mike you probably [Laughter] period how far is did you hear him oh yeah yeah great thanks guys I appreciate it and I will let him know um last thing I happen she's going to get back up when we're done I'm sorry um we received the report on the work plan for the next three years actually well including this year 23 24 25 from MDOT and guess what four characters on is praise the Lord so I will let Tony has been uh working with them in with um nmdc on this so this is that let me give you a little bit of background of why this is on your table today I am the President of the Brewster county boat auction report and nmdc receives funds to train boat officers so they can continue with their certifications and they put together a listing of what they were thinking of providing and they were they asked me if I thought of anything else that they could train us on and I put together seven items for them to add to their list and one of them was Regional Transportation and I approached the topic with them by saying we used to always get reports from the regional advisory Boards of Transportation with people and we would know what was on the two-year plan for immunity work or Five-Year Plan or ten year plan and we could be able to add to them for a reason not the priority based on our communities involvement but if we we haven't received that kind of information for a long time I don't know about our attack group is still meeting or hasn't met and I told Jay cam I've been in UC that the reason I thought it was so important to us is items like Main Street and Presque Isle Street went on the last studies and we've been identified as one of the top three three of the worst travel places roads in the state of Maine for the least five years and we're trying to get it onto their list of projects to do and hence he provided me of this he says you're wrong you're on the project agenda and this is uh at first I send them a message that I don't see any work on Main Street prescotti's scheduled or planned for 2000 through 2023 to 20.5 very little work on projectile this summer email me back said that if you read the fine lines the identifiers our route number is not Street numbers and their views were proposed for 2025 uh 24 20 24 25 for those two lanes that I was talking about Presque Isle Street at Main Street and a significant portion of those roads being worked on and it's not going to be a minor constructing project it's going to be a reconstruction project so again it's not identified for this summer maybe late next summer or the of 2025 period but there's other work that needs to be done before they can start to work because they don't want their Road once it's been repaired to be scarified in any way or ruined in any way so it's on the list of things to do finally there's funds that have been earmarked for it finally I think we don't need some of the infrastructure ones that are coming from a federal requirement Transportation monies and other satisfied infrastructure monies that were just voted on in the last year and there are other smaller projects that are going to be happening in Port Fairfield most of it's around the bridges prepares to the two front walk and the main street or my Sloan Street Bridge we don't see any other major characters in America well I still had a minor project so that's what you have before you that's the rationale of why you have it before you and that's just gives you a little insight as to we're still working on trying to prioritize their work and make sure that they agree and I believe at least Senator Collins office and Senator King's office have both been working on their side to see if they can create up some earmark on these identify for that people stretch a road as well that's not a dead issue any questions that's all we have for reports this evening okay not a new business thank you um first thing is the budget advisory committee I would like to let the council know that we have two vacancies we've had one name has been presented it hasn't been uh publicized and I I did talk to to get that on the website it just I don't know where they find it would be the problem because of the issues that we have with the home page so hopefully David will put that in the paper that we anybody's interested in serving the budget advisory but please step forward and let us know we'll have a list of names uh for the folks to consider and you can make it so we'll do that the other thing the thing I would like you to vote on is I've been working on the budget as well as the department heads and I've put together a schedule and it kind of worked backwards so what we're looking at is that the budget gets approved at the new council meeting um and so that will be on June 21st in may we have two public hearings so normally the second public hearing while I say normally in my normal the second public hearing would be the third Wednesday of the month and we would do it before we start the regular council meeting and save you guys from having to have three meetings the first budget uh public hearing would be on May 3rd which would be the first Wednesday uh and then we're going to have the budget workshop with the department heads and the town manager and I want to schedule that for April 6. we would start at four o'clock because it's it's a it's a long day uh so I would I got two things I'd like to counsel to vote on one is I would like for you to approve that schedule I would appreciate it if you would the second thing is that um the budget advisory committee needs to be fully informed as the council is about a budget that's being proposed and what I would ask the council is to allow the budget advisory committee to meet with the council during the workshop with it with the Department of the Town manager and that they would be allowed to fully participate just like the council so if they have a question of me or if they have a question of any department heads they can ask those questions uh just like you folks will be able to um and then they would be able to meet afterwards at their discretion uh and uh and if they would like me to be there I'd be happy to be there uh if they would like an apartment yet I'm sure we could work it out though hopefully that shouldn't be necessary if they get to see the department heads see the numbers and ask the questions then but I certainly have no problems at all in meeting with the budget advise committee when they have their meeting so I would ask the council to approve two things the the schedule as I've proposed into allow the budget advisory committee to meet and fully participate in the budget Workshop Ico motion both with those items thank you second any questions thank you very much uh and the second is uh uh Mitch was our um appointment to the NDC board and since he's heading off the council he has resigned we it normally it normally would be a counselor it doesn't have to be in the past there have been other folks I did not get any response to the two emails I sent out um and so if there is no one here who feels that they can have the time or prefer not to do it um I would like to recommend that you appoint Kevin Bush on second and Kevin's okay with it I would not be presenting your family okay yeah yeah okay yeah so we got our Motion in a second that yeah well I have all right thank you very much and that's all I have with your new business Okay so we've received the the minutes from Dan and from our special meeting on February 9th in our regular meeting on January 25th so I'd I'd ask for a motion to uh accept a minute says read I will check those minutes there's a one error spelling error not calling bank but back so suppose okay motion second any questions all right Florence we have one warrant a big one Mr chairman I make a motion we accept warrant number 16. as presented take Motion in a second any questions Pat hi Jim hi Bob hi can I go right and we do not have anything else we do I'm sorry I would like to ask Mr rajeski to speak on behalf of a question I asked you which was the cost of running the street lights and the Greek life and we did an investigation and sold me over the phone and I because the way I could repeat it he did a lot of math so please explain that to us uh well I referred to the U.S naval reports on a day like I was and they will actually tell you the daylight hours per day of the year when we took those in averaged them is about 4 100 hours of nighttime activity or difficult for the year 2023. by taking half of the decorative street lights off the hill it's really a decorative tree lights including the release which is very very little power I checked in it that roughly 152 lights it would be affected by this so that would mean if you would pick 76 offline if you take 76 likes offline follow that 4100 you would save it up at least three dollars and six cents a day yeah that every little later on those lights are super super efficient and I think if you to multiply that out you see a little over a thousand dollars a year by not having every at the light on are they are the lights wired stay so it would be easy to do that at one time Danny work the five of the seven boxes that I checked was Jim had requested um shutting them off Tony's not a problem because we can just disconnect the wires from a relays one of the things that we get done over the years because we want to try and maintain all the lights individualities as a really really bad just use the existing one to hear the whole load because it never below right so I think take one half of wine with the YouTube ads I mean it's a matter of History just disconnect and move that really into boxes so you have to do that with each individual light that you're taking off line no uh it's strings of light skin I don't know I think the seven boxes throughout the town right where these lights are controlled I um the only lights I'm not sure about are the ones that arriving the municipal run I mean most of those who are called from the very beginning just took down on one okay yeah but as far as the only able to get the electrons so that's roughly what you're looking at Jim I was surprised so it really it really zoomed right in on our latitude we longitude yeah thank you Mr chairman I make a motion on your job oh oh we got something else no I was just checking with the guy no okay motion stands okay Bobby emotions for German y two motions that we share um,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,dIthRA5wcY8,Special Town Council Meeting 9Feb23 (2),,5.0,289.0,2023-02-10T15:44:27Z,none,68,0,0,0,exact ly exactly yes okay okay all in favor aye aye okay Mr chairman I'd like to make a motion to accept the contract of CEI Consultants at the price of twenty five hundred dollars for phase one as presented a second okay any questions I'd like to have a discussion but okay and this not being negative I'm just trying to do this because I can't imagine we'd want the other uh affirm that um present information on but I assumed that it won't they didn't you didn't ask him here because they don't have time or no no the uh I didn't because my recommendation of council is that we retain patrons and not the other individual there was no sense in I mean the the difference between the two programs I'm just learning that's okay James you asked all the questions you want it's not a problem um but I just just so you understand what I thought the the uh the other the other proposal we received was I did not read it 100 times and that's the proposal I wanted right okay so there would be no there would be no reason for uh in my mind for the council if if there was a if you folks decided that look we're just we just don't think that she's right then we would need to revisit we need to look at the second one quite frankly if if you folks felt that way then I would just think like we need to we need to read water because I would not be in favor of recommending the other proposal you're going to find out on this first and if it works out in this first phase that's a cheap point this is this is yeah this proposal is much more in-depth um there's just this is there's much more substance yes it is seems like she wants she clearly wants to do it but then she also has um you'll notice that the last page uh that document that I gave you is the um it's sort of if I think about the mission statement but it's it talks about she was talking about the car seat School of Management okay yeah and it it talks about and it's it really is um I'm thinking like wow I wouldn't really go into that it really is um in terms of public discourse it really has things that we need to be looking at and public discourse you know doing these sorts of things in the public is very different than a private business and and you really do need a good skill set to facilitate that kind of a process oh yeah I think Catherine has a tiger too you know we're very very impressed with her promotion the discussion cease okay I can't talk anymore yeah so we yeah so we get a motion in a second for the proposal Catherine to facilitate our Our Town manager search in Phase ones so motion a second so go to vote all those in favor Pat hi hi Jim Bob hi Kevin all right I will die thank you guys I think we're off to a good start keep going we we will you know you enjoy yourself down there while we work up here okay buddy weather coming in tomorrow so check your advice okay I'm sure you will all right yeah I think so yes thank you all those in favor aye aye all right hi guys thank you so much I really appreciate it I always try to pick on you yeah,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,w-eRSc-mL8M,Special Town Council Meeting 9Feb23 (1),,15.0,900.0,2023-02-10T15:38:00Z,none,158,0,0,0,right well it's six o'clock I call the meeting the order uh like to ask manager everyone is here everyone's here yay a person in the spirit we pray for our country at all times that all citizens are safe healthy and happy we pray for wisdom for all those who guide and govern help this government body in every situation to know to do the things that are right and just with soundness of judgment and making vital decisions we pray for the peacemakers that the Holy light-inning Spirit May ever dwell in their hearts and the barriers of free suspicious fear suspicion and hatred may fall as we pray to the Holy Father amen amen amenities to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with Liberties and justice for us foreign uh did they get a copy of the mountains they did um basically what we're looking at I went and looked at this chart today it's in better shape than it than it showed in the pictures it's it's a it's a very nice trust one thing I realized while I was looking at it we had talked about uh we wanted to maybe look at f650s a little bigger cab but they're looking at that truck I realized that the suspension and everything is almost the same they're much more substantial than our one tons the truck has a plowing Wing but what we're really looking to do here is kind of diversify our Workforce we're having a hard time getting close with CDLs we're looking into maybe being able to put more people on the road at any given time and doing that with part-time people you're not going to get a full of part-time people with CDLs we just it's just almost impossible to come so one thing I noticed with this truck like I said the suspension and the the running gear on the truck is pretty close to that next level truck but the cab it feels like a pickup so if you put some money in at the class C CDs or Class C driver's license they're gonna feel comfortable and we really got to think about that as well so we're looking at we have some wheelers we have some wheelers that are in decent shape um we we have breakdowns we could have a fleet of new wheelers and we're going to have right now when you have jelly issues uh when you have air brake freeze up issues that can happen to a brand new truck yeah I'm not saying we don't need new equipment I'm saying that we need to maybe think outside the box and move in a New Direction and I think that this truck is that new Direction one of the things I just like to throw in is that as I'm working on budgets um I've I've really come to the conclusion that Darren Mike and Matt if they're going to have Bible departments that are going to be effective in departments that we can afford we've got to have a core group of well-paid full-time people but we they're going to have to be supplemented by a part-time if we have if we took one of Darren's drivers who makes forty thousand dollars a year and he took the family health insurance plan his benefits are going to equal 74 of his salary we can't we can't afford that I mean it's not sustainable I mean it's not going to be too much longer if we continue to handle health insurance Where We Are that benefits are going to exceed salary and um it listen it's part of the world that we're in we can't not do it but what so what we need to do if we're going to have viable Department in reasonable budgets we really need to be focused on how we can use part-time people more and what Darren's talking about doing and you couple that in with the the weather that we've been dealing with over the last four or five years snow just keeps getting less keeps coming later goes earlier um I mean he's been out there playing with Valentines and he's wearing gas instead of diesel the other thing is is that these trucks um you can get a really nice truck for a lot less than what you pay for wheelers so you can get more audience which possibly could be shortened runs which means that you can keep a Road open just by itself applying or nothing or more right so I I just I I like the direction that they're going uh I mean Darren has been thinking about doing this this just came up if he's able to get it then um he's gonna he's gonna he's gonna be able to get it right off he's gonna be able to use it this winter and so he's going to get a feel is this really going to work for Fort Fairfield and it's not a lot of money for us to figure it out and if it is we're going to save a lot of money down the road on equipment we're going to save money on roads and um and we're going to be able to utilize uh quality people to drawing on a part-time basis without a CDL and that is a big big plus when I saw the picture of it you probably won't believe what I'm going to tell you but I said oh I do better go drive so plow now sure and I I got a CDL I would not there's no way in hell I would go driving instructor he's got a CDL right there right but you you would be surprised at how many people I hear that from uh driving a truck over the road or driving and doing what we do in a snowstorm are two very different things and where will you be using it probably be using it so my vision in the winter is that that that truck would have a plow run during major storm events other than that it will be a cleanup truck we'll we'll take it out and take care of minor drifting if you're gonna run out to Steward Hill and make the pass to clean up some minor drifting that truck would go rather than a Wheeler it's just cheaper to run it's just everything on it is cheaper yep including the purchase price right um but ideally how I see that truck functioning is during a major winter event the the uh we have some rows that below last you know they're uh they're just easier to maintain you would take that truck and it would take care of a Dorsey and Pedro and it would be a short run it would be limited but ideally if it works out this winter we have three or four of those we have three or four people coming in late times the roulette and they're taking care of you know six seven mile runs and our wheelers are over on the roads that really need it the West Center Strickland Murphy I live out there exactly so you know exactly what I'm talking about yeah because you know not those roads last weekend took up you know 70 percent of our Focus yeah that's just the way it works the trucks have to go right back and forth this truck to do I I uh I'm anxious to see this I plan on spending quite a bit of time in it myself this winter just to see really what we can get out of the truck I'm going to ask you a couple of questions yes I know the answer but I don't want everybody to help to hear it do you put a wind mount on it no sir and and the big truck somebody learned you better have an older men yes it would be a wingman's last trainer yes right yeah no I think it's a good call I I think I think it's a step in the right direction oh yeah and I look forward to what comes up yeah absolutely thank you do you uh well do you have you have people like that's working for you right now that that are full-time but they don't have a CDL I have two I was the thought that I had earlier I mean we pay we pay for the police officers to go to academy so what so was there a way that we could you know maybe fund a CDL license program you've got to have so many hours on the road and there are insurance companies probably want him to have two years of experience whether they want to ensure well no I I think that we could insure them if there's a cost to everything right so it's going to be an increased cost um last I checked last fall into the cost basically what people want is they want you to pay them while they're going to the school it's a 12-week course and it costs four thousand dollars so by the time we get that person through the school and I'll share with you that we hired two people with a CDL last fall and each one of them after their first storm said this isn't for me one of them decided to stay with us through the winter to help us get through he's still with us today the other one didn't make it through his two weeks notice he had had enough it scared him right to death so it's kind of a big liability for the town to take on you know yeah you can you can do paperwork and you can say you know if you make it through if you make it through the class and and you don't pan out for a year you're going to pay us but then we end up in your court yeah I think it's on long lines maybe a couple year contracts you know what I mean the way the way that works with the police department is that there is an agreement with state and local police departments that like we just had whipperman with go through that yeah and yeah Caribou comes calling and say look we're going to pay you five dollars more an hour to come work for us they they basically buy his contract and they've agreed they will pay for that because it's the same deal you've got you've got the cost of the school plus you're paying your salary plus you're paying your trust yeah so it's it is expensive all I was thinking though is if you found if you had the right guy under your wing right and you knew like I mean that's something that I'd be game for you know if we if we had to invest in people right yeah I think there's a possibility that we could do something like that yeah but you're absolutely right it would have to be the right guy and you know that person when he walks through the door well do you know how we could find out who the right guy is we put him in this S550 and let him files yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah fair enough fair enough yeah that's a good point yeah that's a good point here I have one question to you again um I know the reserve thing that we're getting through right so yeah this is explained to us where the money is coming from the uh Public Works has 300 and something in their Reserve account so their Reserve account is funded our issue is we don't have cash in the bank or we didn't right so he may have 300 000 in this Reserve account there's nothing we can do about that because we can't write the check but you know that you have it in weird we're fine we're fine with that that's coming from the new generated tax revenue um it is it's coming from the reason why we got plenty of cash is because people are paying the property taxes yeah so it's a combination um the it it's um see this doesn't affect our budget because it's coming out of his reserve account yeah the only thing that would affect is our cash flow yeah and our cash flow is fine and it's going to be fine for a while and uh with what we're going to be eventually what we're going to do about our cash flow is we're going to be sitting down with guitar and trust and we're going to be negotiating a a line of credit that's appropriate until we get our you know until we get next year's property practices okay so that is uh so yeah this this impacts the cash flow not the budget yeah because he has money in his reserve account so so if this would have happened sooner we wouldn't have been able to do it right right right right because we still have the money yeah we did yeah yeah I don't know if you saw

clarification Comfort Council um if we have a new license it would require um it would require a vote of the council if we have a renewal uh it's supposed to come to the council for information so I just just wanted to point that out so tonight we have one which is a renewal and it's for the fishing games thank you can you hear me there sport yes I can hear you I just uh he's got the camera right there I'm just saying you're good right there okay good right there okay all right good thank you thank you Robert Robert has a new job now foreign so that's it uh financial report um I've sent you the certified letter that I got from the county uh reminding us that we have a payment that evening made by January 31st and I'm happy to tell you what that famous so we're paying uh twenty eight hundred dollars in interest price that you pay when you can't pay on time and so hopefully this will be the one and only time this ever happens but it is being taken care of we I sent you the uh the financial uh reports for uh the month of December and um a couple of points that I I would want to just make for the council and for the community is that as you know I mean we still have the 275 000 that we get paid to the PWS and that's going to be uh paid by the end of the month as well and I'm feeling very confident that we are going to be able to do that for a couple of reasons one is is that our uh receipts on taxes have increased uh fairly dramatically this past week which has been I was really uh concerned December was less than what I had anticipated less than what it had been in Prior years so I didn't know what that meant for January but it seems to me that that is not going to be an issue so I'm hoping that um I'm hoping that our cash flow issues that we've been having to deal with are behind us uh we've only had to use 175 000 out of our line of credit and I'm not anticipating having to use anymore and that will need to be paid to the bank the uh um I did get a call from the bank today and just want to know how we were doing and um they do award to enter into discussion regarding the million dollar million credit uh that is held over from last year you know what our plans are on paying it back and I did spend a little bit of time talking to him about um you know we talk about the the mill rate that we that we had to raise so dramatically and um you know we talked about the debt that's got to be paid um part of the problem is is that you know we we have a little cash so we have no money so I mean literally we've been broke uh that has slowly starting to change but the only way that we're going to enter increase cash is that we have to spend less than what we take it and so if we're going to be aggressive about paying down debt then clearly we're not going to be spending less than what we take it because we're going to be spending what we take so if we create a budget that balances between income and expenses the way that we do not run into the Casual problems is that we have an adequate line of credit to get us through those months when we are not receiving the income from taxes which is basically late summer and fall and so my conversation with guitar and Trust was that there needs to be there needs to be a joint uh agreement regarding our commitment to pay off this loan is a million dollars and their commitment that they're going to provide us with an adequate line of credit so that we do not go through this cash flow problem again that there's got to be a relationship between the two if they're not willing they put us through the same thing that we went for this year then my I'm not going to be recommending to the counselor that that we're going to uh that we're going to aggressively pay down that loan because we need money in the bank to pay our bills so then we don't deal with this again in worrying about paying the school of the uh Jim Joel was was very um uh gracious in working with us because there were three months that we didn't make our payment over time to the school and um and that's that's not right so anyway I I don't know if it won't be me but whoever is going to be the town manager I do not want him to have to deal with this and I know I absolutely hated not paying bills so anyhow that that is that is an issue that we have and we're going to be continuing to work towards that and I I told Craig that we would be talking uh but I have a better idea of what we're able to do and I uh but as I pointed out on our expenses as of the end of December we were six months so typically you would expect that we were spent 50 of the money that was budgeted and what we've actually spent is 44.5 now for us to save that four hundred thousand dollars that we need we need to be around um 43 or I'm sorry we need to be around 5.22 of our budget and the 44.85 is 5.15 so you can see that we're pretty much online uh Mike is doing a really good job with the fire department we're going to see more savings there so I'm feeling confident that we're going to be able to meet the obligations that we're not funded that need to be paid uh this year so um we do have some issues on the on the income side money that's the budget that I'm definitely will not be getting so that creates kind of a that creates a whole other issue but I I think we're going to be able to to get around that I think we'll be able to save enough on the extent side and I can tell you that there's absolutely no way that we would not be able to do this if it wasn't for the work of the department because they're the ones uh with their departments and um and they have been very supportive of this process and I'm appreciative of that so I think that's about all I have to say about that if they have any questions from the financial center I would just like to take a minute and thank Our Town manager uh that wasn't an easy task to bring him in uh into this financial status that we were at um and I just want to thank you thank you for a great job that you've done to bring us where we are again we're not done yet but we're working on it thank you thank you foreign [Applause] in the EPA the Federal Environmental Protection Agency has cut some great available monies out there for us to go after uh to look at recycling things so if anyone has any good ideas on Us increasing the recycling rates Mark is very open to looking at those events that are started the operating goals a piece can go up so if anyone's gets some input either set it through me or Dan or Dr Mark directly out to landfill we appreciate whatever input you have great great thank you thank you thank you Michael what's going on all kinds of stuff going on um I wanted to talk to you guys about our call line uh for the month of December we had 56 years so it's been a busy December was a busy month and so far to this point excuse me Kevin can you hear him can't hear him very good at all again yeah okay I could hear you I could hear you fine I can hear everybody else I can't hear I can't hear the podium okay got it okay so in December we had 56 EMS calls which is 10 more than November and so far in January we're already at 56 we still have a little bit more time left in December so it's been a bit it's been a busy January fire calls December we had 18 uh which is up from four in November and so far to this point we're at eight uh for January okay um members were up to 22 volunteers I think two from last meeting so we're still gaining we're not where we need to be yet but we're we're making the progress um trainings one thing that we do with the volunteers is we train weekly and the last month of trainings the attendance has been amazing so we're really we're headed in the right direction um lately I've been involved in the ENT class I talked to you guys about I'm two weeks in 14 more to go um I've been working on some grants the assistance the firefighter grants is finally open it opened on January 9th it closes on February 10th I'm looking to put in for a fire engine um the cost share to the town on that would be five percent which is well amazing um it's a very competitive Grant so um there's no guarantees on it but we're sure gonna try our best for it there's also a few other grants I'm working on in the middle of all this as well there's a bunch of different safety grants that we're going to look into to see what we can move um help got cost and for safety measures as well um the ambulance that we just acquired the use room I want you guys know it's been running great we took it on its maiden voyage yesterday and not only did we use it once yesterday we use it twice so um helping us bring in some extra revenue and it's already unfortunately it was so um lastly I want to talk to you guys about the ladder truck we've been talking about okay the ladder truck um last week we had a department from North Carolina fly up to Fort Fairfield to take a look at it they spent the entire day going through it running it inspecting it and uh I think it looks pretty promising they're supposed to be putting a presentation for their board so well let's we've got some hits we got some people planted here and I actually just finished out an email today that we might have another department from Virginia that might be interested taking a flight up to Fort Fairfield to inspected as well so we're making some headways great job yeah so that's awesome yeah so if I do get a decent uh proposal to the board all I've got for right now if you guys have any questions or anything for me thank you thank you Mike um on the county broad Bean report uh this is something that has been going on now for a while and quite honestly I'm not going to up to speed on it um I tried to I was going to email you the action reports over a thousand pages to come out again I couldn't I couldn't put it it's too big for me to put it on as a as the attachment so I did send you the fort Fairfield part of that which was like 12 pages um the one of the things that I want to do is um well I want to uh I would like to get quality Place Council involved there's a couple of reasons one is is that Tim Goff who's the president uh when Tim was the economic development director he spent a lot of time on broadband and um you know I would like to get him re-engaged uh Tony and I have talked about it Tony would be a liaison from the town to the quality of place Council uh we scheduled a meeting uh that I would meet with them on February 1st and we're going to be spending some time talking about um talking about this and also uh basically getting them re-engaged with or getting the town re-engaged with them and um I I don't know um how many of you have seen this this is a report that was done this is a report that was done some of you people might have been involved in this um that involved close to 100 citizens over seven or eight months um had 10 different committees in the in the result of all this work that people had done uh on this on this last page it talks about the implementation and basically what it says is that there's a recommended account committee be established by the Town Council to oversee the implementation of this plan and that the town manager will be responsible to the committee who will provide periodic reports of the Town Council regarding its progress so the reason why I bring that up is um you know we're getting ready to start a search for a new town manager and I think it's fair to say that everyone can look at the situation that we're in and are asking how did this happen and what are we going to do for water from happening again so the reason why I mentioned that right at the moment is because all the work that was done here uh that was approved by the Town Council we had a town manager come in Jim Reisner who decided that this was no longer a function of the town and just and told the quality police Council they could no longer meet in a town building uh he told Tim Goff that as quality as economic development director you no longer can participate with their work I do not want you doing that that is not a good use of town resources so I'm not sure I understand why Mr Horizon thought that that was the appropriate thing to do but what I do not understand is why there were people who didn't stand up and say wait a second you know you don't set policy you implement it that's what child managers do and we just sat by and let that happen that's part of the reason not because of this specifically but it's part of the reason why we get in the situation that we did because people were allowed to do things that were not within their purview and and and not enough people stood up and said wait a second so you know we get we get some systems that are not working are not working well and um I think it's a shame now this this this uh this group is still in existence there are 501c3 they're still doing things with absolutely no support from this town and anything that they're doing is for the best interest of Fort Fairfield know why we do not want to use our resources to help them do that I cannot understand the logic behind that so I want to welcome them back into the folds before Fairfield and I want to be saying to them and when we get a chance to meet that we're here to help you to help us and uh and I'm just hoping that we can turn the page on this sort of behavior that is just so detrimental to the well-being of our community and the psychic the the emotional feeling of what it's like you'll be living in Fort Fairfield so I uh so anyway um I'm not I I am not up to speed on County Broadband I don't know how much speed I'm going to become but I want I want the town to be involved in this I I really would like to have Tim I sent Tim the report he has it Tony has agreed to work with him uh and hopefully uh through their efforts we'll be able to bring something to the council to consider uh how we can improve the quality of broadband in Fort Pierce foreign information just let you guys know what we're doing we put any uh any questions no there wasn't a lot of work went into that yeah I was a servant on the council at the early stages mid stages of that and um that is very beneficial for our community so thank you for bringing that up Dan thank you um I said another uh one of the things that our department hasn't been doing and Kevin uh has been has been very uh judicious that this is constantly looking to find grants and donations to help be able for them to run their programs and so you saw the uh the email or the memo that Kevin put together before you close to let you know that um the donation from the fort Fairfield little league for 921 to help purchase two screens for the Varsity Softball field so uh I say kudos to Kevin uh he's working with art Department as um as beneficial for the citizens that his resources will allow him so thank you for that Kevin thank you Kevin uh in Pines uh the the windshield that we have is Friday before Christmas it tore some shingles off the fines helped building I just wanted to let you know that um I contacted from a l construction they're the ones who built it he got a stop over there uh they have replaced the shingles there's been no damage inside I've contacted the insurance company uh the cost of the repairs is significantly less than our deductible which was thirteen hundred dollars was the cost and um and so we're uh we've paid that uh and it's coming out of our administrative reserves and also in conjunction with that uh provinces that is open you know Ali's back which is great and Jerry um and so thank you to Pines educari Medical Center to uh getting Health Care Providers back into Court Fairfield uh it's good to see them back there thanks yeah it is thank you [Music] um the resiliency Grant is something that um something that the injury had started and she was working with um caribou and Waterford and along with uh along with the governor's office and it has to do uh it has to do with finding ways of of dealing with climate change and how it's impacting us and Darren was a little bit involved in this so basically we received a grant of twenty thousand dollars which twenty thousand dollars was actually given to Fort Fairfield we we have it in the reserve account and thank God we have the money to back it up um and four thousand dollars of that is going to nmdc to John Oliver because they are helping administer this in actually helping us get this set up uh I had a call from John and they've got another round coming out he wants to meet with us um Tony is uh is going to be working on this as well on behalf of Fort Fairfield so we're going to continue the partnership uh I've been talking with Brian and Brett who's from the governor's office and he's pleased with the things that he's doing up here so there is going to be more money allocated to the program there'll be more money available for Fairfield caribou and Washington for our partnership Joanne's going to be getting together with us and we will be uh looking at what possible projects that we could do so for out of this particular project for fibula has eight thousand dollars and we are going to be using it to automate uh the uh foreign it's good to have knowledgeable department heads um and um and so we've got 8 000 for that um we received a quote from Mike Greenlaw to put that in and uh that will be happening sometime in the spring um hopefully before it finds out we'll see um and so I just want to give you a heads up that that we're moving forward on that and uh we've been able we're now able to disperse the funds uh the the anybody have any questions on the and the other grant that we've been working on is one that Tony and I were working on with the library is that we've had to get an extension because we ran out of time um and it's important uh it's it's uh around twenty thousand dollars and a lot of that is going to be going towards the salaries of Lynn Cody at the uh at the library and so that's going to be a big help to us as we're trying to save money uh going in so I really want to make sure that we get that the problem that we're running into is that we have to have a specific identification through the government in order to access government funds and we have to have it for the library and um and it is not a simplistic process so we're diligently working at it and thankfully Mike awesome experience was he just went through the fire department it would hold my hand and get me through this so that we can get that hit that account number and so we totally can apply for the funds because we're all set to go we just got to get that we got to get that um account number so anyway that's where we are hopefully when we together in February I can tell you that we got it and we got the money and life is good so that's where we are with that and the only other thing I have is I would like to ask Matt if uh he has some things Matt and I met with uh Terry Greenwald today uh Terry Greener Gary Greenway thank you in um you know there's some concern about what's going on with Walgreens and I asked Terry specifically if he would mind if we talked about this about our conversation in school recession so the community could hear it as well sometimes businesses before that we don't do that which I respect and he said following so I'd like to ask Matt's got a few things that he wants to talk about in relation to the police department but also about our conversation to Terry good evening um we'll talk about um the pharmacy situation first well Dan was away in Florida we got word that um going to be losing our Walgreens on February 23rd we didn't receive word at all we heard it on Facebook which is I guess where we hear everything nowadays so obviously there's some concerns um for the residents elderly especially that need prescription medications need Pharmacy items that they feel comfortable driving to Walgreens but they don't feel comfortable driving to Presque Isle or Caribou to go get those items so today um Dan and I met with Terry greenier we spoke about his business being able to assist the residents of Fort Fairfield with the prescription drug needs due to the impended closure of Walgreens Terry did State and he's equipped to pick up the Walgreens customers here in town so that way our residents do need uh do not need to go out of town they take all insurance providers so that's not an issue they deliver their prescriptions via U.S mail most of the time being delivered right here in town the next day they also have a pickup location right at their um right at the pharmacy you can walk in there's there's going to be a counter being installed soon so that that takes care of the prescription drug needs for our residents who who don't want to leave town and obviously there are all sorts of other mail-in options but we need to focus on our business in town here so this is why we're speaking about this they have a pharmacist on site during their business hours that can help people with their questions and concerns so we did speak with Terry about offering uh forward-facing merchandise such as over-the-counter medications and things of that sort Terry did say that he would like to get a feel uh for what people need so he could stock up on those items I don't think he wants to just bring a bunch of inventory in that he's going to be stuck with and I can understand as a business owner why he would want to do that um so he indicated that um they can customers can call the pharmacy if they want a special type of pain reliever or something like that they can they can reach out and they can have it have it delivered to them the next day whatever they need so um he also has a website social media that you can get information on you can contact them via the internet via phone Dan and I um were we're taking the help of some other residents taking the Walgreens issue seriously and where we're going to start engaging in conversations to to make sure that building isn't vacant for long or try to make sure that building isn't vacant for long because that that building is a hub of the community some days where I mean it's just a revolving door the parking lot is always full so you know it's just troubling to all of us so hopefully we can get something in there um that uh that will suit the needs of the community all right so I want to move to I guess my real job the police department um I'll give you a brief rundown um of what's going on or what we've been doing um some good things that have come out of the police department over the last few months uh 22 2022 was a busy year uh for the police department as we continue to deal with an increase in calls for service um during 2022 our officers handled uh 2579 total incidents these range from mental health related calls domestic violence drug issues thefts burglaries assisting the public in any way we can traffic enforcement and property checks out of the 200 or the 2579 incidents 153 cases were referred to criminal prosecution by either arrest summons or War issues it's significant for a town our size where that the officers have been busy um they've done well in solving local burglaries and I feel that our new officer signed a main drug enforcement task force has done well with gathering information on suspected drug dealers uh with the help of our Patrol officers feeding them information and intelligence that they're gathering in the community and in October of 2022 officer Cody Fenderson was obviously as the former fire chief has moved into a full-time position at the police department who has successfully able to crack open a series of burglaries with local farmers local construction companies being the victims of theft of high dollar tools because of Officer fenderson's efforts the suspect is still incarcerated and we were able to recover a large amount of tools to return the owners and Cody should be commended on that again in October 2022 officer Lance Ferguson was able to arrest the suspect who had broken into this very building in the rec center and stole a television the television was recovered and returned to the rec center and the suspect was charged with burglary and theft these are just significant cases that I'm bringing to you that are noteworthy that you know we people need to know about um let's go back to the Windstorm on December 23 2022 a severe Windstorm passed through Fort Fairfield causing numerous downed trees utility poles and power lines many residents were without powers for several days on the night of the Windstorm Fort Fairfield Public Safety departments responded to over 20 calls for downed trees power lines and utility poles in just a few hour period police officers and firefighters struggled to keep up with the calls for service as there were so many that came in at the same time with almost every major road in and out of Fort Fairfield closed due to downed trees or poles or utility wires police officers and firefighters came in on their own time to help clear the roadways of trees and debris as there were safety issues for residents and motorists I can recall at about 10 pm I was at a tree down blocking the entire Road of entire Limestone Road I called the fire department to come assist as Maine DOT was not able to respond because they were so many calls I had an ambulance pull up and three firefighters pile out of the back with a chainsaw I mean that's not something you commonly see three border patrol agents also showed up and everybody just cut branches and lugged them out of the roadways and that happened and numerous scenes that night I'd like to thank my sergeant Jesse Cormier who worked a 20-hour day that day officer Isaac whipperman was on shift that night fire chief Mike jalbert came in to help Jack Shannon Daryl Dowdy lawn Seer Rob Hendrick Andrew Lagasse Danny gehagen and Justin Crockett for their hard work and dedication during this incident and I'll be adding letters of positive performance to each one of their personnel files the following day the community center was opened by the rec director Kevin Sanel and manned by Dan Foster during the day Dan came in on a Saturday and sat there just in case somebody needed to come in and warm up because they didn't have power it's a great example of our town employees all coming together to get the job done for our citizens our community and this should be commended um these are stories that people need to hear about our employee our employees doing good things in our community anybody have any questions thank you Matt thank you thanks thank you thank you and that's all we have for uh of Correspondence and reports okay on a new business the first one is we are going to uh We've submitted a written public comment period uh policy um I had I was in Florida I had talked with Matt and he did some Google searching he sent me some stuff and from things that he sent me I put together what you have in front of you um it is it needs to be structured and people need to everybody counsel employees and Citizens need to understand what that structure is and uh it just it just meetings run better this is a business meeting in in citizens deserve you shouldn't have the right if they have a concern but this is the time they can speak to the council as a group and that is as a value opportunity and they should be allowed that um what we will be doing is that if the council approves this then uh this policy will be with the agendas so if anybody is interested in uh participating in public comment period they can pick it up really cool and they'll have it at their disposal and know how this process works um so does anybody have any questions about the policy as it's presented you want to just give these folks just a kind of so the the established Norms um are basically they're going to be that's a public comment period is going to be for up to 30 minutes um and as you know that we've had uh some uh situations where we've had a fairly large group of people and we've extended beyond that 30 minutes and that the policy allows that within regardless regarding whatever the issue is that if the Town Council feels that more time should be given that they can pick a phone and do that and so that so it can be extended Beyond 30 minutes different Council believes that it should be um it is expected that the norm of the presentation will be of the same professional manner that the council addresses each other and uh in department has that that will be uh um uh I just would be expected also what's really important is that this is not supposed to be a period of Engagement it's supposed to be a period of sharing and um if somebody has questions that they want to have answered then that's my responsibility and that is something that can be taken up at a time other than the business meeting and that is something that uh I I should do should want to do and and I would encourage that anybody who has a concern about what's going on the town call me come into the office connect it's what you need to do but we will not be engaging at a meeting uh that's not the purpose of the meeting so uh that is an important part of this because we all everybody has a problem uh with with uh with that particular issue so that that's really important uh and the other thing is is that final comment period will not be conducted at workshops emergency meetings or special meetings that we'll be using in that just a regular scheduled meetings uh and that each individual wishing to speak uh will say what they have to say within a time limit of three minutes and as the discretion of the council chair that can be extended dependent upon what the particular issue is so that's basically the basics of the written policy any other questions for today in regarding the public comment period policy no okay look for motion to approve that I'm checking it yeah most in second any further discussion questions anything okay go to vote Pat hi Kevin hi Jim hi Bob hi and I vote right thank you um and then the uh the other thing I have under new business is uh Randy Martin has been um working pretty darn hard as the um is that his title I think that's what he's called yeah this is at the central arusic County Soil and Water Conservation District and uh he contacted me uh they're putting together a technical advisory committee on the lower acoustic River Watershed and he really wanted somebody from Fort Fairfield to be involved in that so I talked to Tony Tony has some knowledge in this he is that he's worked on this before he and Tony has agreed to do it and I would like you to prove that appointment uh but also I'd like totally maybe you share a little bit about what this is about the project that they're proposal is what they're going to call the lower stick and very similar to what happened around the preschool in the 90s series of surveys are done with the Growers Upstream you need to identify the sources or resources whichever it may be the sources of the problems causing either erosion or contamination of the soils or whatever it might be or sources of funds that they might use to alleviate the issues and that went for quite a quite a long time she had press yield cleaned up they had to start it I believe Josephine went all the way to Canada through Easton and through Mars Hill and through I think it's a plantation a long time in a lot of meetings I was fortunate enough to attend those meetings with representative St John rooster guard CMD and whoever our executive directors were at the time I believe that they have removed a certain amount of solemn blight I don't think it's a perfect situation I don't think there's anything we can do in environmental situations to make them perfect they have identified at least two sources of funds and some of those would be pep funds are called 319 funds and they've then identified some USDA funds or equipped funds to help with the producers so that they can better use conservation practices around their farms and with the old falls are the non-point Source uh so it's cool I'm pollutants one on point source pollutants uh I think I know that there are four Outlets that they're going to address first and one of them is what I'm going to call Parker siding the next one is going to be the gray road which is over the Strickland Road the gray uh stream the yamsden brook and then hacker broke and a few years ago during and his crew were involved with some research on solutions to what was happening at anthon Brook and that was through I believe Scott Bellaire at the EP there may be a whole file already started that can cut this time frame in half and I'm going to mention that the very first meeting that I go to that there are other people that should get this table that can help you solve your problem they have experience and they may even have those materials and that's that's it in that show going forward whether we participate or not and I think that by being at the table I can at least shortcut some of the programs projects but the three of them are in Fort Fairfield they're all falls in Fort Fairfield OH so where's where's this concern or what's his why is it for the lower four Fairfield Watershed like what well I think there's been an identification of a phosphorus problem okay so it's adding to the pollution which couldn't

your name and approach to your podium my name is Emma Evergreen and I am here in support of the rec department thank you [Music] thank Cambria butchers and I am here in Florida Rec Department s like going to affect my family and Future Kids of this town thank you my name is Stephanie Schlesinger and I'm here in support of the rec department and our future kids here thank you I am a Shelby Everett and I'm here this is for the rec department I feel like that is pretty much all we have left for them so I'm asking them not to take it thank you my name is Ryan Cormier I'm here in support of the rec department uh I'd just like to say I would suggest um if possible rethinking the idea of slashing the direct Department budget um as we all know our tax base is based on individuals owning property in this community if this community is to survive and not turn into a limestone a Washburn a day of urine we need to you need to have families come into this community and without a Rec Department it makes it very unlikely certainly with that lab so that kills our tax base obviously we have apparently under we've Apparently overspent that is a problem but I think it's rather short-sighted to look at the rec department as a solution to QR code I think you will indirectly over time not a long time affect our school system as well as our tax base I would just help you keep that in mind before anything further to look forward to occur thank you Ryan foreign thank you my name is Nathan Everett um I would like to say that if we no before I say anything I know I'm only 17 and I'm still in the school system but we do I feel that there should still be a record time we they just got new equipment fairly recently I mean before we do anything to the budget I feel we should rethinks and things thank you thank you my name is Country and sorry my voice love the right person I went to school here I grew up here this wreck doesn't only save these kids it keeps off the street without it what are these other kids can have thank you thank you good afternoon my name is Doug flesinger I have three boys for about three years now live in a very small town um I've seen what happens to Toms that you get rid of the right Department if the kids don't have something to do they look into other things which aren't getting in trouble getting into drugs I don't really think that's something that we really need in this topic so I support the right Department Mary St Thomas and I was doing here so I really hope you guys think twice before you end up slashing this and cut this program thank you thank you my name is Angela Cormier I sent a letter today and I hope that you had a chance to read it but I just wanted to reiterate um I really hope that we consider um in our budget cuts that we think about our youth and they're emotional as well as physical well-being I think that we've seen overcova shutdowns that the amount of anxiety depression mental health problems have skyrocketed and without this rec department and all the activities that it provides and that Kevin organizes for our kids I'm concerned about the future of our kids in this community as well as others but my primary focus is here so I hope that you really do all that you can to preserve what we have thank you my grown kids lived in the rec room and my grandson is 14. he loves the rec program we get socialization there he has improved his basketball skills there the programs that Kevin has are wonderful it gave him something to do during school vacations and I hope you take this into consideration the kids don't have much to do in this town as it is now and I feel if you shut down threat programs they're going to turn to other things and traveling to the Presque Isle is not really an option for a lot of us to get a kid to a rec department they need this life Department thank you Arlene school year and uh Mapleton I know has a wreck and Pascal does but we still prefer to come over here for Mr Kevin and then the kids and the community so and it would be detrimental to our kids if we didn't have it good thank you okay my name is Tammy Sierra and I just I'm so bored that both of my kids are both grown but they lived at this rep they were here every day playing anything that they could do with this wreck and thanks to Mr Tom um it was just something they enjoyed to do every day and now we have a seven-year-old that we're getting ready to adopt and without Mr Kevin she he makes it fun for him so it gives her something to do I'm fully in support thank you damn foreign thank you for taking the time to come 17 years old and all and thank you for speaking to us the responsibility of a young adult and it's nice to hear um I understand your concerns and I guess the thing that what I want to say to you is of course um you know Kevin and I have been Kevin and I have been talking about this and one of my comments to Kevin was is that I have Parks and Rec on essential service but it's more than such a service than most people give their credit for and you know it's not just your kids a good advantage of the right Department because mine did his wife and my youngest was here a lot and really enjoyed the programs it's not our intent to shut down or even dramatically decrease the wreck department or the services that it provides what I'm trying to do is I have two objectives I gotta find four hundred thousand dollars minimum in this budget now I gotta find I gotta pay off a loan that I don't have any money budgeted for you guys saw your property taxes you saw what they were 36 increase and I've got 1 million 275 000 worth of loans that are due this year that don't have a single cent in that budget allocated for it it's not this is not just the rec department but it's every Department the thing that I look at when I go to it when I go to an apartment here like I went to with Kevin and and said to him I look at where they were and where they're going so I could understand your concern if your budget two years ago was 150 000 and I'm telling Kevin you need to take forty thousand dollars out of that budget that's not what happened what's happened is that two years ago your budget was 158 000. do you know how much money the rec department actually sped two years ago out of that 158 000. 112. now nobody two years ago was complaining about the quality of service they were receiving so they spent a hundred and twelve thousand dollars two years ago this past year they increased the budget to 180 000. and this year they increased the budget to three hundred thousand two hundred and ninety six thousand dollars that's almost three times what was spent two years ago you know listen we're a small town and you cannot take a create a large government to create a large Town what you create is a small town going broke and that's what we are so this is not just on the rec department it's certainly is not on Kevin and Doug who provide great quality service as you can say to people who are really uh really come on the service I understand it what we're looking at doing is reducing the amount of increase so that we can get the money that we need and it's coming out of every Department but what I asked Kevin was I say Kevin I look at your budget you've been through the summer uh which is the most expensive part of the Year we're into the winter I need you to find fifty thousand dollars in your budget if he's able to find fifty thousand dollars in his budget that means his budget is still going to be seventy thousand dollars more than what was budgeted last year I mean we're not we're not killing the rec department all we're doing is trying to bring down the Deep break down the increase to something that is somewhat halfway reasonable as far as next year is concerned let me finish please as far as next year is concerned I don't get a vote all I can do is I can go to the budget advisory committee and I can go to the council and and Kevin and I departmental manager are going to work on a budget it may not be where he wants to be but we're going to work out a budget and we're going to take it to them take it to the council say this is where we are Evan's going to say if we do this and this is what we lose the council decides whether or not that's reasonable so that's the decision that's been made now nor do I have to pretend that it's been made but we need to find we need to find some significant savings every department has got to has to be part of that process I've asked Kevin to be part of that process that has absolutely nothing to do but taken away from the value that the right Department brings to this community what it is doing is that it is reducing the the huge increase that was given to this uh Department over two years so that is that is where we're at that is where my mindset is that's what we're trying to accomplish so please don't think that we're cutting your your budget down to nothing and that they're going to close the doors there's nothing like that my hope is is that Kevin's going to be able to do this and he and Douglas be able to continue to provide the surface and Kevin does an amazing job I don't know if you saw the Christmas light parade uh in the in the part of the head of the gym Kevin is a great organizer and he's great with the kids so I want to support him I want to support the department we've got to keep the town solvent we're all going to share in the pain that in order to be able to do that I just want you guys to understand what the methodology is of a thought process so thank you I appreciate you coming I appreciate your concerns you can be short I don't take them lightly uh and the other thing I'd like to say too is that I am more than willing to meet with anybody anytime you just need to call me make an appointment I'd be happy to sit down with you and we can talk about what the issues are and what your concerns are what your hopes are I am more than willing and would love for you to sit down and talk with any citizen who has any interest at all in what's going on in town government you folks need to be involved because we cannot afford to have this situation happen again thank you thank you Dan um before we continue I just don't want to skip um did you want to speak first yeah I just would like to my name is Kaiser Rochford lifelong resident in Fort Fairfield I just would like you all to keep in mind too that I don't necessarily think that the spending in 2020 is a fair reflection of the department and what it's capable of especially since Kevin came in just before the pandemic and made much needed improvements brought us some new equipment um brought in some new programs all these different things I don't think that is a fair reflection of of the department okay so yeah I was going to touch on that as well as the the you know two years ago can't really compare to now because we're in a different world then so definitely can't look at those two numbers at all but the rec department that's been what it has been built up to become can very easily revert back to you know years ago like yes we've always had a great Rec Department I grew up in it um my child grew up in it both of my kids grew up in it so I understand we've always been very fortunate we've always had a really good Rec Department however what our rec department has grown to these past few years is because we have put the money in it that it needed um you know we were way behind a lot of other communities with our rec department just because we didn't have the funds put into it in years past then we finally started putting money into it new programs were introduced new staff was hired there are a lot of things and now if we start cutting this budget it's going to go right back to where it was so fifty thousand dollars is a big difference between what's already budgeted for already approved so I'm just not sure how a fifty thousand dollar cut to the budget can just be done without being brought to the council that's my concern is that yes the budget was approved I understand we need to make Cuts I'm not saying in any way shape or form that we don't need to make Cuts I agree with that and I think you're doing a really good job but I think that if there are large cuts to that amount they need to come before the council to be approved it shouldn't just be this is a budget that the council approved but now you can do whatever you want with it and I'm not saying that to be offensive I'm just that's how I feel and you know I think that those things need to be brought before the council obviously their support of the community they're here tonight they don't want to see the wreck budget cut I definitely don't want to see the wrecked budget cut and I don't know if any of the other counselors would but it was never asked we never got asked but we're the governing body of our town we have the final say so that's how it should be um again this is my last hurray but I'm gonna go out with a bang like the council should have a say in the budget cuts well we we will but we're not fifty thousand dollars well yeah but it hasn't been approved yet but it's cut they're cutting well they're they're they're they're they're asking to show a cot okay so I make a motion that we do not make any cuts to the rec department budget at the time and place that is possible but it is impossible tonight okay so then why is it possible that we can just make Cuts well we've got all our department heads are going to end up coming up with different numbers for every budget so who has to determine whether or not that's approved before it's done when it's budget time but this budget was already approved so now if we're cutting then that you can't just cut without making an approval like fine but we got different town manager now too the council is being circumvented so you're basically blowing up your own form of government well no you're not using we as a counselor are going to have the last say but you're not but that we are yeah that's that's yeah you're not everybody not just the people the people scoring our athletic department we all are in favor of our South State Department but we're very part of what Kevin has done we all we all are uh I don't think this is as bad as it sounds to a lot of people there I think what Dan's trying to do we're getting in as our intern manager and he's going to plan to get our taxes down to where people are I'm gonna afford to pay their taxes but at what cost at the cost of our kids don't worry but for now we need to make these move these steps to get our taxes down that's the bottom line but our youth in this community Kevin can't afford to have any less than they already do our youth in this community our kids in this community cannot afford to have less than they do I mean I know a lot of people don't have young kids but guess what that do you want them out walking up and down Main Street instead of at the rec center if they don't have anywhere to go they're going to find something else to do well the reason our taxes are where they are right now is because of the previous County Council this time and we're not going to be able to fix it in a year or two we're not if we didn't get this way in a year or two we can't fix it in a year or two we can't just take an ax and chop everything down we have to find out what things are important to our citizens and what to keep and what to cut that's what's going on right now well I mean it comes at a pretty high cost if it's coming at the cost of our kids I'm thinking there's other things we can cut listen let me tell you something I live in Fort Fairfield and that cost me over 500 a month to live in my own home because you're just on my taxes alone yeah I I agree that we need to make Cuts I just don't think it should be our rec department like I said it didn't take us a couple years to get into the situation so it's not gonna we're not going to get out of it overnight we have to look at things and evaluate things and that's what we're doing yeah I mean right now tonight there's no decisions being made it it has been able to help you out right right I I love to see the concern and and I still want the athletic department yeah that's the bottom line I mean I think I think there's I think there's more ways to come up with a workable system that nobody suffers any sacrifices in the system that they have right today and we can make it work and and still see enough Cuts here and there to make our whole Community as a whole not suffer for any Services uh but it's it's it's not going to happen tonight of course and uh at this time we'll we'll have our chance to vote in on the budget and and make it work and and I feel same as you I'm I'm a big supporter of of our departments but you say it's not going to happen tonight Bob it's already happening we're already being asked to cut fifty thousand dollars from your budget well it it is and and as as shown when was the when were they asked to cut how long ago 100 or 75 000. our our calendar year runs from July so what we're looking at we're halfway through here in the doctor Department fifty thousand dollars do you know what the customer being in the fire department I understand that there are places we're going to have to cut I get that I'm not saying that I'm saying 50 000 my Department's gonna be probably closer to 300. I mean they probably had a lot more that they could cut I don't know I don't know every budget I mean I do I guess no every budget I do um I shouldn't say I don't because of part of it but so Melissa every year I mean we have a budget and the whole idea behind the budget from my perspective of account managers that it's the amount that you do not go over and and what our goal is is to try to get to try to stay under that budget right and that's what we constantly do the issue today is is that we have to stay under our budget well you have to stay under our budget by a significant amount because we got this debt that we have to pay and there's so many budget to pay it right I understand that okay so I mean it's not but we don't have to ask Health permission to try to save money okay but in order to say you have to save fifty thousand dollars stuff has to go away I'm asking him just like I'm talking to Mike every day and I'm talking to Darren and I'm talking to Matt you know talking about the library for God's sakes do we have is it open anymore I mean it's one thing that we've got our community Librarians who are doing a great job with all due respect I do not feel that whatever occurred for the town to become in debt I do not know what series of events led to that I do not feel that the burden of those decisions should be placed on the youth in the kids in this town well at this time and I will say I don't think we're going to be looking at Our Youth Department and our community suffering in any way whatever whatever there is for Budget cuttings it will not affect the kids all the services that they're having will be had they'll have uh they'll have no reflection on any services that they're providing for this do you know that you know that for sure well I I say that because I recall five six years ago the same services and I know inflation has changed it has but I know at one time what the services cost our town and they had the same amount of services in it and it was about a third of what it cost today there's a there's there's there's other ways to save that 50 000 and not in the programs the programs isn't costing any more for for three or five there's other ways that they can as as a whole on budgets to save money and and I mean we could go on on this all night we could my my input on it is I I don't want to see any Services suffer in our rec department I want to see everybody use the rec department as it was intended for and and move forward that's that's my goal I'd like to hear from Kevin to see how the budget would directly impact the program well I'll tell you at this time um Kevin if you'd like I'll if that's okay with you would you like to reflect on that all right so the requested budget cuts were from uh our wages line and that would be directly thirty thousand dollars from additional support wages so it may not have a direct impact um I haven't looked at it yet as far as if I'm going to be losing any programs but it will definitely have an impact on the quality of the program so for example if we have a program with 36 kids in it like some other basketball currently has vertices I've been a program of 36 kids we try to have at least one person for every 12 people um that way if it's a sports program especially it's easier to get one-on-one attention um if we have less people at the program working at then obviously that will be less than one-on-one time so the quality of the program may suffer time staff have are usually school kids correct so that would be a loss of employment for those kids who can usually only work after school because they're usually athletes or you know they can't work a regular full-time job because they're students yes okay so there is something that I would like to mention on the jobs part of it I actually myself have been looking for a job preferably within town for quite a while now and I can say it is kind of hard to find a part-time job anywhere really I mean we've had a lot of businesses close temporarily or permanently like wherever Zedge is going permanently I believe at the end of this coming summer Boondocks is closed for a bit and they've just reopened but last I heard they had a covet outbreak so they had a temporary close again um I know it's been hard to get openings for other places in town like Walgreens because they don't like have the need for it but if we had more businesses in town or even more opportunities for some form of work that would actually be very great because I know at least for myself it's very hard to find a job so a lot of people are looking outside of town if they can but for some of us it's not possible like myself because I don't have my license yet I don't have a car because I haven't been able to get the money saved up to do so because I haven't really had a job and it really is hard on a lot of us especially when we have families like when I live and where we're kind of going paycheck to paycheck budgeting as best we can to keep fueling the tank for the furnace and fueling the cars keep food on the counters and everything it really is hard yeah I know mom's been having to go to the food bank every now and then we'll when we're short on money because a lot of things happen like fairly recently uh on November 3rd we lost one of our dogs and because we had to put her down she couldn't see but we had to take money out of our normal budget to pay for that and then about a week later one of our other dogs Daisy she was only 10. she passed away probably because mine was gone and they were like best friends and well that kind of took a lot of money out of our budget because we had to get her cremated it's fun well I also got cremated but that was yeah the point is it takes a lot of money out of our budgets and some parents can't afford to always assist their kids with drivers ed and everything I mean we used to have a free jump on the program in the school Mr McRae worked there but since he's retired we don't have that Megan was there but that's gone and now everybody has to go pay for driver's ed it makes it hard on us to get our license and especially with a pandemic it's been hard to get cars because everybody's trying to get money where they can well I thank you yeah yeah thank you very much uh if there's okay thank you foreign say another thing there is well we're just checking to see if anybody else yes that seems like a large proportion of the rest budget I'm just curious if the percentage over the last two or three years the services that are being provided uh so in um um probably uh we're going to be looking at scary share aware now what's not going to get up the street tonight I think the rec department does support a job and it's evident by the number of children here tonight and they like Kevin they like his programs and I called you for that but gotta go back and when the last budget was approved three of your people were on that budget on the council and you approved a budget that was not sustainable I've tried to tell you that then and I'm trying to tell you again you cannot sustain a budget when you overstanding all the time it's got to come from somewhere the rec department as evidenced by the number of children here tonight it's well liked appreciate it and I applaud that I applaud that not that I necessarily approve of what how Kevin runs in his Department nor do I approve how the ambulance department is running nor do I approve how the highway department is run that's his job to manage the department heads to get the job done your job is to stay Within a certain amount of money so that we as taxpayers don't have 36 increases every year we can't sustain that you can't do it so you can point the finger all you want to a former time management but there's enough blame to go around I think for those that serve in those capacities I honestly don't think you guys did a good job analyzing what was being presented to you maybe you didn't have all the facts you didn't have all the figures but you should have you should ask the questions how the hell are we going to pay for it how are we going to pay for it Dan came into the picture here he's got a tough job to do and I Applause I do too it's not an easy job to make cuts to reduce budgets to do what has to be done but if you look out for the population the taxpayers I applaud him I think he's going to hold a drone so we can we can stand here tonight and talk about direct Department we stood last week last month talked about the library Department again it's been doing a good job with Mike on a Fire EMS Department so everybody's got to give everybody's going to give every department has to give the percentages may not be equal it may not be equal but we have to pay our bills we got a lot of money that we owe it's got to come from somewhere so every every dollar that each department saves this year a little louder to make some payments if we don't pay it this year gonna pay it next year and the year after that I don't want to see my taxes go up another 30 next year I don't know so it's up to become Council to support the recommendations of the manager who has a good picture of the whole the whole watch bottle wax what's going on so God said don't get me wrong I support the rec department I think that I think they're they're good for the kids and I agree if you didn't have that Rec Department there the kids would go on the street they'd be doing something else we don't want that but somehow we got to save some money and Kevin's going to work with Dan to come up with the savings and whatever it is he has has to have so thank you for your time thank you Gary yep thank you Gary we're not asking to not have cuts at all it's just to not cut so much that the programs suffer that's it that's all that people want is they want to not have the rec department cut down from what it's been built up to become yeah so there has to be a reasonable amount that can be cut and still provide the services that's all that people want is to have the same level of services that they have in the rec department so can I say something else uh we have got to try to move this along if any other buddies got anything to add to public comment period um you can but you don't have to be quick okay told me about that when he was around my age there used to be a lot more to do in the town and I know things have changed but yeah you may have an idea as to how we might be able to get some money to help I know it may sound a little farfetched but maybe doing like a fundraiser or a couple so I just want to interject what I would say is you have awesome ideas I would come in and talk to our town manager during um like the during the week and go over some of those ideas I think that would be probably the best time that way he can kind of get all the information I think that would be probably your best bet yeah thank you thank you yep uh if anybody else has anything to add if not uh we'll move the license and then permit okay licenses information next we'll go to financial report [Music] s foreign um our income is uh has been a pretty straightforward I've been sharing this up a little bit uh AMS has been great uh they were at thirty four thousand five hundred dollars last left which is a little bit higher than what it has been they are definitely on track uh to doing four hundred thousand dollars a year uh which is uh which is good they're doing a great job with the buildings and they're and they're keeping busy um our property tax collections uh drop drastically from where we had been we only received under 67 000 but uh we were able to say current with our accounts payable the school is up to date and I can tell you that uh today uh yesterday we sent a check to the school we actually made their payment on time for the first time since and so I was really happy about that and we still have some money left on our line of credit if we haven't drawn down uh so that's so that's great uh so all in all I think financially uh for this year I mean the Departments are doing well we've had a very mild winter and that has been great for public works and so hopefully that'll keep keep going I think Darren has really been doing some interesting stuff with the 110s that has that I think is going to save us a lot of money and I'm really pleased with that has any questions I'll name it financial information expenses okay uh stealing our strengthening Atlanta meeting was the day after our last country as it means about cobra a net reading side that we're about six percent ahead of budget so we're doing pretty well this year in our budgets we also passed our budget for 2023 while we were there there aren't going to be some cost of living increases the cost of living about eight percent straight across the board for our contracted customers I think we're going to be seeing about that much of an increase the owners are seeing much later much later in peace in as part of our Temperance vehicles in that to stay on track but they were able to pass a budget it was going to absorb everything we need to have and because we don't know where energy is going to be and energy is good impact on our budget this year electricity costs are going up again propane costs are very high so they're working very hard which is um we're working with the dep and a couple of new programs that are coming out where we're always chasing down a few fast problems that are going on um told me today that uh that EPA at the federal level is proposing to have a lot of money to help to do small recycling so he's right on top of that he's working with the EPA today with the dep representative so that to make sure that our landfill gets this year with the funding just moved on the fight for that so I'm pretty pleased about that we had a fire at the landfill this week at 25 feet deep in the landfill ing fire we had phenomenal help from the footage of white department and both my his director and life as our price Chief are working together to get us some better equipment out there so that we can contain some of that stuff before we have to call the fire department Mark asked Eric has gone to the counselors and to whom we're bringing public Hospital service they don't really know the cause of this particular fire because it was so deep in the in the landfill but the other pricing we've had this year of All Because by batteries we have a collection point it doesn't cost you anything to have your cell phones dropped up at the gate you should come in or powerful batteries or laptops my last two thighs that we found batteries cost for a phone a cell phone and a laptop so we're just asking people again to it doesn't cost you anything other than the time to pass it to the person in the gate and they'll take care of it from you and I think that we're working with Mike to possibly set up a question Point here at the fire station as well to try to preclude any of those from happening uh we appreciated the help of the Town fire department it's a lot of work to get stuff up rolling up on top of the hill and then it smelled her out and then keep an eye on it and uh they were great help we really appreciate that um that's about all we can if there's any other questions or anything we'll be glad to answer thank you thank you Steve Merry Christmas Michael good evening guys thank you our call volume for November was 46 EMS calls and four fire calls some good news too we've got four new volunteer firemen since the last time we met so now we're up to 17 volunteer firemen I've come up a long way from the one or two that we had before so we're making progress there um there's been a lot going on as Mr rajeski said we spent a lot of time last week working with the landfill to help them with their fire I think we were there uh five days last week and we've got some ways that we're going to be able to work together with the landfill to make things better in the future some of the things recently that we've done to help reduce costs and help eliminate debt as you guys will vote on later there's a sale of an ambulance to town and Van Buren by doing that it pays the loan off for the ambulance and um makes it so the this way you're the one keeping one of them will Own It Free and Clear and it gets that payment gone um on the other side of that uh we still need a second ambulance so I've been working on acquiring an ambulance and one way that I've been able to do that is with our Surplus equipment that we have we have a brush truck that we are able to put towards a used ambulance and by using that Surplus equipment we can acquire that ambulance at zero cost to the town so now we would have two ambulances again and zero debt to both of those ambulances so that'll help help things out drastically um there has been we're not looking to I guess I'm having a hard time to um there's been some issues brought to our attention about about this second ambulance that we're looking uh use one that we're getting looking to get and like people bringing up these issues it helps us make an informed decision as it is a whole group so this way yeah and uh there was an issue with the motor itself as a whole there was a problem in that that Ford engine and by us somebody bringing the issue up and US looking into it we found out that it's actually been resolved and it's a really really good Ambulance with 6 000 miles on it on every building engine it's a pretty good deal for us because we're working as a group to look through things like this um another thing that we've done is between me and the police department we have uh sold two of the SUVs as well um to help bring us down I am still working on selling the ladder truck it's a very expensive piece piece of equipment it's a very hard piece of equipment to sell as well that I just want everybody to know that we've been getting inquiries regularly on it um as soon as we have something that's viable you know I'll definitely agreement to the board but we've been getting some hits we are trying to to sell that to help costs thank you lately I've also attended numerous workshops with aristoc EMA on the Emergency Management side of things for the town and I'm taking many workshops on FEMA for Grants we're going to be looking at every Grant possibility we can here in the early spring I also wanted to mention that uh Prescott fire department and nmcc they had put in for a grant for training for EMTs for the county and they are putting scholarships together for 30 EMTs for the entire County they're doing a school down in Holton for 10 EMTs doing one in Presque Isle for 1080s and 10 up in Fort Kent free of charge and of those 10 30 students 10 of those are going to have a free scholarship for their paramedicine degree to become a paramedic to help their communities I have been selected I will be attending free of charge the empty basic course in January but we're looking at every possibility where we can save that's all I have I just like to add one thing um I've been pretty I almost happened let's just have to implicitly persistent um one of the concerns that I have is the model that we have is full-time full-time employees for the antique and because every dollar that we spend on a full-time employee within 46 cents on benefits uh Mike is very adamant that he needs his seven full-time employees which is four or less than what was budgeted for but what one of the things one of the reasons why getting the second answer is so important to Mike is that there are many times that second ambulance can go up and one of the things that Mike has been doing is that he has been diligently working not just on volunteer firefighters but getting on call and part-time folks for ents and in paramedics and by doing that we can get someone other than a full-time person in overtime to run that second ambulance and we can make money doing that the costs are low enough so that we could actually make money so what Mike is looking at not so much as reducing our costs but increasing our income and that is a that's a that's a it's a very thoughtful uh creative problem-solving way at trying to figure out how we can run an ambulance service and and try to break even so I'd say my hat's off to Mike I mean I think he's doing a great job he's got a lot of balls in the air he's very thoughtful he works really hard and uh he's well respected by his peers so I just want to throw that out there I think he's doing a great job good job thank you we appreciate everything you're doing Matt uh engineers said we need to have a little positive spirit in this town and I want to do a luxury and I'm expecting maybe six to eight we might be able to get six or eight or ten floats uh and Kevin is willing to open up the gym and we're gonna get Buck chocolate and cookies and Santa Claus and a tree lighting ceremony well they had 32 injuries wow wow they had a main street was packed my mother wanted to go she had Johnny take her down there she's always better than the festival party it that honestly Matt and Kevin just did an upstanding job organizing that putting it on people had a wonderful time that streets are packed with the grandparents and parents and kids I mean you know it just did your hard good to see it so we really do have some good people here and they are working in our community and uh I I just I was really impressed with that whole thing yeah yeah nice job um you have uh the memo that I sent out to you at a a approved format in Mike to solve their Surplus SUVs they sold two for eighty five hundred dollars and went for 5200 all that money's gone into the reserve account and as I said with the ambulance Soul we are now down to Chevy pickup although that's going to be going uh folks who approve the uh the second ambulance and we just hit the ladder truck so that's that's that is I think the guys have been working really yeah such a big accomplishment yes it's great um I want to let you know that uh you know God loves Cheryl she's back at it she's um going to be running the festival again which I couldn't have been happier to hear that uh but she applied for a grant and she applied for a ten thousand dollar Grant to uh Department of victim of community development through their tourism department and she got it and she got ten thousand dollars for marketing she's gonna completely uh redo the website and get some brochures she's got she's got all kinds of stuff that she's going to be doing good for the festival so I say hats off to uh hats off to Cheryl yeah so I want to let you know about that um I gave you some uh uh memos that Kevin uh prepared for you folks for uh the recreation of the recreation WalMart Grant award in fact you were putting some of those so you got a 2500 Grant uh receives an onus donation um for a video program for the rec center uh to hopefully stop people from breaking in and stealing stuff um the you see the um the level that he put together for the community support for the our holiday event and as you can see a lot of communities are more than willing to a lot of businesses but more than willing to participate businesses School organizations individuals it was a great coming together of the community and received a gift card an Amazon gift card for the Department from Chris Murchison so Kevin's been busy thank you Kevin and that is all I have under reports so uh we'll move on to new business um uh we have a vacancy on the library Advisory Board I gave you folks the application from Elizabeth Lee I'll have you know that Elizabeth is uh very involved with social media and our two part-time Librarians were struggling a little bit with their website uh with their Facebook page Elizabeth went down it's working with them to get that up and going uh so she we've done it on the job already so I would highly recommend Elizabeth Reed to replace the vacancy on the library advisory so move second kind of motion in a second all in favor say aye aye um I had already talked to you folks about this or emailed you through this um but I do I'm going to have it on the record that the council approve to sell the annuals to the town of Van Buren we received 150 000 uh that was applied against the loan we have one we have a payment that we make in June and we will have um a partial payment or a payment might be a little bit more but it will be paid off so that will not be part of our budget for next year so sixty thousand dollars so I would ask I also to approve that sale because a second had a motion I had a motion in a second all in favor say aye aye [Music] um we did uh Mitch introduced the ordinance uh for Kate help and we had a public hearing I think I talked with her Courier he's in the process of bringing the purchase a sales agreement uh I haven't

elected to Town Council okay anybody have anything to add on public comment period tonight I'd like to congratulate Matt cousins for his Awards of presidential Valor award I don't know what he is to the one now but I understand that when you get something like that you really deserve it thank you [Applause] Carolyn yes tonight please yes did the counselors all have copyright reports not sure how many citizens have seen it I'll take just a minute to look at some of the highlights my perspective I've taken the time to review this audit report there's some things that really did surprise me because we've been looking at them for the last year and a half a lot of people probably did realize it next position down 836 thousand dollars well done change in the net position in two years one million eight hundred seventeen thousand yes billion 8 17. if that's not alarming I'm not sure what is that position changed last year 836 thousand dollars foreign funds balance damn 575 thousand dollars excessive expenses over Revenue last year seven hundred and ninety thousand dollars the last thing I want to point out those of you that have a chance to look at this will see this I was really surprised benefits employees covered payroll covered employee payroll 2019 was 546 thousand dollars 2021 811 thousand dollars last year a million 101. that's reflected in the other numbers but that's just the employee payroll it's an increase of 555 000 week two years most of you that don't have a hard copy can go online and get a the same information it will be on our website tomorrow because we'll be approving it tonight and we will be putting it on the website tomorrow I wasn't surprised by the numbers because I've been standing here for quite some time talking to the council about concerns I had about overspending concerned I had about increasing taxes that most citizens should have those concerns this this report it's from the Auditors and it just verifies what some of us have been saying right along and I'm not sure I'll be honest with you I hate to say this and I'm not sure whether counsel is then the last two or three years knowing some of this stuff was going on continuing to approve budgets That Way Beyond reasonable number the numbers speak for themselves and hopefully hopefully the council manager will take the corrective action to bring this back in line thank you for your time thank you Gary anybody else if not uh oh no come on yeah okay I just I don't know what's happening on the librarian side but I want to speak on her behalf and uh she doesn't know this but I'm not I don't know her personally as a friend or anything but I have been tutoring at the library often on the past and I saw what an amazing job she's been doing uh creating archives and stuff and I'm hoping this has been resolved tonight because I really think you know I hope this it has that we talk about it tonight but I've just been really impressed by this lady and I know that there is reducing hours and stuff is happening but sometimes it has unintended consequences for the town because the library is a central part of the town and it's another door that's closed in our town which is almost empty anyway and um she's been a woman that's researched the history of the town in the library and she's also created The Archives that's available it's really a valuable piece of stuff in that room and she spent eight years doing that that stuff was down in the cellar originally and that's what I found out during that year and a half I was tutoring and I just I think I started just asking her about Joan of Arc is it Joan of Arc yes the statue because I you know I I grew up in this town I've been here 74 years I love this town I lived on Main Street my grandparents had the Sierra restaurant from Canada they came over and back then there was 6 000 people and it was a very thriving community and I've seen it in Decline over the years but I still love this community and I love that library that Carnegie Library that is so special and I know in other towns they've kind of attacked the library in Limestone several several times and it still came up thriving and they're still alive with a librarian that can work in the library and is passionate about maintaining the history and the Integrity of that library and the number of people that rely on that Library are in a town that is older and um just like a bedroom community and the children that came in that are homeschooled during the day and the kids after school and and I think even homeless people go in there and I just wanted to talk about that just for a minute because the Andrew Carnegie thing I'm sure this thing only cost I don't even know the history but I'll go on a fake one right now most of them were about five thousand dollars they're around 1918 that some of them did it and then you just did matching funds and everything and it's just a non-believable uh library and I'm glad that she saved Joan of Arc because it was disintegrating because of the material on that thing and and she put it in a very special spot so no one could put their hands on it again because it was a lot of damage done over the years and there's been a lot of work done inside but it's just a an unusually pretty library and I use it and for tutoring and she went above and beyond the Call of Duty to make sure that my student who was special needs um high schooler had silence and she moved things I didn't even ask she just moved the movie stuff because there was noise and like the little the girl that I was working with just couldn't tolerate so we left but she the next morning it was it was quiet again and uh you know it just it just was wonderful to see said such a dedicated woman and I know people who have their odds against people and things happen but the best thing to do when you do that is to go back to the person and work it out because that's what life is in Fort Pierce was very friendly friendly town and you know and all I know all of you and you're all special people to me and it's a hard job to be up there and do what you've been doing and um and yes we are in a hardship but I I'm sure we're going to get out of this there's going to by God's mercy this town will Thrive again you know and we'll turn it around you know and but basically I I the stuff that goes on is not books Just Books you know that there's just enormous internet stuff and possibilities and technology and research and just essential services for the older people and not only that my sister's been homebound for a while and even though the people from the library know every book that she might want and they would even deliver it to her come on that's a wonderful service to our County it's a social service I mean and you know just the people she's hired or has on in in the library are exceptional people that are very caring and compassionate it's and um I I don't um I think we always need a leader in the library that's passionate like that we can never get rid of the librarian in this town really and I don't want other towns to come in and take over either I think it's a personal thing and I bet most of you agree with that that it is personal that the library is a very important part of our history of town and it's a safe place for many people like the student I had she learned to love that Library you know she she wouldn't have gone and she wouldn't have gone out she was an isolated girl and she actually enjoyed it and it was a social moment for her too to see other people coming in and enjoying their Library as much as I I love the library so I grew up in a library and I went to college and worked in the library so and it is not an easy job and and I'm sure it's not it's not going to hurt to even maintain what you already have because it's only I I guess according to the journal it's one to two percent of the budget I don't always think it's one but anyway because I think she saved enormous amount of money since she's been in here because she's very computer wise and Technology wise and fixes things herself and um she's a multitask person and a woman that I'm impressed with and I know that it costs money to maintain it but I see the importance of her being there she's a good leader she's I think she's dedicated eight years passionately and that's what we need we need passion and people in town and we need them to stay here and I don't know if I have other comments here but um she's also well respected Statewide and throughout the librarian atmosphere over there I'm sure because she's been talking all over the country and I think she knows how to catch money with the Joan of Arc I don't know how much it costs to do Joan of Arc but I bet it was enormous I was about 2500 2500 and it's a beautiful beautiful piece of art and I happened to go down and tell my brother who grew up in this town he's a lot older than I was he's I was 90 89 90 and he was just so impressed that someone would say something so important and much of what she has in that architective and and the donors that have really put out money into this Library tells us how important it is so I don't know what your plans are but I just wanted to get up because sometimes you're not a job you know you're not appreciated but I think I I think everyone should clap for this lady because she has she's given her soul for it I know you shake your head but I really really think she deserves um you know that respect on that that end because she and her staff has been enormously very helpful to the elderly in this community not me because I'm not eligible yet but basically I just I know that things will turn out fine in the long run but the library really does need to thrive not survive we need to somehow keep that thriving because she has many ideas that haven't come to pass and we need to keep those doors open okay thank you anybody else if not we'll move on to correspondence and reports you're out so we have a renewal for the cases second emotion in a second all in favor say aye aye financial report you received information for October um we continue to run very tight on cash flow though the taxes in October of last year we collected 179 thousand dollars this year we collected 452 000. wow so we had a lot of people really step up nice and it was a huge help it really really was so you know we've got that small line of credit I still have some money left on that um you know where cash is still very low but we've gotten this far we can get through when we're pay period in November and uh it's School taken care of and then in December we start to see increase in um in the property taxes so cash flow is cash flow has been a nuisance um the we're still fairly new into the year you know we're looking for around 400 000 in savings and expenses for this year um and so we've been been working with Mike fire department has uh hopefully will be a step in that direction but there's also going to be some other places we're going to be looking for that as well and um and we've got the million dollar line of credit that we've got a plan for you can't do anything about that this year we'll have to negotiate with the bank for next year the expenses were pretty much in line I noted a few things on the electricity uh which you've got folks saw on the income side um where the uh obviously two big things one was the revenue sharing which I think last year was around 70 000 this year was 110. so that was a real gift I don't know what it's going to be this much I've received it yet but that will be a big help towards getting the school taken care of this month um the other the other part is the uh income uh revenue from the ambulance and Mike will be talking to you a little bit about what's going on with the fire in the EMS but it looks like uh they've really got their billing down it's coming in Fairly regularly now and so I would anticipate that we're going to be somewhere around four hundred thousand dollars um will be more this year because of the the beginning of the year we were catching up from the prior year so we got a big bunch of money in July but as we're planning for the next fiscal year I think we can be expecting around 400 000 and that's with a very busy Ambulance Service um any questions at all on the information on the financials on the income or expenses uh Stephen good evening councils our last AWS meeting was on October 28th and our next one is going to be tomorrow so my stuff is a little bit of an awesome month behind but in September um we met our monthly budget expectations by five percent although we saw a sharp decline in recyclables which we usually budget those pretty low anyway so whatever we get to that is extra Health paying from personal expenses um that's a pretty cyclical thing in we expected that'll Trend down for six or eight months we've seen cardboard go from twenty dollars a bail to 120 a bail so it's kind of got wide variance there so we do our best guess at our budget in which we do right now but next year we'll keep that budget number of law of that was covered for that we also have had some phenomenal increases in electrical electrical costs that we're working with and trying to work around us and someone anticipated some of that in our budget last year but the rate increases were 89 which is for next year our safety officer is very diligent girl I don't know if it's not marching one of our workman's comp playing claims that we've had repeatedly outdated slipped trips and falls in the wintertime she has written a grant and gotten a standard to go on the back of the pickup truck and we'll go right up to the doorways and see it on a regular basis because it's usually an icy problem that gives us an issue with those so um we give her a lot of credits you've been on category for that and you must send another put up on them trying somebody out for us um means for going ahead and closing Presque Isle are well underway you remember the pour our cement pan this fall so the next year our contract you can go in there that's going to become almost a transfer station and it'll be that way for I think there is to me pretty close to 15 to 20 years before we wind a photo with this car into that so everything there seems to be going really ahead of budget in and on track um the dep we followed the dep for our paperwork to do that and that's that's uh takes quite a while to get so that should open will be at least before we close the landfill but everything looks pretty positive there and DEP is working with us on the experience of ourselves civil start next summer um other than that I think it's wrong the same thing any questions meet them tomorrow thank you thank you Steve good evening first I'd like to start off with uh to tell you guys about our call volume for October we ran on 62 EMS calls typically we average about 1.9 calls per day so just under two October we were just a little over that fire calls we had six so we've been busy with the ambulance and luckily knock on wood we haven't been busy for the Fireside um we got a few new volunteers like I had to talk about last time uh attendance has been very good with those with the volunteer fire department with the calls and the trainings and meetings we've had so we're making some Headway there um we're also still receiving applications here and there I would like to put a plug out there you know if there's anybody that's interested in knowing what we do or want to be part of helping out stop by give me a call we'll love to talk to the people to see let them know what they could actually have to offer us um talk about the budget a little bit like Dan had said you know we're we're working pretty hard to save and revenue is going good as of November 8th um my expense side we're about 115 000 um understand so that's showing that we do have some savings and on the revenue side we're about 79 just under seventy nine thousand dollars collected of where we should be this time of year so the billing is coming in good I mentioned the last meeting that we're looking into possibly selling some vehicles um we've got uh a ladder truck two SUVs and an ambulance I would like to look at selling um one thing that I'd like to do I'd like to you know following the town's policy as to possibly do a direct sale negotiation because these are emergency vehicles I think we can get more money for that by marketing that you know especially the SUVs marketing them as emergency vehicles we can sell them with the equipment in it to get a better bang for our money um so it's the direction I'd like to go on that I don't know if you guys have any questions or concerns on that but that's the direction I'd like to go on those we have had a lot of interest from people on all all of those Vehicles so so have the vehicles gone up are they for sale now any any bites on any of it at all so um we put it out there as far as you know just to let people know that we we they're available yeah um so the ladder truck I've done some research on that as far as value and um what I did is I spoke with the company that we actually purchased and they're probably the leader of the market for used fire trucks and they're they're pretty confident that we can sell this at that fair market value especially right now with covid um fire trucks and ambulances and stuff are two years out and then some because of Parts did they give you a fair market value on that on that ladder product what's that they give you fair market value on The Letter book did they give you somewhere what they thought was worth yes yes they gave us a you know it's a broad spectrum but you know he they they're pretty confident that we could possibly get 600 000 for that truck so that's pretty good I mean it's more but we pay for it so it's it's a good starting point absolutely yeah any other questions on that um another thing I wanted to talk to you guys about I think we're going to talk about later is nmcc has reached out to our department they want to do a partnership with their clinical externship so what that is is there are ems students that go to nmcc they need clinical time you know for their licensing so in the past they've actually come here before and they go to other area departments but for some reason or another they pulled out of here and now they're they're asking they want to come back to me um so like I said I think we really should move forward in that direction it's actually a really good thing for us it shows that they trust our service and our quality of care you're volunteers or getting up to where you uh like to see the Manpower we're still a little light on Manpower but uh there's been a big change with with attendance good after we're getting decent attendance for trainings and meetings and the calls we've we've been able to handle everything our own nice we haven't had to call mutually yet good another thing that I've been working on is uh the AFT Grant it's the Federal grant for firefighters and fire departments the workshop process has started and the grants will be opening from early spring in order to be able to put in for these grants you have to attend these workshops they give you pointers and stuff like that so we're starting that process to look at ways to save some more money for ourselves as well yeah oh my God for right now if you guys got any other oh thank you you spend any time with that did you so that the the licensing yeah yes so the last time we had talked um our license was due to expire November 30th for the ambulance and the rigs were to expire it's been a lot of work I met with Dr Beth columnar quite a few times and we are licensed for another year for the ambulance service is a huge relief a lot of big weight off my shoulders that uh gives me more time to focus on on other areas that was a I mean Mike was in here probably less than two weeks and that was in front of him and uh it was hard for me to get his attention because he was pretty focused on because if he doesn't have a license he's not operating anyway he did a really great job a lot of times when they submit those licenses they don't automatically get approved they kick them back and I think they'd come back within 10 minutes I was floored so that was uh that was that was a job well done good job brand new employee really well thank you Michael thank you Mike good work uh the community resilience partnership Grant this is something that had been started it was a collaboration uh Supreme Court caribou and washroom has to do with money that came from the governor's office for climate change issues and so I kind of came in on the middle of it uh part of the issue was is that they had the decision the group decision of the three communities was to look to buy right-of-ways along roads where they uh when the wind is long in the wintertime they drift heavily and then plant trees create a national proper and that doesn't work with the unfortunately the cost was too great for the amount of money that was out there right and also the whole issue about you know some of the places that you needed the to get the right-of-way there were windows were not interested in giving it can be that they'd have to sell targets so um it kind of got kicked back and so what we're looking at now is uh Darren and Andrea went up to for Kent and looked at this new monitoring system that they have in their diet which is you can remotely monitor the water levels because once a water level gets at a certain level then you've got to start the pumps to pump the water and instead of having to have somebody right there 24 7 if you've got your English or remotely monitor that you can easily keep track of what the water level is or need somebody there you can get them there and my dream law gave us a a bid on that for 11 250 I submitted the paperwork to the governor's office uh and they said they would get back to me uh this is not going to be something that's going to happen right off but once we get approval I do think that we need at least get one more bid uh just to be just to follow our policy but at least we've got something that we can put in there and uh so that is uh I think we're going to be able to do something with that it would be great to get that behind us [Applause] we had um Keith and Pat Uh participated in the elected official elected officials webinar yesterday um we've got them uh their Municipal officers manual and so I know that they're uh working very hard at memorizing that they're all figured out before before their first meeting in January so we've uh everything is by Zoom now so we got that taken care of solar farm developments we've had a lot of discussion about that lately um the planning board right now we have two solar Farms that are being constructed we got three that are in the planning stages and uh we have one that is being developed fairly close to residential homes there's some real concerns about this and so there's been some discussion about a role that the council plays in Ole Miss and I know that Melissa's been really interested in this and I've asked Tony to be here so that he could ship because Tony is the one who works with the planning board and in the process around these these sorts of land use uh regulations um so that you get shared I would like to find and I want to speak briefly by May Mr chair absolutely thank you Tony the uh I don't know Fort Fairfield uses are Guided by the zoning ordinance which is adopted by the town of council and the authority have in jurisdiction for review of most of the change in uses is the planning board we've made up of citizens of Fort Fairfield and they're very very citizen minded and they're very very good at what I think they do to make sure that their decision is defensible which is the biggest part we don't want to end up in a little engagement because somebody just wants to go through their decisions are based on findings of fact and conclusions of law and currently the zoning board is specifies for review of the solar Farms commercial soda farms under Public Utilities the public utilities is defined and the whole zoning ordinance is anything that generates power or water or anything else that you might call Energy and in order to amend that document the spelled right out in this section from the zoning ordinance itself and it's a process and we want to make sure that we do not to keep our ordinance by being in opposition to a federal law or state law or another ordinance that we have on the books and normally it spells it right out here an amendment can be done by a volatile planning board it could be done by the town officers to request the planning board an individuals who request a plan board or written Petition of a number of Voters equal to at least 10 percent of the voters in the last combinatorial election so then it spells out the process that we have to follow and like I've mentioned to Dan earlier today that we may need to make sure that whatever we decide has changed or whatever we decide to do would change I would like to make sure that it meets the standards acceptable to the state and that normally takes a cursory review at least a main Municipal Association legal services and or our own legal counsel then you still have to follow the process once the planning board brings you a proposed amendment then an ordinance would be prepared for you to consider and if introduced a public hearing would have to be held and if a public hearing was held and decisions were made we had four choices at that time you can approve it as presented you can amend it you can table it or you can deny it take what coming further information but the process needs to be followed no matter what and playing board has a job to do and I believe they're very conscientious for every citizen of the town of Fort period when they're making their decisions is the standard being met if the standard is not being met it can be met but it's probably going to be a condition of approval and nothing's going to happen until conditional approval which is a line and that's all the New York ordinance too allowing you to get conditions or approvals or denials but again the standards that they have currently are in the zoning ordinance and specifically site design review process now is it perfect I don't believe so but I've seen an awful lot of sample solar farm ordinances that are going around the state of Maine right now because we're attending stuff we want to be the best informed that we possibly can be and a lot of those standards are not enforceable you make decisions based on something that's not enforceable anybody with Deep Pockets that wants to change your decision to what their decision would be and take you to court and the judge remands it back to the planning board to address what's wrong and that's expensive as so this is the fourth grip you'll just pointed out we're struggling with making ends meet yeah so that's that's a quick overview if you'd have specific changes that you want to see to these ordinance it should be spent in writing to the planning board the plan board would consider what they would do to implement that change and begin the process and break bring a recommendations Council ultimately the vote for adoption or denial of an ordinance remains with that legislative body until then the decision to approve or deny an application Remains What the planning again based on finding the fact and conclusions of law quite unsentimate any questions about the process any other things thank you for allowing it thank you Tony on the um Kelly of rustic we received their proposed budget just wanted to let you know that uh 8.24 they had a a public hearing on November 15th I don't know if anybody decided to go attend um I'm sure it was not well attended so our payment um when we make it or next year we'll go up by 22 842 so it'll be at 300 000. that is Kelly uh and then the last thing under reports is uh I attended my first acoustic Municipal association meeting in 10 years it was it was interesting seeing some of the old faces there were actually a few that were still there really yeah uh and that's all I have on the reports thank you all right um next we'll go into new business the first thing is uh this is that the request of AWS that they uh they but their board has met the degree to extend a promissory note from November 30th to January 31st they just they wanted me to sign a note uh based on that extension and ask the council to approve it if you guys can do that I'd appreciate it it's almost second we had a motion in a second uh we'll vote all in favor say aye aye aye um I don't know if I have too much I need to say about the audit Financial segment after Gary's presentation um you know this is this is something that's not new to you folks you've been gone through this we understand what the issues are um we understand why I'm here why I chose to do this why I think you hired me uh to to do um so clearly uh you know we've got some we've got some Financial issues that we got to straighten out it's not going to be easy it's not going to be fun um and um it's not going to happen without losing some employees that's just the bottom line uh there were two material witnesses that were identified in the audit both of those have been rectified um and so I would ask the council to approve the audience financial statement that was presented by Felch and Company all right so look at that second a little motion and a second all in favor say aye aye and that will be for those of you who are here who will be on the website sometime tomorrow um we've talked we talked a little bit about this at the last meeting one of part of what we need to do with the EMS is that we need to be utilizing more part-time and on-call people if we don't have part-time at on-call people then um we're using only full-time people and every dollar they spend or an employee who is full-time you're spending about 40 cents for benefits it's just very expensive um I think that the uh Mike has got me pretty well convinced that though I won't say I wouldn't say that I was there initially um that we're better off to have a service we are I don't think it's any question about that we just can't afford what we had I think that's pretty clear so if we need to find a way other communities do it and as Mike and I have talked it's not going to be easy um but we need to find other ways of being able to provide this service well without having to always depend upon full-time folks so we have uh we have someone who would like to be uh to be used as everyone call who's a very experienced team ttmt um but it's Mike's wife and we have a policy that says that um no person shall be hired and no employees shall be promoted while the relative exercise is supervisory authority over that person and because of the circumstances that we're in because it's only on call if it was full-time I would have reservations but it's only an alcohol position on asking the council to allow but they need to be hired and be able to work in the EMS Department [Music] second we had a motion in a second all in favor say aye aye thank you um I I can tell you I have not enjoyed revisiting this whole thing with PayPal Uh Kevin and I had a lot of conversations I spoke with Scott today uh who I can tell you wasn't what happened pretty upset and I don't know if I really blame him I've been looking at ways that um if we can meet the intent of the of the council because it was clear the council and I personally feel that this is very good for the channel for Fairfield there is nothing going to be done the land hasn't been surveyed and won't be surveyed till spring so we've got plenty of time in Swan and I talked about that obviously they're not going to be building any building anytime in the near future they're not prepared to do that so what I'm asking the council is that you've you've already approved this but we need to do it by ordinance so we've got time I want to be able to introduce an ordinance will have the uh the public hearing and then we can bring it in councils can approve it again and we'll be good um as far as dealing with the fair market value issue I think that we can meet the tip of what the council wanted to do because of the what Cape health is planning on doing in terms of adding employees and adding more infrastructure and that is through the um land and Senate program that was created back in 2016. I think Gary was part of that and um and so basically and Scott and I talked a little bit about this so basically what we're doing is we're not transferring the title to them initially we're going to lease it with their ability to purchase it and they're going to be given either a three or five year period of the I told Scott whatever it is that you feel comfortable to be able to develop what they're planning on doing if they develop the building they bring in the extra people they do the work that they're going to be doing then we transfer the property over to their name and we invent public benefit we've demonstrated it and we have a we have a a economic development program that was developed you know by the community approved by the council that defines public benefit so they can still get the land for a dollar uh we can get we can get the transfer approved by um uh by ordinance and and we can get a new building and have a business uh growing in prepared cameras sounds like a winner to me yeah so I would ask the council to allow me to move forward uh under that scenario in Mr chair I'd like to introduce ordinance for Kate belt for Cape hell so the public hearing set up because I know I know the program you're talking about Dan because I was on with Gary when did Anderson it's an ideal situation that if if something doesn't materialize and we get to land back but it's not the materialize we can give myself we had a motion in a second all in favor say aye you don't vote on if I could introduce the ordinance I thought you said we had a vote on it no no I just had to introduce the noise I wish I had it here but I can I can write it based upon what you're saying so that that works for me as well no uh so just so the council knows what we the first thing we have to do is I mean we'll take care of the organist part but we've got to put together a purchase and sale agreement which outlines the responsibilities of the town of Fort Fairfield responsibilities of Cape Town and then once the parties have signed that then we get uh VR Smith to do the uh we get them lined up to do the survey and then uh Mr Courier can prepare the um uh the lease agreement at least so that's going to be kind of the process but thanks Mitch um the other thing that I would I would like to explore is we have uh it was brought to my attention that we probably should be looking to see if we can sell some Town land that we own and we've got three land leases and champagne Grove um we've got uh two that are old BNA leases once under a storage building that Gary old stairway another one's afraid of house that used to be the barn state house but now Gene hellstrom has and then uh Philippa Collins is leasing land in front of is one of his potato houses so what I'd like to do is I'd like the council to agree to allow me to approach the three landowners to see if they'd be willing to purchase the property under their buildings for the assessed value of the property and then use those funds to see what we can do to help clean up up in that area thank you foreign College and um we have an agreement that Mike would be signing on behalf of the town of Fort Fairfield to have them send students over here to work with our staff on on EMS calls so this is really this is great for Mike it shows their um comfort level with the level of professionalism that he represents it also gives those students an opportunity to see the fort Fairfield not just to meet the people but the you know to work within our community perhaps they might want to work here afterwards after their training so I would ask the council to approve Mike signing that contract with northern Maine Medical SoMo second an emotion in a second all in favor say aye aye uh I had a couple of other things under new business one is is that similar to uh Mike uh with his vehicles um Matt has two uh Surplus um SUVs that he wants to be able to Market uh again the policy allows for us to be able to Market it without having to book the bid uh they are emergency vehicles they have Emergency Equipment in them they're probably going to be sold that way uh and Matt wants feels that he can do a much better job than going through a bid process so I'd like to have you folks sign off on him being able to do that okay so much a second an emotion in a second all in favor say aye aye one more so we listen to Gary and what he had to say about where we are in Diane yes is that your name yes Diane okay thank you you didn't call me Brenda that's good and she's related um you know it's I I instruct there's a reason why I couldn't do this job there's a reason why I was asked to do the job and I've got 15 years of experience as a town manager and I can tell you that my heart of hearts I know what it is I need to do in order to get us back on financial planning and I cannot do that without creating some pain and discomfort and that's just um it's I am looking this is just this is this is part of the process that you're going to be hearing again and again and you're going to be hearing passionate folks how they feel about whatever it is that we're looking at cutting and it's just it's just a fact of life and um it's it's just not an easy thing but it's something that I am willing to do is something that I can do if I'm allowed to so back in October I sent you folks a memo talking about reducing the the hours at the library and it was my judgment that the best way to make this work was going to three days a week utilizing the two part-time employees and volunteers you can look at the financials that I've been working on this week um and as you can see that if we do this um if I'm if we're able to move forward on this I can save us almost sixty thousand dollars this year when you get close to between 85 and 90 000 next year I think that we've been we can uh the Integrity of life on the library will be fine it will be able to meet the needs of most of our patients and um I think that um I am very very confident that the library will be managed well so what I'm asking the council is I need your approval to be able to go to three days a week to be able to terminate the library director and to maintain the two part-time employees so that I can achieve this financial goal that we need to do would this be the only Town that's done that Dan no I'm not supposed to be speaking at a tearing but I mean this is unusual to me to have the library of targeted I mean I would be happy to talk about this after the meeting but this is not the time it's the council um the Board of Trustees has made an offer um that they're willing to contribute six thousand three hundred fifty dollars of board funds to supplement the budget right um keeping the librarian on so wouldn't that be the same thing and we could review like how much use the library like I'm not opposed to lessening the hours but to keep the librarian on if they're willing to put the money in then the town's not out anything wouldn't it be more beneficial to us to have her there Alyssa in my judgment that is not the answer and the primary reason why it's not the budget um I I don't it's not the budget the budget the issue for me is is having adequate employees working there one person cannot work run the library we need more than one people one person right so but right now we have one librarian in two parts we have three people that's correct okay so the under my scenario we're going to have it we'll have two they're going to be working for the three days that were open and when somebody can't be there we'll have volunteers we'll be able to step in so but if the librarian is willing it says she's willing to go along with the reduced hours eliminate her benefits her retirement um I mean wouldn't it be better to have her and one part-time well listen that's one person right but so her and one part-time versus two part-time that don't have the experience or the knowledge they have plenty of experience in the ownership foreign I just I can't grasp the thing to fire the library and keep two part-timers if we're going to reduce hours then obviously we'd have to reduce hours of the director and at one part-timer so I think the parts the person that's been there the longest should be staying and the person has not been there long it should be first one out oh you got two-part timer you got two parts you're getting rid of the full-time position and you've got two part timers so if you take the full-time position and change that to a part-time position and keep one of the other part-timers you'll have two people foreign that is not what I think we should be doing I I think we addressed that I hear English and I'm just telling you you guys hired me to do a job and I'm doing it but if it's monetary then it's the money isn't different than I would say the experience is worth more than not but but I have all the folks in the world the library will be really fun I really would like to address this uh at this time I I would just like to keep this amongst the table right now I'm I'm sure from the main library Commission I still we we've heard everything Library the last you will it's right in here it's it's Jonathan facility the library no matter how small has a permanent paid Library director who is responsible for the administration of Library services if you do not have that you will lose your library designation and this isn't even about me no no no no I don't care who your director is you need to have a director all right if you don't you lose your main State Library designation if you lose that you use your federal Library thank you yeah motion is I'll second it got a motion in a second we'll go to vote Melissa no Jim hi and I vote I think that's all I have it next we uh got the minute on a regular Town council meeting on October 19 2022. oh I need a motion oh you did you motioned we had a second all in favor say aye we also have the uh

stands one nation's under God and indivisible with liberty and justice for all next we'll go to public comment period anybody has anything they'd like to say and uh Speech your name Mr chair yes hats hands hands up or hands up through the Fort Fairfield Police Department I guess we've got a bunch of burglary around town execute the water today and I get to get to see the water property that was going from five different or four or five different burglaries and so I think these are a good job foreign if not uh we'll move on to correspondence and reports license and permits okay uh Roberts no licenses or permits for this month all right financial report interesting times um you folks received the financial report income and expenses we got three months in 25 percent uh most everything is in line our overall expenses are at 21.8 percent uh we got a few line items that are over budget but nothing of any great significance uh income has been pretty much as we planned so there's no um nothing to report on the EMS as of this October as of October 17th we've taken in 21 800 dollars which is uh which is good for October if you if you um look at for the rest of the month if that saves the same we're going to be looking at well over thirty thousand dollars for the month um September was 28 000 uh 775 dollars so if you're looking at at least two months um and Mike's going to be talking a little bit more about this under Fire Department but the fire department report but I think it is it's a reasonable expectation that we could be somewhere between 320 to 350 000 in annual income which is which is important to know uh part cash flow continues to still be very very tight as you know I sent a letter to the County Commissioners I sent a letter to the landfill and I met with Tim gold all regarding monies that we owe those individuals the County Commission the county tax is normally paid at the end of this month and we can't and I've sent a letter to the County Commissioners requesting allowing us to pay that in January that's almost 300 000. the note that we have with AWS is 275 thousand dollars um and that is due to the end of November I don't think it's a reasonable expectation that we're going to be able to do that so I have asked them for an extension uh to January as well and I've talked with Mark I've talked with Ryan Pelletier uh both of them are understanding of our situation and are certainly willing to work with us we were able to pay the school last month but we had we paid it late and I met with Tim dope and talked about that we are we are now at a point where we need to pay the schools 183 thousand dollars and I can't do that right now so Tim has been very understanding um and they certainly willing to work with the town but it's just one of the things that we are dealing with you've noticed on the warrants that we only have one this month uh 565 thousand dollars and of that right now I'm still holding 65 000 with the checks that I haven't paid um we had in the bank about 130 000 right now we've got payroll coming up uh on a Tuesday and that's about a hundred thousand we got the school payment of 183 000. that is doing so we clearly don't have enough money to to both of those things we haven't received our Revenue sharing check and so that will be a help but it's still we're still going to be a little short well um Ella got a notice uh today that we last year we received on the 21st kind of notice and and we received 80 something thousand last year she received a notice that there's that there's a deposit pending deposits 110 000. so it's it's we we have been getting more this year than we received last year that would be quite a joke so that would certainly be a big help going towards these things but it hasn't deposited yet so that's what we're looking at um it's um we do have a 300 000 line of credit um in order to make the school payment uh last month we brought down we drew down 175 000. so we got 125 000 to get us through till the end of November uh December at least for that and I have to say that hats off to Gary stairway I've had a number of people who have mentioned to me about uh paying taxes or and despite the fact that the tax bill is 36 probably here and I can tell you that um I've been honest to God I've been humbled by the reception that I've received from taxpayers for some reason I mean it's this is not fun for anybody for some people it's a struggle it really is a struggle uh last October we took in for the whole month 174 thousand dollars as of the 18th of this month are taken in 271 000 wow so Gary thank you I actually had somebody say to me then well really make a difference if we pay our taxes early I said God yes please um but people have been amazing and the only other thing I want to say about that is um this guy came in I have no idea who he is his name is Arthur Morrow he came in and he paid his taxes and he took this little note and written note and he gave it to Ella and he said I want you to give us a d imposter that's what he said and so the note says dan Foster I'm paying this early so you can get out of debt sooner I know you will good luck Arthur Morrow that was good you think yes I'm telling you I I get that I just made it just really set me back it really did so all I can say is the citizens have stepped up you know they're taking it and they have been amazing in that whole process um and it's uh you know it's our turn yeah so we've got you know we've got you know we've got some we've got some tough days ahead of us as far as we need to get that we need to get that budget down and that's something that we're working on um and we're going to be talking about a little bit later um so I think that's everything I wanted the only one call that I guess I want to make is um I guess I just want to just note that this has been Tony has fielded a lot of calls I have fielded a number and I've had a number of people come in and see me Ella has had an incredible amount of people because that's where they have to go see to pay and there have been a lot of people I've been really struggling with this and Ella has been very proactive and telling that they can make payments and this is all extra work for her because she makes she makes up the monthly payments that they're going to make and I'll tell you she has really gone above and beyond as far as I'm concerned she's been proactive she's been helpful and um and she's just done a really good job along with everything else that she does this is It's been a busy month for her so I just want to say that as well any questions on the financial nope um the AWS report I mean we've listed as a report that we haven't met tomorrow correct next next week yeah a week for them yeah yeah so so you may have two next one um the um I just wanted to briefly mention the uh the colbit funds that we received we get it's it is a grant that we received in in order to keep the money we have to comply with their requirements which means filling out reports and that hasn't been done and I really do not know much about it I contacted my Municipal Association and I talked with the Neil Goldberg who was extremely helpful the money comes from the treasury Department and they have their own website where you need to go on and file your compliance reports plus how how the your actual documentation profile the money was used and it is it's it's a little cumbersome and Neil was very helpful so I just want to let you know that I've got four documents I have to file I've got three of them done the fourth one I will have once we receive the auditor financial statement so we should be in compliance we should be all set we shouldn't have to worry about federal government coming in ask us to pay that 347 000 back which would not be helpful um on the we did uh receive the preliminary preliminary audited financial report and I guess the thing I want to say about that is when I left here in 2013 our audited Financial reports are about 25 pages long this one I think was 45. uh you know it could have been a written in Greek I don't know if I would have understand it any better what what will be doing we we will have the Audrey report for the next council meeting once I get that we're going to we'll get posted on the website you'll be doing that post on the website for the citizens and you every all the councils will be getting your coffee and you've already had a meeting with Giselle so you have a rough idea already of what we can expect with the report we will go over some of the highlights as over the place of the budget part of uh at our next council meeting but it's in order for them to be in compliance um it's a very cumbersome document it really really is anybody have any questions about the uh you saw the representation letter that Alan and I had signed yeah fire department report so uh Mike and I was sharing this and I'm going to start it might spend here if we can have and he's going to share with you uh some of the things that he's been doing he's been very busy he's working doing a good job Mike and I I want I want Council alone I want the citizens to know that Mike and I met with the the city manager for Presque Isle the fire chief and the deputy fire chief uh for Prescott and they have made an offer to the town they will provide Ambulance Service to the town for 65 dollars person which amounts to 215 800. that would be service coming from Prescott not coming from Fort Fairview so we if we are looking at income of around 320 to 350 000 then our Baseline for if we were going to provide the service here which I can tell you which is where Mike wants to go with this and um we're going to be looking at a baseline of around 565 to 575 thousand dollars so if if we can provide this service for somewhere around there taking the income that we anticipate that we will take in it would be a break even it would be so we can go with Presque Isle only going to cost the 200 000 but we're going to lose money when the income so that's how Mike and I want to approach this and um we've already broken out the current budget into three line items into three separate budgets one for EMS one for fire department and one for debt Debt Service so in the budget that we have now which is almost 1.7 million dollars you've got 250 000 of that is Debt Service um you've got the fire department is a portion of that and you EMS is a portion of that so in the future when you're going to be looking at budgets you're going to be looking at three different budgets so that we're comparing Apples to Apples and I think that that's important it's important for the community to understand that and obviously for you folks to make a decision you need to see that information and at some point Mike and I will be making a recommendation of the council as to how we would like to proceed with EMS in Fort Fairfield but we are clearly not there yet but it's just getting the speed wet so saying that Michael good evening good evening needless to say it's been a very very busy week and a half some of the things I've been working on um recruitment of volunteers as you guys know we really don't have any um So within this first week and a half I've already got eight applications turned in and as of Friday we'll have six brand new volunteer employees with experience they've been on the department before they're willing to come back and help out and on top of that I've got at least six more applications that I've personally handed out that that I'm waiting to be returned so slowly but surely we can get our numbers back to help with that um one thing that I do want to comment is EMS providers there's a big shortage in EMS providers and it's very hard to turn EMS providers away um so at some point um we may have to approach the board you know but because of nepotism things because I really don't think that we can afford to turn volunteers away but we'll talk about that when that time comes um one thing that I've been looking at for to help us out is I believe we have a very large surplus of equipment that we really don't need um so I've been taking some time looking over some equipment as you guys are aware we have some equipment to set up a third grade honestly if where we're at right now I don't see us having a need for a third grade right now we we need to focus on on you know our community first and that third grade would be for Trans transports we don't have to prove to do long distance transfers at this time so that's one one way we can look at uh probably seeing if there's other communities out there that might need this to help us bring some money back in to take care of some of our debt um I said I've been looking through everything there's there's some fat there you know that hasn't been looked at before I've recently canceled some cell phones we we have no need of four cell phones there's only three people on during the day and two people 24 7 what do we need four celebrities for really um I've also have recently returned some gym equipment I don't know for what reason it was purchased we have a gym upstairs and the rec department is very willing to work with us to use their equipment and it's decent equivalent there so that's that's some way of savings that I've been looking at um another way at reducing our debt I've been looking at Staffing levels in the past we've had 11 full-time employees right now we're at seven counting myself so right now during the day I'm I'm here and I've been on top of the day-to-day stuff and I've been working on some of these problems I've also been covering on the ambulance to eliminate overtime while our EMTs are in class I've been working on eliminating some overtime by bringing on some new volunteer staff and DNS providers and by by doing this so far I think we've almost been able to cut payroll in half so it's definitely a savings and that may be able to get better you know excuse me it will thank you so some of the equipment that you're you're mentioning is that equipment that we we own or are we making payments on it or is it so so far the equipment that I've mentioned uh we we own the I haven't touched yet on the area ladder truck and the ambulances um we do not own those lists some of the debt that the game was talking about I really think that we need to think hard about this ladder truck don't get me wrong it's beautiful it's amazing I've always wanted one but with the Aging the ages of our engines they're hitting 20 years old next year in January um we can lump those along for for a few years but honestly I don't think we can lump them along for the term of that loan on that ladder truck and I I know it not going to be financially feasible to replace those while we still have that debt so I think we really need to think about uh think about that long and hard and obviously we wouldn't do anything without talking to the board first anyway but I think we need to think about that yeah another thing is is the the two ambulances again beautiful piece of equipment uh I was shocked when I took them for a ride it's they're very nice I think we need to think about as well uh one way to reduce debt there is looking at getting rid of one of them and replacing it with a used one that's quite a bit cheaper that we can afford because again right now I think we need to start from you know the bare minimum and then work our way back up that a a used one to replace that one would would uh be used as a backup if something happened to that first rig if it's in the shop it doesn't have to be a fancy Wiglet we have right now so I think that's something that we we also should look at as well and see what we can do there like I said it's been a it's been a busy weekend ahead on top of all this I'm doing the day-to-day stuff and helping out on covering the rig another area that I've looked at is as Vehicles quite a few support Vehicles again we're to people and myself on a shift in the day we have four support Vehicles two SUVs and two pickups I at some point I might I may approach you guys to get rid of a few um all these vehicles we have to maintain and it takes a lot of money to maintain vehicles and that's just that's one way to save a little bit of money is we honestly don't have any for for support vehicles um I've also been very busy with how many people right now I'd say two if we could get rid of two and keep two would be better because honestly two of them have been sitting there so one of the other things I've been busy on is re-licensing the ambulance service it's due November 30th along with the licensing on the ambulances themselves it's a very very big process I've had a couple meetings so far with Dr Beth polymorph she is the medical director for our Ambulance Service she's an ER Doc and she's the medical director for many other services in the county she's taken quite a bit of time out of her busy schedule to come here to help us her big reasoning is is she sees it and she wants this to be successful and she she sees a need with our Asian Community to have an ambulance here so she's willing to do whatever she can to help us get through this and so she's been been very good at helping me with this process so I'm hoping within the next week that we can actually send our license in ahead of time so we're not scrambling a nice minute and I've been working with billing they have been fantastic I don't know how long we've been with this building company I haven't even had time to research that but I've been in contact with them updated contact information and as long as we are proactive with getting the information to them they are every week they're pulling the previous week's calls out and billing and getting them to us within seven days that's pretty impressive so that's one thing that that I am making sure that I take time for is billing we're proactive with it and give it to them every time they're collecting they're collecting any of this so that's going well I've also been reaching out to our surrounding fire departments Dan said we talked with prescala get a meeting of course now again tomorrow um they they have showed interest in possibly looking at one of our grits and some equipment they've got any port as well um I've reached out with Limestone Easton and they are very excited to be doing to be more involved with forecast because some of the Departments we haven't been involved with for a while and they're so they want to help us so good stuff so I'm sure there's more I'm sure I forgot something but uh if you guys have any questions for me been busy yeah yeah we're fortunate to have you on board we appreciate you thank you very much and going through the process of what you're doing um again those as well that you know I I really feel strongly about giving an ambulance service here in this town and I I know we can make it affordable too so this will be an ongoing report for a while uh to the council until we get things resolved so great job thank you thank you very much um in uh we we decided that we were going to keep puddled off kind of been for this winter we're not going to eat it they've gone in the winterized it and so we'll save ourselves some money there in this stuff first of all is uh Kevin here at snow um I just gave you a flyer for fall Fun Fest talked a little bit about that but uh that's coming up and that's a pretty big deal I'm not they haven't allowed me participate because I know I don't fit the age group dynamics but anyway uh they uh the the fire departments involved the police departments involved um uh obviously the right Department uh and then plus a lot of other organizations and they bring the kid the kids meet down at the Gazebo they March up uh with all the Fanfare and they have a hot dog roast and they have games and that sort of stuff and you know they they have a lot of folks at the state and have a great time so a lot of fun too well yeah but especially with my grandchildren a couple years ago really oh yeah just amazing when they got the chunks and stuff up here they need to pass out the candy afternoon yeah but the kids have a great time yeah it's it's great it's good that we do stuff like that so anyway so Kevin's kind of hidden that up and uh just wanted to let you know and that is all we have under reports okay next we'll go to new business okay you have a memo uh that I put together I've had two requests from Community organizations uh to to regain access to the community room at the library um this was and that has been a sorority and they had they had done this for a while um that was initially as I understand it stopped by Jim Reiser um and apparently the rationale was that public spaces were not going to utilize by Beyond governmental groups I mean it was designed that would be used by the employees and that was going to be it I don't understand the rationale you know Jim's on here to talk about it but and then the decision was made that it was an insurance issue so I researched it I met with fap body I talked to them and they said no this is not an insurance issue um it's not that these facilities that that that's what that world was designed for and that it can be used so um I have a couple thoughts on this first off I would like I would like the Council on asking the council to allow the sorority and the ATV Pub to be able to start meeting back in the communities community room again in the library I want to do that I had a long talk with Kevin sinal about the community center and I'm not I am not prepared to make any kind of recommendation on that because um uh I I really think we need to have some kind of a policy around this whole thing one of the things that I find a little just disturbing is that any one person uh can just arbitrarily say no that's not going to happen I don't think that I should be able to do that I don't think Jim Rising should be on the I don't think anyone person should do that I think that if this is really a decision for the community that the communities you know decides that this is this is a facility for our our organization's new account and yes we want them to use it or no we don't and that really goes for you guys that needs to be Council of decision and it needs to be codified so that if somebody comes along and says you know I don't want that to happen anymore that's not what they're called it's your call so but I'm not prepared to really present anything as a release of community center and I do think we need a sense of time thinking about who does get to use these facilities what I can tell you is that they have been used by sorority they have been used by the ATV Club for multiple years they have been supportive of the organizations they have now I know the ATV pop on a TV for the community room downstairs the sorority and block tables and chairs and there has never been an issue with them utilizing that space so I would least like those two organizations to be allowed to do that where they had been able to do it before and there's never been any issues hopefully at some point down the road whether it's me or whether it's a person who takes a share we'll sit down with the council and come up with some sort of a policy that makes sense um I know that one of the things that I think we should think about is there really as a release of the community center we had two issues we have programs and we have facility and so really what we've done is we've kind of melded the two together and we've made Kevin responsible for the facility because the majority of these programs are there and uh and I don't know if that's fair to Kevin and I don't I I think there needs to be a distinction made um and we just need to think about it talk about it and put something together that makes sense and obviously the community needs to be involved uh in that decision so with all that said I would like to ask the council for permission and to allow the sorority in the ATV Club to be able to have their monthly meetings back at the library in the community room and I just wanted to ask that Melissa and I talked about this and that she feels that it's an appropriate request um did you have something I was just going to say that room was never closed off to any different uh any community group until the insurance thing came up that room had always been open to any group at any point in time we're both in the church issue up Kevin Kevin had the insurance company approached Kevin and when Kevin brought it up to the town manager's time it was brought up to me that we were also doing it and because we have to hand out keys and there is no staff there well you got a letter here from that by people by insurance so at this time if I had a motion do we have any discussion on that uh we'll go for about me thank you do you have an upcoming uh public hearing at some point for some other reason so I'm just think you're looking for some Euclid on this topic uh you know before asking the community to come maybe we can like the two words with one stone I'll go over other type of performance together um we have the delivery election approval which is uh standard stuff it's coming up we need to have a council photo and the opening and closing the location the election Ward and the approval of election election clerks please accept it we had a motion in a second any discussion on vote about Mitchell thank you very much and last thing in a new business is our general assistance rates which we do every year right yes yes I do okay good and that's it for new business and next we got the minutes and we're regular council meeting on September 28th 2012. we had a motion and second all in favor say aye all right we got the warrants number eight 565 000 9.87 remember exactly get a motion in a second all in favor say aye King another one is that a motion in a second all in favor say aye aye aye thank you nobody I want to thank everybody,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,AbYD1LpoE5E,Regular Town Council Meeting 28Sept22,,66.0,3967.0,2022-09-29T11:40:08Z,none,928,2,0,0,action to some people nosing as you know a long life resident as a town manager uh he is acting seat and I'm going to turn it over to him uh at the start of this meeting to bring some information that everybody's wondering about and answer some questions so at this time Dan Foster thank you Robert folks thanks for coming I really do appreciate it it's been an interesting 10 days I can tell you that um a lot of you have seen the memo from Felch and um and it's the reason why I'm addressing you tonight because there are a lot of concerns and I can tell you that they're very legitimate 15 years that I was filmed manager one of the things that always stuck in my head was the whole idea of having a sustainable community and uh it is it is a it's a balance you have a it's a it's like a three-legged stool you've got three major stakeholders in maintaining a sustainable community so you've got the residents the residents are looking for services you've got the taxpayer the taxpayer has to pay for those services and you've got the employees who have to provide those services and I can I can tell you that if any one of those gets out of whack it affects all three in what the situation in we're in right now is that the financial side of town government is more than just out of whack we are really we are not in a good place so the a couple of things that I want to share with you that will highlight why we are where we are so the first thing is is that you're going to be getting a tax bills next you're going to tax bills next month and the tax bill that you got last year was 19 and a half Mills the one that you're going to get this year is going to be 26 and a half meals it's a seven mil increase it's 36 percent it is um unconscionable as far as I'm concerned and it's one of the reasons why as I got became more familiar with what was going on out there enjoying my retirement at Blue Birches uh that really caused me to want to be part of the process because I honestly feel that I can help with this and and I'm very concerned so just so that everybody understands the reason why we're at 26 and a half mils I don't know what you're hearing okay but let me tell you something first of all it's not because of the revaluation it's got nothing to do with that and it certainly does not have anything to do with the school the school budget over the last five years has led up less than six percent the reason why we're at 26 and a half Mills is because town government in the last four years has gone up 76 percent now that's why I mean we've almost doubled the cost of operating this town over the last four years and that is just simply not sustainable um one of the primary reasons why we've seen that kind of seen that kind of increase and it's kind of like it's the elephant in the room and that's the fire department in the EMS you know four years ago that budget was a hundred and forty thousand dollars this year that budget is one million six hundred and sixty five thousand dollars now everybody in The Rustic County everybody in University county if they call 9-1-1 they're going to get an ambulance but I am telling you right now that Fort Fairfield residents have the dubious distinction of being the most expensive service of any place in Aristo County and I don't mean not quite just a little so yes we have to have ambulance service but we can't afford what we have now we cannot afford it not just the bottom line I don't know how else to say it that is that is it's not something that we can continue to do um and one of the things that I'm going to be doing tonight is I'm going to be recommending to the council uh I'm going to be pointing a new fire chief and this will be the fourth fire chief in the same amount of years so there's not been a lot of stability in that department and I can tell you that I am ecstatic about telling you that Mike gel beer is going to be our new fire chief I know Mike Mike was fire chief when I finished up when I was Town manager Mike is respected in this community he's respected in the fire department Community he understands what it takes to run a volunteer fire department and we're going to have to include we're going to include the EMS part of the process that we're going to be going through is that every month Mike's going to be coming to the council he's going to be talking about what's working what's not working what's expensive what isn't and Mike along with Matt Cummings was our police chief are going to be working under an umbrella of Public Safety to make sure that this community has the services that we should have at a price that we that we can afford and that just that just has not been happening and I can tell you as long as I'm here that is something that I'm going to be striving for um and um this is a little troubling for me and quite honestly um it probably this is probably upset me more than anything the reason why your taxes are going from 19 and a half the 26 and a half is because last year last year the tax rate calculation form was not filled out correctly now when I first heard that I'm like that I just don't believe it I just don't know how that could happen and what happened was that the tax assessor added in our Revenue sharing the amount of 730 000 twice so what that did was that it reduced the amount of money that we needed to collect from property taxes by seven hundred and thirty thousand dollars so that meant that we spent last year 730 000 more than what we took in you know guess what they did to our cash flow which is the second thing that I want to talk to you about the part about this that really bothers me is that for the 15 years that I was Town manager we run our budget rents from July 1 to June 30th and every March I start my Excel spreadsheet for the budget for the next year and I can tell you as a town manager you live eat breathe and die by that spreadsheet there by the time June rolls around I know most of those numbers by heart and I can tell you this that if I'm in the tax assessor when I am looking at raising costs to the town by almost four hundred thousand dollars and I know that my tax base is staying the same and I get the tax assessor coming in saying I've done the form it looks like we can drop everything by a mill as found manager I'm going to say like there's a problem here this is just not right you need to look at it again that never happened nothing was ever said and when the tax assessor found out in April that the mistake had been made the first thing he did was go to the town manager and nothing happened nothing was ever said to anybody so what the town manager did was that instead of addressing the fact that we are now 700 000 in the red well the town manager did is presented the council three budgets that went from anywhere from a million to six hundred thousand dollars more money than what was spent in that year did I do that so the general Council noted having a clue that this is an issue ultimately approved a budget that's spending six hundred thousand dollars more than what we spent in the year before when we were seven hundred thousand dollars short so you had seven hundred thousand and six hundred thousand all of a sudden you're one point three million in the whole this this this has created a couple of ancillary issues other than the obvious ones everything but the I guess the point I want to make right now or the thing that I want to talk about in relation to what I just shared with you is we we spend roughly a 12 a 12 a 12 every month the income that we get is in December January February and then in the beginning of March is about 60 percent of our income comes in those four months so when we're looking at September October November in sometimes part of December we're short of cash so what we do is we go out and we borrow what's called a tax anticipation note now what's important to understand is that this is not new money what this is is that this is money that you're using and Liu getting your taxes and when you get your taxes you pay it off well guess what happened because of over the last two or three budgets because non-recurring incomes plus that shortfall was used to fund recurring expenses we ended up creating unsecured debt at the end of the fiscal year of one million two hundred and seventy five thousand dollars that has to be is scheduled to be paid back this fiscal year and there isn't a single penny budgeted to pay any of it so it's not bad enough that you're going to see a 36 percent increase in your taxes that we all are but now we have to look at how do we get this 1 million two hundred and seventy five thousand dollars paid back and how do you think that works when I'm talking to the bank because I need to borrow I need money for working capital to get me through to December and they're looking at a million dollars they want to know how that's going to get paid back so it's it's just it's not good it really really is it's to me it is just unbelievable I sit in the chair we can do it I mean we can't I feel confident that I can help facilitate to make this happen foreign we're not going to raise taxes anymore I can tell you that I mean what what the goal is the tax rate has to come back down because this is just this is not a place that we need to be but what we need to do is that we need to start reducing our expenses start this year and the budget year that we're in and then when we look at next year's budget there's going to have to be a substantial reduction in the overall cost with hopefully a small decrease in the mill rate and be able to use those extra funds to pay off this debt yeah there are simply no easy or painless answers to this and there are nobody is going to like they're texting when they get it and I I just I'm worried about the people that it's just going to be too much and I'm afraid that we're going to have situations like that and that's one of the things that I want to talk to the council about within our meeting when we start that later um I you know this this has been this has been news for most of the employees the department heads they had no understanding no understanding of where we are it's it is been nerve-wracking and harsh for them because it just creates a level of insecurity and we need good employees to provide the services that we expect what um what I'm asking the community is for your forbearance I I can't I can apologize to the cows come home it isn't fair I know it's not fair I can't do a darn thing about it um but I I just want to promise you that I'm going to do everything I can to get this rectified as soon as we can without with allowing us to maintain the employee base to provide the services um they probably the and you saw this in uh you saw this in giselle's memo that there really has been a terrible lack of transparency and I don't know how you codify that because I've had people say to me how can we make sure this never happens again guys you know we're just going to be on our toes I mean we all do Council has to be um it it bothers me to think that it's our manager would do some of these things uh it purposely hurts the community so I'm asking you for your forbearance I will meet with anybody who wants to talk about this I'll meet with any organization who has questions and concerns suggestions uh I assure you that I will do my part and I guess I'm going to close with that and I'll answer any questions that you folks have tonight damn it here but as I see it we can't put the blame on one person because more than one person was involved in the process of all this happening over the years and so let me I understand what you're saying I I can tell you that I've got so much energy and I get so many hours in the day I really and I we need to understand what happened I really don't want to focus on it I I'm not I don't it's just is is not going to be helpful to the cause we need to be focused on moving ahead I I'm not interested in assigning blame any more than what I've already done I I just think that I think the thing around that mistake the way that was handled was just plain simple it just was and there's no other way to say it and but outside of that I'm just not interested in in going down that road okay I really hope I thank you anybody else nope is it possible to term out that uh 1.3 billion dollars well um we're going to be that there's 275 000 that's owned to the landfill and that's going to get paid when we're done we're going to get that paid we got a million dollar line of credit with guitar so um I I'm working I'm talking with them every day and what I told them is that you know we're going to be moving forward on finding ways to reduce our expenses in this fiscal year that's our goal and so what I told what I told the bank is that we're going to be getting together in April or May and looking at what we can apply to it this year and then figure out um a repayment plan to cover the rest of it I really that debt needs to be it doesn't have to be paid in one year but I also think taxes need to come down so and we need to find a call we need to find a balance in those two things but you know but Banks the bank will definitely work with us they want to get their money yeah and we're going to be paying them interests so as long as they can see a plan and they can feel comfortable with the budget process that we're using and the transparency in the community I think there's no working with us thank you anything else guys well we're going to um we're going to start a regular business meeting you folks are more than welcome to stay around for that if you have questions please don't hesitate to let me know if anybody in my I'll be more than happy to be with you [Applause] thank you Dan it is uh six sixteen we'll go with 6 16 and we'll start this uh meeting order for the record um but uh the record show that all council members are present um at this time if somebody wanted to leave prayer if not all right Matt thank you oh my God we pray for our country at all times that all citizens are safe healthy and happy we pray for wisdom for all those who guide and govern help this government body in every situation to know and to do things that are right and just with soundness of judgment and making vital decisions we pray for the peacemakers that the Holy life-giving Spirit May ever dwell in their hearts and the barriers of fear suspicion and hatred may fall this we pray to the Holy Father amen amen around uh next we'll move into public comment period if anybody has anything to add get out the state your name Mr chair yes I would like to thank the employees at Fort Fairfield for the cards and flowers of my white stream it really meant a lot to me yeah thank you thank you Mitch yes Gary seraway a resident of Fort Fairfield for the last 58 years the native Parable originally anyway I want to congratulate and a foster for stepping up yeah I want to congratulate the Town Council for hiring them major steps in the right direction in my opinion Dan is well known very capable and I wish you well Dan thank you very much you all heard the town's in serious Financial situation gonna need everybody's cooperation to change this that has already hinted at it but I wanted to make sure that department managers even though your budgets have been approved just coming here you don't have to act like the federal government and spend it all okay if there's a way to save some of that money to carry it over into the next year that I implore you to do that I'm not saying I'm not saying that you haven't been doing a good job I'm just saying you're the ones that see what's happening you're the ones that put the warrant out for payment so if you can save somebody that I implore you to do that cash flow problem for the town is very very serious and Dan is working to correct that and we all need to do our part I as a taxpayer would think that some of us who are Nick positioned to pay our tax bill prior to the deadline and help that cash flow we should do it if we can do it that's that much less money he has to borrow I know I'm earning point zero five percent on my second account I'm not getting rich on that deal but and the town that I'm not sure what the rate's going to be on the tax anticipation note but I'm sure it's going to be your interest rates moving up it's going to be an expense that we can alleviate some of it if we all pitch in and do our share by paying what we can if we can't pay the whole thing pay part of it right when we get our tax bill usually the deadline when the infrastructure accumulent is large something first so it's a long period of time and if we had the money to pay for our tax and December or November or January I implore people to do that I I know I plan to do that my tax bill this year there's somewhere around five thousand dollars so it's not a lot of money for this town it's a lot of money for me but I will be in the office to see Ella to make my contribution to tax money the interest rates are rising we all know that that just raised it another 0.75 percent so you know the boring money is going to be more expensive we all know that our credit card bills are going up there are car loan interest rates are going up and the town's anticipation you know is going to go up let's all try to do our part if we can some of us can't and I understand that those of us that can ought to try to make a small contribution towards the capital abroad thank you very much thank you thank you Gary thank you for the opportunity to speak and it's not related to finances and my name is Mitzi McKinney I'm a resident of Fort Fairfield and I love Fort Fairfield and the people here are great and I have a concern and I'd like just to have your um consideration with the situation I'm sure you all know that the dancing divas are coming to the VFW on October October 1st and um I just have a couple considerations for you to think about and I have some handouts but um I we've all heard the word slippery slope and I've dealt with that twice in my personal family myself I worked out in Montana up in Glacier National Park and I hit a slippery slope and I was with a co-worker and we slid all the way down I mean by God's grace we didn't hit a rock and also my son experienced an avalanche while he was out in the Beartooth out in Montana and by the grace of God he did not die and when I say the word slippery slope I feel like that's a potential that we're coming into with our own community and it's my perception I'm hoping to share a little bit of that perception or that angle we all look at things differently but I um first of all I looked up dancing divas and I also uh saw a video that is presented by one of the individuals uh and so I actually took photos from the public demonstration of their ad and I'd like to hand a copy there and a copy there and have it maybe finish with you Kevin that you can collect these but um this is going to be at the VFW and just pass it towards Kevin please foreign I also looked up uh Webster's Dictionary what is lewdness and I actually made you copies and you can pass those both ways and if I can read out loud what lewdness is it's involving or being sexual conduct that is considered indecent or offensive thank you I also looked up Webster's Dictionary for pornography and Webster's Dictionary describes it as the deflection of erotic behavior in pictures or writing intended to cause sexual excitement there's materials such as books or photographs such that depicts erotic behavior and is intended to cause sexual excitement and the depiction of Acts in a central manner as to arouse a quick intense emotional reaction then I know that this is going to be taking place at our VFW and my dad fought in World War II and many went before him and after him many have sacrificed they have died for our country and our freedoms that we're experiencing hereby at this moment and I also looked up our local vfw's motto [Music] and our our motto is Veterans of Foreign more no one does more for veterans therefore no one in your post should feel neglected and I think about a lot of folks who've sacrificed so much for you and I then I looked up the vfw's oath and the vfwo states when a person joins Veterans of Foreign Wars they vow in the presence of almighty God and the members of this order to maintain loyalty to the government of the DFW and to their fellow comrades I also looked up this is the last piece of paper Maybe and so I can take so much time I'll be quick I looked up our core values for the VFW always pick the others the interest of others first treat uh treat donors as partners in our cause promote patriotism and honor our military service ensure the care of our veterans and their families serve our community promote a positive image for the VFW respect the diversity of for a veteran opinions and I'm just wondering if this is uh I don't know if there's an ordinance that would cover I know we have one in our town for pornography and I'd like the council to consider investigating what the the dictionary terminology for all the points in pornography or lewdness promise cutie do we really want to bring this to our community because like I said at the very beginning it could be a slippery slope we don't know what's in route or what's the bottom and is this a standard that we want to now establish for our children and grandchildren and then where does it go from here and I appreciate your time thank you I thank you [Applause] anybody else at this time if not we'll wrap this up go to uh correspondence and reports Dan uh license and permits we have two one for Canterbury Royale and one for the VFW all in favor AI hi thank you um you th Financial reports it's only for two months in terms of things that I would highlight on that one is uh Fire Department uh they they're starting to get regularly in from the DMs uh so as of the end of August it collected 151 thousand dollars I'm not sure how much of that is coming from prior year I think that uh last year the total year was a little over 200 000 I think it's 220 000. I've just seen the final numbers from the other year so that's a good song uh and so I think the thing that we need to look at as a moving forward is what we're going to be looking at on a regular monthly basis that would give us a sense for what we could see on a on for uh uh for a year so I was really pleased to see that uh on the expense side our salaries are a little high um mainly because we hit 5K periods and so in two months it's instead of four so they were the rec department was a little bit higher because they have more programs in the summer so they spend more money on the salaries Public Works is a little lower because they have overtime built into a budget for winter clouds so that all seemed fine uh the only thing that I saw uh outside of that that looked on a line was on our office supplies uh we were a little high on that and the reason is is that they bought all the paper and told them and so outside of that um I think that's really I I guess the other thing is is that for September uh because of our cash flow we couldn't really have a line of credit yet we weren't able to pay the school payment in September so we're working with guitar room and what they'll get rectified hopefully within the week some Chinese food should be also anybody any questions anything that they saw from the financials thank you um C is not here um the uh I did go to my very first uh garbage meeting it's uh I'll tell you it is it's a complicated business there's a lot going on messy business yeah uh they have Martin Vapor does a great job with that organization he's got 14 employees now uh the Prescott landfill is now part of it used to be when I was here Australia Community now is AWS a new state Waste Solutions which is what it's called um and uh they're looking at um working at closing uh the Presque Isle landfill and and they're starting the process of of getting ready to open up to themselves in uh before Fairfield so the uh they're doing very well the fact that now Presque Isle in Fort Fairfield are together they're not competing for garbage so they are able to get a reasonable rate from the surrounding communities so all in all that's working really well uh when the main drug enforcement task force agent this is something that our appreciated to working with us and I think you will share a little bit of information with us good evening again everyone as I think most of us are aware um we have a pretty significant substance use or substance abuse problem in our County specifically in our community so I started dialogue with the Sheriff barusta County they are having an issue with agencies being able to basically lend out people or officers to their main drug enforcement task force the task force is comprised of Agents or officers from different agencies the Sheriff's Office Presque Isle had task force agent at one time Holden State Police border patrol due to some staffing issues they're having a hard time being able to staff those positions I have an officer who's 15 years of experience who's looking for a little bit of a change of scenery from Patrol that he's worked for the last 15 years and this is 100 reimbursement from the state all benefits um wages over time vehicle expenses everything that comes with it is 100 reimbursed from the state um so I'll read down through my memo the main drug enforcement agency aroosted District task force has given the fort Fairfield Police Department the opportunity to provide an officer to become part of their task force this would give the town of Fort Fairfield the opportunity to try to make a larger impact on the drug epidemic that has plagued our community and most other communities in rooster County for some time now being a part of this task force is prestigious and a great opportunity for the police department the officer assigned to the task force in the community as a whole having a task force officer assists with giving our community priority a large-scale drug investigations in our community and offers assistance to our department to try to combat these issues and these issues are significant for us right now the drug issues MDA agents MDA offers specialized training in various facets of the job including evidence collection drafting search warrants and destined meth lab training and working drug informants which is all Collective knowledge that this officer will be able to bring back and share with the officers in our Police Department for Fairfield Police Officers task force agents priority is to the Fort Fairfield Police Department and the town of Fort Fairfield they will advocate for case priority in Fort Fairfield and will work closely with our Patrol officers to deter and solve drug issues the task force agent officer is fully funded by Maine drug enforcement ages 100 reimbursed for wages and any Fringe benefit this will have no cost to the town of Fort Fairfield with Priceless benefits and hopefully Priceless results for our community we're looking for a tentative start date for the officer for mid-november we need a vote just wanted to inform you of what we're trying to do here and some issues we're having in our community that's great Chief how's this going to affect your staff uh right now I have somebody that can can step into that position so it won't affect our staffing on the road I still do have a police officer at the Academy until mid-December but I have a good pool of part-time officers that have really been stepping up to the plate to cover shifts and everybody's been working together to just make sure we have somebody work in the room any questions thank you Matt I just wanted to bring uh I I know that there people are aware of the state has created a program called the property tax stabilization program for senior citizens and I'm thinking like what did God send for senior citizens and forward Fairfield with what we're going through this year unfortunately it doesn't it doesn't in effect this year so it doesn't help us um this is something that um there's there's some and I talked with Tony a little bit about this there's some there's some issues with the program they're already looking at changing it uh it's going to be changing uh every you have to apply for it every year so uh it's there's not going to be any benefit for people to apply for it this year and I just wanted for uh citizens to know that um it may be next year and if it is it can be rest assured that we'll be bringing it up and let you know and that is all we have for correspondence and reports so we'll uh go to new business uh first on the left is the FF FR hardship application and then you've also have seen these before if someone if it's a non-billable call through EMS then there's 100 fee uh for them to respond uh the patient has asset fees away uh in order for that to be considered they have to submit uh uh what their annual income is they fall under the guideline so the recommendation is is that the council approved uh the hundred dollar fee to be way for this particular patient so move second an emotion in a second we'll go for a remote Melissa aye Mitch all right Kevin and I vote I uh uh Jennifer has brought to our attention that the libraries received a gift from the state of Wendell and Barbershop between the 23 557 it's a great gift um in the uh that is going to be utilized and uh create that Shaw Community world and the recommendation is that uh the town except the donation with grateful thanks from from the state of Wendell and Barbara and Nemo in that amount of 43 000 wow second had a motion in a second any discussion it's very generous very yes absolutely all in favor aye okay hi and I voted Hillary Town order 2208 um we are looking at a setting a mill rate of 26.5 and in the middle that came with that um we have underneath the mill rate uh one of the things that this I I spent time talking to Ellen about this because he creates that just to work for her but she is more than willing to do it we have the tax cut now people can pay at 12 and 12 to 12. there are some people are just going to have a hard time with this extra so if if people can come to Ella they can work it out between February March April May and June whatever balance that they haven't paid payments so as far as they will uh forego in the infrastructure so that is one small thing that we can do to help people deal with this uh increase so I would ask the council to approve a new memory of 26.5 I will ask that first emotion you need a motion in a second we had a motion in a second for the new mill rate of 26.5 any discussion foreign all in favor say aye aye aye thank you all very much um as you know prior to me getting on a letter resignation was submitted by our former farmer Chief and I would ask the council to accept that letter of resignation with appreciation for the efforts made by Cody Benson abuse got a motion in a second all in favor say aye all right thank you folks uh the uh we are we are diligently working with a tax anticipation though and we do not have the yeah uh so you have a friend of you uh language I got from the bank today but they're asking the council to vote on and it basically says that counselor moves to allow the teleport Fairfield to borrow from the guitar and Trust Company a load of up to three hundred thousand dollars for five months at an interest rate to be determined for a tax anticipation note also this motion gives Robert Phil Collins chairman and Dan Foster Town manager authorization to sign any required documentation on behalf of the town that would be the motion so it's just so that you and everybody else understands that the request was for 800. not for three this is this is what they think they're willing to do so what that means is is that and this is something that um uh that I think that I can work out is that we have a loan to uh the uh AWS for 275 000 which is due the end of November and what I'm going to request is that uh that we wait until January to pay them I've already talked to Mark Draper he's uh very comfortable with allowing us to do that a meeting with the County Administrator on Friday and I'll be talking to him and the second thing is that normally in October the UK County tax which is 277 000 this year and um I will be letting Ryan know that we will be adopting them so it's we're that's okay we can do that we'll just be paying four percent interest uh on the amount between November 1st and January the cost is inconsequential because we'd be blowing the money anyway whether it's with the county normally we pay those bills one time this year we just can't do it so I would ask the council to make that motion that you see in front of you for a loan of up to three hundred thousand dollars for five months I'll make a motion an emotion in a second to go for load Melissa you want a discussion on this yeah yes the AWS yeah that's not alone that's our normal regular pet Field right it's a little it's a loan it is okay that's one do we know what the interest ring is that we're going to pay for the late payment do we know what the interest rate is on whatever the late payment's going to be it's going to be less than what the banks okay yeah it's uh it's three percent three something okay yep that's anybody else discussion no if not we'll go to vote Melissa aye Mitch Jim aye Kevin hi thank you very much uh I have a few uh house or the things that we need to fix um we got to replace uh Billy Joe and uh Andrea on Intel bank account side as the council to improve that in Dean Foster and Christy and ready to uh signatory an emotion second all in favor on that say aye aye and I would ask the council to appoint Gary Foster as the alternate board member to the AWS in the promotion a lot of motion in a second all in favor say aye aye thank you very much um we've received the Sawmill Trend the snowmobile trail use permit um from George McLaughlin Stormville Club is getting ready to set their Trails uh we have to sign off in a phoenix to South property which is what we do every year so I would ask the council's position to allow me to sell you some more second motion and a second all in favor say aye aye one other thing and boy does it give you great pleasure to bring this up where is look at that yeah this is listen this is deja vu for me because I remember one other time she said I'm done I'm not doing this anymore God loves her she's stepping up she's willing to be the festival chair and it

UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,u7TF-unq87E,"Special Council Meeting August 29, 2022 (1)",,22.0,1341.0,2022-09-02T20:40:06Z,none,188,0,0,0,well yes it is six o'clock we'll call this yesterday as an order for the record of council members um also i want to thank everybody for showing up tonight we've got that all right so we'll uh at this time we'll go to public comment period if anybody has anything to say i think i would like to just mr question i think may i say say something for a second absolutely i would uh last week uh the council meeting with but i would like to apologize to all council members and i'm here for the rest of my time thank you hey dan that's all i needed thank you sir well listen i i appreciate the opportunity to speak to you guys you all know who i am you all know me pretty well melissa do not even have a chance i can put it harder than i am but all these guys know me quite well um you know it has never ever been my intent to ever get involved in another administration i just never thought it was appropriate everybody does things differently and it far be it from me to questioning andrea what she's doing or things i didn't understand but i i i am feeling compelled to speak and um i'll try to keep it brief um but i really do have some concerns and now that andrea is moving on and she has another position i feel more comfortable in in addressing the council i certainly have i've been approached zillions of times i can't wear the store get a little bread of somebody asking me something about what's going on um and i don't know what all is going on i can always surmise based on limited information that i have so if there's some thoughts that i am sharing that are not accurate i'm sure somebody will correct me and that's perfectly fine and appropriate my understanding is that tonight you guys are going to appoint an interim town manager it's also my understanding that andrea feels pretty strong that it should be the gentleman from public works here i don't know darren i'm sure he's a great guy when gene conway got done back in 1998 the town council um appointed ian shaw who was the town clerk and ian did a great job what she did was maintain status quo which is what somebody some of it somebody normally in that position does i honestly feel status quo is not going to cut it i don't feel comfortable with that i don't have anything against darren i'm sure he's a great guy i've had a number of people ask me if i would be willing to serve as interim town manager and i am i can tell u5 that if for some reason felt that i could be helpful in that process i am willing to talk to you about it let me tell you why um why you might want to consider me is that i've been a lifelong resident of fort fairfield i'm born here like a lot of you and and grew up here went away for college and i went away six years to florida after i retired which i enjoyed but i've been back in fort fairfield since colby more and more primarily because of my mother who by the way is 93 today i want to let you know which means i could be around for a while and i have my parents home after months upon which i thoroughly love and i decided that this is where i want to be darlene and i talked about that and we're working through that but i changed my residency back to fort fairfield i'm a state state of maine resident now and happy to pay state of maine income taxes um i think i'm well known in the community primarily because i spent 15 years here as town manager and i was visible and active not everybody agreed with me and i certainly did not do everything right but i can tell you my heart and soul was in it and i absolutely loved it it was a great job and i think that those experiences that i had in the relationships that i have in this community can help in the transition that's going to be needed between andrew andreas tenure as manager and whoever our next manager is going to be one of the concerns that i have is that some of these some of the issues that i'm really concerned about i think could really inhibit good quality people from wanting to apply somebody does not want to come into a situation and bank their career on an environment that they don't see is stable friendly community oriented and i think that there are some concerns here um with that type of environment that we're in right now and i i want to be able to help facilitate getting us back on an even keel and which i hope will increase the quality of candidates that will be interested in coming to fort fairfield and work with us as our next town manager so a few of the things that i'm really concerned about one is is that you folks have adopted a budget and in three short weeks you're going to set a mill rate based on that budget and you know our last taxes uh you know people a lot of people saw a hefty increase a lot of it was because of the rebound but there were people who saw decreases because of the rebound but there was also increases in expenses that contributed to that what they're going to see this year if you adopt if you set a mill rate that is consistent with the budget that you adopted is you're going to see almost six mills on an increase that's a third people are going to be paying a third more than what they did and that was that would be one thing if that was it if i said okay we're square we're even there's no other problems but that's not it it just doesn't still does not cover all the expenses as i understand them and i see us getting stuck into this constantly going round and round where taxes are going to continue to be continue to be increased the reason for the shortfall is not and i just got to say this because i've had so many people say to me well if it wasn't for the school budget i don't know where in god's name that ever came from well let me tell you something it's not because of the school budget the school over the last five years has gone up 5.8 the town's expenses have gone up 89 wow that is unsustainable that's not something that we can continue to do and you know what the weird thing is about this whole thing is that the shortfall that you have in this year's budget is 1 million 245 000 dollars that's the shortfall that you're gonna make up do you know which of that is actual increase in expenses in the town budget it's less than half your expenses have only increased by six hundred thousand dollars but yeah you have a shortfall of one million two hundred and forty five why why is that now there can be lots of reasons but in my mind a fundamental reason for how this has happened is that for whatever reason you folks are using non-recurring income to fund recurring expenses and that this thing is just has just been we've been multiplying in this process has got to start [Music] one of the one of the issues along with this that really concerns me is you have the town has about 2.2 million dollars in long-term debt and that based on what i understand generates about 340 000 dollars of annual payments now i looked at the budget that you folks adopted i don't see that 340 000 anywhere now maybe built into one of those accounts that are on the expense side but basically you have a budget that's 100 income here and 100 expenses here there's no i don't see that 340 000 and if that's not built into that budget where is that money coming from on top of that you have 1 million seventy five thousand dollars in short term debt so what i see is a one million dollar loan that's a tan a tax anticipation note a tax anticipation note is not new money it is not money that you can just spend what that one million dollars is is that that money is given to you because you receive all your property taxes clumped together in three or four months so when you get that million dollars you pay down your expenses for september october november into december and then all of a sudden your tax money comes in and you take that tax money and you pay that million dollars back but you didn't do it so that's no longer tax anticipation no that is simply a debt that the town owns which comes due in this fiscal year so what i'm looking at in this fiscal year i'm looking at a shortfall of one million two hundred forty five thousand dollars which we're going to make up with a six meal increase but i'm looking at this other hunt one million six hundred thousand dollars that's going to be accounted for somehow and it technically it these it's supposed to be taken care of this fiscal year which is just not practical that's another eight or nine meals and you know obviously that's not going to happen it needs to be resolved you know on top of that the other issue that i'm really concerned about is cash flow my sense is now i don't know this but my sense is that the town doesn't have any money for very very little now it never did when i was a town manager by the time august and september rolled around i was coming to you folks and i was asking for a tax tax anticipation note so that would carry us through until january or february to um to pay our bills and so right now we don't retire and trust a million dollars on tax anticipation note from last year and maybe partly from the year before i don't know and you're going to go back and ask for more now and when i was real young i used to be a banker and that's actually the very same thing that you just said we just took another tax anticipation that we will pay back again so that a million dollars is in the bank that we have that cash no we're paying down debt just like you just said that you did when you were town manager it's the same thing nothing's changed what's changed is that you ultimately know but the million dollars i take it that that his introduction and where he's going at is is uh coming to a close i'm sure okay i'm trying all right help you carry on thank you i'm thinking that we owe this money and there is no cash in the bank right now so there's going to have to be another one now maybe maybe there is cash but the last financial statement that i saw for whatever it is you provide financial things it showed cash balance so is it a line of credit the tax anticipation now is it new knowledge is a line of credit or is it just a loan per million dollars it's a normal tax anticipation it's no different than when you were here you did taxes well when i did it was a line of credit so it didn't necessarily mean that one could have been used out you would like to come in and talk to me during regular clients about this i'd be happy to do that we have business to conduct the council no no yeah i'm part of that anyway concerned about cash flow i'm also concerned about our employees i think you know this has been disruptive i know that you folks have been upset employees are upset you know employees are the ones that they're they're the ones that carry the loan and they're the ones that do the work and i can tell you none of this is their fault none of it and um you know i think this is hard on employees emotionally and i think that the transition is not necessarily going to be easy for some of you and i think employees need to be treated with respect and with due diligence and the last thing that i'm concerned about is community um you know people are discouraged people are upset people don't understand and there's still a lot of information out there i believe that there needs to be a whole lot more transparency for the community to be aware of exactly where we are and what we're going to need to do to get through this um you know we use words like community town municipality but honestly guys it's about people why in god's name when i want to break up what has been a great retirement out there the medicine pawn to come in and get sassed by mitch now why would i want to do that those 15 years that i spent as town manager was the most emotionally gratifying job i have ever had and it's because of the people and i and i have been asked by a number of people would you please consider helping us so i'm saying to you folks i'm willing to help i think i can and i would just simply ask for your serious consideration thank you mr foster yes but you said i asked you i mean i don't think i did oh my [Laughter] you're yes key words that dan foster i'm sorry gary sierra long-term resident not a native only 58 years but i'm a long-term resident served on the council served as chairman for two years and many other functions my concern here is transparency number one we haven't had transparency with this council a lot of us out in the field don't really know what's going on because it's not public it's not posted it's not information that we can get that hold up the other thing i want to say i'll be very brief i don't think we should continue but the policies that we've had under andrea powers and i don't no disrespect angry it's a little link to that now but we need a new broom sweeper and pudding and again no disrespect to we need a new groom and i think that's the time this is the time for you as a council to select a new room to start the process of healing this community this community is reeling not only because of the proposed tax increase that's coming i'm not sure when the tax bills are coming out but this fall but that's not the end of it as dan alluded to there's more coming next year and i i cringe when i think about how we're going to handle that using the same philosophy using the same room that we've been using right along i think we need a new room and i totally endorse your selection of dan foster as interim town manager thank you thank you anybody else if not next we'll uh have a motion to move into mrsa 405 personal matter get a motion in a second all in favor we've got to sneak into executive session folks oh [Music] nice,True

that all citizens are safe healthy and happy we pray for wisdom for all those who guide and govern help this government body in every situation to know and to do the things that are right and just with soundness of judgment and making vital decisions we pray for the peacemakers that the Holy life-giving Spirit May ever dwell in their hearts and the barriers of fear suspicion and hatred may fall this we pray in the Holy Father amen and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty thank you next we'll go to uh public comment period if anybody has anything to uh say state your name and uh approach to your Podium please oh why are you so nervous up here her name's Ken Stratton I'm a resident of foreign Fairfield this past spring several groups here in town it used to meet at the local library we're told that we could no longer meet there due to an insurance company requiring that a staff member to be present I understand that this is beyond the librarian's control it's an insurance requirement but this got me thinking our library hours are 10 to 5 30 4 days a week close on Sundays and Mondays it opened on Saturdays from 10 to 4. hahaha because our average citizen working nine to five jobs their only opportunity to use the libraries on Saturdays who wants to do work related research on a Saturday I wouldn't wouldn't it be better to have the library open from 12 noon to 7 30 pm so those that work nine to five appeal to use it this would also solve the issue of the group stuff being able to meet in the basement so I'm just asking the town how to consider changing Library hours though we wouldn't have to hire the additional staff to man that at night thank you Ken anybody else like tell me a comment I'm going to do it from here because I want I don't like to usually speak up or say a whole lot um but I feel like I've bit my tongue for long enough so it's time for me to say how I feel and I thought that maybe I should do it as a citizen instead of as a counselor so that's why I thought maybe I should come over here to do it I wrote it down just so I don't forget anything so uh basically I just want to take a moment to address some issues that I'm having with how the council has been operating basically I'm noticing that during the meetings not much input is being shared by the Council on different items that we're discussing biggest of those are the budget advisory committee and the budget itself so basically what I'm seeing is each month we're kind of sitting here going through the motions but very little is being said in regards to how we feel about the process or what we think we can do to fix or change things um I don't think that a lot of direction is given to the town manager I don't think a lot of directions given to her staff um it's just not a very productive way to conduct Town business and it's not a very productive Council when we're working like that so I think that we should be working together with our town manager with our department heads and I think that that's what we're voted into these seats to do uh the town manager and her staff bring the council information that's necessary for the council to make informed decisions the council shares our citizens voices brings the ideas to the table and works with the town manager and staff um 20 years that might arise it's then our job to make our best informed decision on behalf of the town and the citizens and yes it is nerve-wracking from this side just saying so I'm sorry I'm nervous um but I just I really like this has been weighing on me and it's this business stuff is easy for me this stuff is not so um my question to the council is if our business isn't being conducted at the council meetings then where is it being conducted um I understand it's part of our job as counselors to go outside of these walls to talk to our taxpayers to do research to talk to town managers department heads to whoever we need to talk to in order to get the information that we need to make decisions however it's my belief again my mind alone uh possibly others I don't know but it is my belief that there's a lot more work going on outside of the meetings than in Council and I don't think that that's productive I think that if we're doing all of this work and researching and getting all of this information and we're not bringing it to Council meetings and sharing it then what are we doing it for um I think we need to learn to communicate better and I think that if there is stuff going on in outside meetings and you're not sharing it then you probably need to take a look at yourself and your efforts as a counselor and see if those are the best efforts and for the good of the Town um and is look and see if you are actually being productive I think that we should all be working for the taxpayers for the good of the Town citizens um and not working just behind closed doors but also working during our meetings as well another issue that is really kind of the reason that I brought this up is that uh I find that with this console there's a lot of false and inaccurate news being spread um some of it's from the council some of it's from and that's not necessarily just this year that's been for a couple of years we've had a little bit of that issue but it's being spread in it and I found that there was something in the paper recently that made me bring that up uh counselor roulette said that we voted on a budget before we had seen the figures now I that's not accurate we sat here for multiple meetings and reviewed the figures with the department heads um so I'm not sure what figures we voted on that we didn't see but we did actually meet on March 10th April 28th May 5th May 18th June 1st June 9th June 15th and June 29th after we voted on the budget which was not the requested amount the town manager and the department heads have to go back and figure out what they're going to do with a lower amount than what was originally requested so they have to reallocate the funds remove the items that were not funded um and then the council votes on the budget as a whole we don't vote on the line items of the budget we review them with the department heads the town manager works with the department heads to figure out if those line of line items are what should be in there um so basically my recommendation would be if you don't understand the process first learn the process and if you're not conducting yourself on behalf of the town then you're not being a productive Council your what we should be doing is just for the good of the town for the taxpayers sure there should be no personal agendas there shouldn't be any backdoor meetings so I just hope going forward that we can be more productive and I just kind of need to get that off my chest so that's it thank you anybody else if not we'll move on to correspondence and reports of Lions Club recommendation is that Council approve and sign this license application remove second got a motion this second and go for a vote Melissa hi Matt hi Jim hi Kevin hi and I vote I mean next we'll go to financial and reports um and real estate Revenue sharing and then 30-day notices through excise collected in July was 93 815.41 compared to last year at 111 757.33 we are down seventeen thousand nine hundred forty one dollars and ninety two cents this decrease may be caused by the state of Maine giving an exemption to disabled veterans as of 7 31 2022 uncollected real estate taxes for 2021 was 210 159.26 the amount due for 2020 taxes for that same period last year was 150 841.09 a difference of fifty nine thousand three hundred eighteen dollars and Seventeen cents we received July Revenue sharing in the amount of 105 800.81 on 721 2022. total revenue sharing received to date is 105 800.89 we are thirty thousand three hundred and Seventeen dollars over the budget is amount we have received from your community on 8 8 2022 we sent out 138 million notices for a total of 144 469.78 last year we sent out 165 notices for a total of 143 334.70 as of 8 17 2022 we have collected on 23 accounts for a total collected of 26 644.55 this leaves a balance of ninety seven thousand eight hundred twenty five dollars and twenty three cents uncollected taxpayers have until September 8 2022 to pay before liens are placed for the same period last year we had a total of one hundred and thirty thousand one hundred forty three dollars and twelve cents uncollected foreign took place over the last two months he said our contract income was down by five percent in July it's normally down some in the summertime but our unit date is up at 10 so we're in line with our budgets our expenses are down we're actually over in our expenses by five percent right now and that continues to be a leachate problem uh with tonight's rain coming in last week's rain coming you can bet that expense is going to keep going up um and I'll always remind you that somewhere down the line we should really be looking at how we can submit it meet you to come before it figures Utility District rather than giving a all the caribou and that's really a part that we'd have to play with Utilities District in the landfill to make that happen I think this year as of July we've spent more in reaching than we did all of last year 2007 thousand dollars so there were no other no other options that came up nothing like EP racing but we'll certainly get from filled in Friday if there's any other questions uh or anything you want me to bring today through the legion going to Caribou how's it going to Caribou and we're talking about going to our Utilities District we'd have to put a pipeline in and we've done we've done a little bit of research on that okay from you from our site at the landfill uh we proposed it three years ago yeah yeah and we've done some research we've done some engineering to show three different routes for the pipes to come but with this new facility across the river and then a lot easier to Denali for uh it depends on the run you take before although we did talk to John when we were looking at this to make sure that the underwater certainly something they're interested in doing it I know John is right up because I lost the product he was in tonight but just to remind us that we should be looking to head down the line because and you can touch your grants or anything like that or anything like the Caribou will pay for the running the pipes are good uh we get a grant from the dep it's almost likely if we ran up this way was based on us not having to truck it which was an issue now that we have the pipeline there we may not be as eager to able to get some stuff from DP and second time around uh but if we show that we're trying to be uh careful about being conscientious about what would happen if we overdo the utilities to be careful we can shift it here in equal out where that gets put into the river that may be another whole option again Republicans so but uh we can do some further research on that and I'll bring that up to a price meeting it's true you know where it might be interested okay okay thank you Steve oh next we'll go to Old business a public hearing was held for the ordinance 22-02 an ordinance providing for rewarding of the budget advisory Community ordinance 22-02 in the council chambers of the fort Fairfield Municipal building on August 10 2022 at 6 PM there was one citizen that spoke against the ordinance changes there were two citizens that spoke for the ordinance changes and there were three citizens that spoke neither for or against the public hearing the town manager's office did not receive any emails and or additional letters or any other forms of communication from citizens from August 10th 2022 to August 17 2022 regarding these proposed changes an ordinance providing for rewarding to the budget advisory committee ordinance 22-04 the recommendation is that Town Council does approve the ordinance 2202 an ordinance providing for rewarding to the budget advisory committee ordinance 2202 as written Mr chair I make a recommendation most of them make the recommendation that we approve orders 2220 with that emotion in a second we'll have discussion no discussion we'll go for both Melissa hi Matt hi Kim foreign new business we've got Public Works currently uses an mt4 tracklist is a backup to the mt5 track the sidewalk plow as well as this other machine was used primarily in the summer to compact hot top during the passion process during recent patching operations the mt4 track has developed transmission issues that would cost more to repair if the machine is worth the recommendation from the public works director is that Town Council authorized Public Works to use about more than twenty thousand dollars from the public works Reserve account g1-3064-00 to purchase a used Trappist sidewalk club and I'm not even going to begin to as you know what that means so I will ask the public works for enter to share that information basically the mt4 was the first real sidewalk plow we had if you guys remember we had an old John Deere tractor that uh was really a nightmare and we just moved up Leaps and Bounds when we bought that first track let's see what it'll do and how it does it um we actually traded a V plow that was sitting at the old walk that first track was um and we do the tracklist probably wasn't a long-term deal but we did get five years of it but one thing that we got out of that machine is a ten thousand dollar snowblower that will spit on a brand new tracklist today and we can't we can't go up and uh purchase a new tractors they're 160 000 but we've uh we've found several uh look to be good quality used ones and we'd like to travel but when we travel we'd like to be able to purchase one that we if we're able to find the right ones and they're all less than you know twenty thousand dollars 160 for a brand new one um there you look at them going on the sidewalk and the size of the machine and it's hard to believe that they cost that much money but when you when you realize what you can do with them they like to switch Swiss army knife we have a grinder head that we purchased relatively reasonable for one so we can go do joints and sidewalks joints and driveways for repairs and whatnot so they'll really do a lot that little machine weighs as much as a three-quarter ton pickup and it has 120 horsepower so they're really they're really amazing um we we use it thank God we have and the days of walking along and throwing patch out in the hole you guys have seen our roads I mean it would be impossible to get through if we didn't have that machine to compact the pot that we use a daily basis just to keep our roads fast so what we're looking for is is we would buy a newer one the one that we have it was manufactured in the in the 90s we're looking at one that's from the early 2000s we would make the early 2000s on The Power Team and the other one and I've seen myself the years I was on Main Street the amount of work that that has done and and I've seen many times the the repair truck following that up and down the streets and we're looking at a bit and and I uh I'm not surprised you got the use out of it that you did I was too like I said we we probably got us the engine still runs good if we could repair if we would but uh it's just Cost whatever at this point it will become a partial machine that there's still a lot of parts machines on top of that so there's still money uh yes um it has an hour meter but it's been replaced about three times before we got it but I I think since we've we've had it it's uh it's up there you know like 1200 hours when it goes in the summer when it goes out passing per day it goes for 10 hours you put a vibratory roller on it I mean they really arguments any questions nope thank you Darren Mr chair I'll make a motion we authorized public works so don't use more than twenty thousand dollars from the public works Reserve account purchase a used practice sidewalk plow we had a motion in a second and go for a vote Melissa hi Mitch and I will die next we got the police department Cruiser bids 2013 2022 at 12 p.m contract needed Supply deputy chief Cody Fenderson and chief Cummings opened the four bids that were received on the cruise the bids were as follows correct Patty 1268.18 Curtis Sealy two thousand one hundred fifty dollars Lori Hodgson 2 251.13 and Calvin korsman one thousand fifty dollars recommendation it is the chief's recommendation that the town approved the high bid by Lori Hodson of 2 251.13 provide Hudson with the title and a bill of sale upon payments the 2 251.13 will be placed at the police department equipment purchase maintenance line e-01-03-30-05 foreign next we got the fire department ambulance fee waiver request so this is our first one we've talked about this um I believe three months ago that this may happen at some point in time so that's the very first one so we are trying to get through this again we've done a bit of research on what we need to do and we're pretty sure this is how we do this so um on August 14 2022 uh at kingfire Chief Cody Fenderson received notification from Comstock ambulance billing that we have received a hardship application this patient is a resident of Fort Fairfield and income in less than the standardized annual guidelines of 27 180 to be considered for hardship the patient was not transported by The Animals they received a 100 non-transport fee for the assessment and care provided on scene as is standard for all no transporting costs their insurance does not cover no transports and they are requesting a balance of a hundred dollars be waived Council will need to determine if they wish to continue to seek 400 that is due or if they would like to Grant the hardship waiver in my pocket make a motion we prove the waiver and Grant themselves actually yeah second we had a motion in a second any discussion if not we'll go for vote Melissa all right Mitch hi Jim hi Kevin hi and I will die next we got the county proposal for change of facial year University County Commissioners will be holding a public meeting on November 16th at 1 pm at the Caribou Courthouse to discuss the process and hear comments from municipalities on the proposal to change their fiscal year the county develops three budget proposals general fund jail budget and unorganized territory budget while the jail and unorganized territory budgets are on a July to June fiscal year the general fund budget has remained on a calendar January to December here this requires their budget process to begin in early summer and conclude in late fall to accommodate adopted budgets before year end municipalities typically receive their County tax bill in February March and by state statutes are required to pay the county tax by September 1st with interest beginning to accrue after November 1st this creates a cash flow problem that requires the county to borrow funds and anticipation of taxes and further increases the amount of County tax necessary to collect from each of the media the County Commissioners will be discussing the options of changing their fiscal year the timeline involved the impact that such a change will have on their budget process as well as the impact the municipalities through the first year of that change the County Commissioners are open to ideas and suggestions from the municipalities and invite and encourage participation at this meeting the meeting will also be available via Zoom how is that going to affect our budgets or them there's discussing it I wouldn't I don't know but I would encourage attending that meeting to find out how it will affect uh generally they would have to send out an 18 like 18-month billing so an additional half year it's going but I'm not certain until then we'll know more after November 16th but I would encourage Council to attend for um get on the same list so we can watch it and if you have Comics questions or concerns you'll be able to address that with the commissioners next we got the minutes of July 20th 2022 regular council meeting in the minutes of August 10 2022 in the public hearing from an ordinance 22-02 Mr chair make a motion accept the minutes as written our second we had a motion in a second any discussion um I don't think it's already uh Courier was present at that meeting I'm assuming that on the minutes the meetings that you're saying that he was president [Music] congratulations that was the information corrected it already so they'll have to be a correction verifying the difference well if if you've already made the motion you I can suggest that you just with the corrections right that's yeah add with the corrections to the minutes Mr chair I'll make a motion that we've got the minutes with uh with the the uh discussed Corrections second I had a motion and a second any discussion we'll go from well Melissa aye Mitch Kevin and I will die next we got warrants number two and number three on the amount stated we're at number two in the amount of two three twenty two this amount included sat 20 payments in the amount of 183 619.25 warrant number three in the amount of 402 517.96 was completed on 804 2022 this included this amount included sat 20 payment in the amount of 183 619.25 I make a motion we approved warrants number two and three as written it's accepting that motion I got a motion in a second any discussion on that if not we'll go for both Melissa all right all right again Kevin hi and I will die all right next we'll uh go to other yep I have some Department guys who have some information to share with Council okay good evening Council um I wanted to share with you uh some of the work that the officers of the fort Fairfield Police Department have done since the beginning of 2022. I think it's important that we keep you updated regularly on on our efforts and the efforts of our officers for the first time since 2020 I'm proud to report uh that since May we are fully staffed with three full-time officers plus myself and six part-time officers who work on an as needed basis to assist with covering open shifts and vacations it was essential for us to hire this many part-time officers in this manner because they all work full-time jobs and have limited availability the part-time officers save us on overtime that would normally be back filled by full-time officers on on Monday August 14 officer Isaac wickerman who some of you have met I started a base a 42nd basic law enforcement training program I heard through the grapevine that he was chosen as a class leader out of the 70 cadets for the first week officer Workman will graduate on December 18 and this will give us a fully certified crew of full-time officers this makes us short-handed while officer whipperman graduates but I've been utilizing our part-time officers as much as possible to fill in the gaps we are still currently in the academy waiver process for officer Lance Ferguson our third and final full-time officer for full-time who had a full-time certification out of Tennessee the academy Board of Trustees will likely approve his full-time certification here in Maine in September at their next board meeting with a couple of main conversion courses officer Ferguson comes with uh comes to us with numerized numerous specialized trainings he has received out of state and he's been a good fit for us here at the police department so far this year we have responded to 1497 calls for service these calls for service range in severity from domestic violence assaults strangulations threatening stalking drug arrests rapes child abuse elder abuse aggravated assaults robbery thefts burglaries assault on law enforcement assault on EMS and mental health related calls we have over 60 criminal arrests and prosecutions so far this year not including warrant requests and arrests we feel numerous traffic complaints and conduct traffic enforcement as time permits between calls for service it is common misconception that once we have left a call we are done with it the paperwork that follows these calls can be extensive and takes a lot of time to complete our officers are busy and they do their best to feel these complaints in a timely manner and do their best by those in our community we find the majority of the calls lately have prompted a two-person response as those we are dealing with are under the influence of a substance and seem to be ever more aggressive towards law enforcement uh this has been problematic for us as other local agencies such as the state police sheriff's office and border patrol are all short-handed and sometimes do not have anyone to assist us normally they do sometimes they don't we've had to call out a second for Fairfield Police Officer to assist with these calls at times which can adversely affect the overtime line uh worth it for the safety because the safety of our officers is Paramount we recently received a 2017 Ford Explorer SUV which is fully equipped with radio lights siren laptop stand which will be used to replace our station spare for tourists which is being used to travel to the academy by Officer whipperman we were able to obtain this Cruiser from the sheriff's office at no cost of the town of Fort Fairfield it's brown public works with painted white there should be service us for a couple of years and will be a reliable spare for us um although it has high mileage it is in great shape and I would like to thank Sheriff Shawn dealing for seeing the need Sean Gillen for seeing the need and helping us out budgets are tight and we're doing what we can to hold the line on this I estimate the value of the cruise and the equipment to be about twelve thousand dollars we continue to deal with overcrowding at the jail the jail has been holding a population of about 40 more inmates in their maximum capacity for a while now and we are limited in what we can take down to the jail due to the overcrowding we're also dealing with the lack of services for those suffering from mental health mental illness and Trauma we find that we often transport people from mental health evaluation to local hospitals which in turn involuntary commits or blue paper these individuals they often sit in the ER for three to five days because of the lack of bed space and more availability Statewide for inpatient care are they are then released back into the community starting the cycle over again I would like to thank the town manager of the Town Council and the citizens of the town of Fort Fairfield for the continued support of the police department as always if there are any questions comments or concerns I'm available to address these thank you thank you thank you [Music] uh Public Works biggest issue here in the recent past has been Staffing and one of the biggest reasons why we were light on Staffing was burnout throughout the winter season we were working seven days a week it's been constant we've all seen the changes in the weather patterns the wind the freezing rain everything um one good thing about that is we're seeing more frequent storms with smaller storms you didn't see a storm over six clouds six seven inches last year um so we we've come up with a good way to you know alleviate that issue and by the way we've been fortunate enough that we have restaffed with with some really good quality people that have Public Works experience one of them comes from uh he was a former employee in Fort Fairfield Public Works and two of them are from another town in their public service departments we've been really fortunate that way and we have a couple more potential employees one of them is a mechanic which we saw a Master Mechanic you know um anyway moving forward this is what we plan to do throughout the winter months from the end of November until the end of March we're going to go to a seven day a week Staffing and what we're going to do is we're going to run seven ten hour days basically three and a Half Men on one crew three and a Half Men on the other will be three pull timers and a part-timer that'll be on call um you'll have a smaller amount of Staffing but what that will do is that allows another three guys to probably at least get two of those three days that they're on um and three guys potentially four can run around and take care of the majority of the issues that we have on a weekend which is drifting that sort of thing if you have a major event call in the other three guys so you you're fully staffed on that major event so you I am I am 100 sure that the taxpayer support Fairfield are going to see better service out of this and we're going to save one overdone any questions it's Sherwood and that has become a more difficult no I think that's a great note so if anybody can see any flaws in that plan we'd love to hear them I thought it through we thought it through inside out over several months and I can't see any it's going to take some planning it's going to put some work on myself and the deputy director part but yes sir Juan crew will work Wednesday through Saturday one crew works Sunday through Wednesday Wednesday will be an overlap day where we automatically have the old crew any big bigger projects like cleaning up ditches with the loaders and whatnot we'll try to pull down on that day and that Local app will allow the other guys to get their 40 in right that's correct everybody will get a minimum before we get there yeah can you just have a snowstorm adjusted on Wednesday too I would love to we could be all cleaned up by Friday yeah I'm really looking forward to it I haven't looked forward to a winner 25 years yeah thanks thank you Darren anything else oh sorry about that so um I wanted to touch base again on the excise tax that we collect um so because the state of Maine is giving an exemption to disabled veterans we are losing a big amount um of money I mean 17 941.92 I know that cleans in in comparison to our entire budget that does seem like pennies however um in my department that's a lot for us to lose out on so I understand it's a great thing um to give to disabled veterans and on all for it it's a great thing that the state is doing but it is at our expense yeah so that wasn't nice it's too bad the steak couldn't communities for what they'd be losing right especially for small towns like us I mean for big cities you know Portland OR Augusta that's not going to bother them right but just think how much bigger the amount will be true yeah so I don't know well hopefully they may Envision something somewhere along the next you know even two three four months six months that may compensate that hopefully yeah after they get the numbers in to see what the effects are in all these communities but with Revenue sharing me into thirty thousand dollars more I know we can't depend on Revenue sharing but at least that'll help take low points out of it yeah because it's right now it looks I mean I understand you're well your thing but we got revenue shares up a little bit so hopefully it'll help adjust which right so now um this year we're going to try something new with collections um the town has always hand counted local balance and this year we're going to we're going to order ballots from the same company that prints the balance for the state so there won't be any more hand Counting this year anyway we'll see how it goes um so we won't have to count both by hand and having the tabulator count the votes will make the count more accurate and it will take less time my time and volunteer time because we all know how hard it is to find volunteers um so with this being in November gubernatorial election and a local election for two counselors and one School Board member it's expected that we will have more voters come in than we did in June or even at the last November election so with that being said I plan on hiring five election clerks to help me during the election and if anybody here would love to join me um call the town office and leave us your name and phone number and we'll get back to you about that yes and I'm still going to use staff that we can um it all depends on if we plan to keep the office open or not I think it's a good idea to keep the office open because we did still get business in so that would be a good idea to do so I think yeah yeah we have a list okay well it's not really it's not really applying just yeah so just call the office and we'll look at our list and see what we can do because we do need and want to have more people involved it's a good deal like today thank you thank you thank you all for letting me uh give you an update on how we're doing over here 2022 continues to be a much busier year than 2021 so far this year we've had a total of 452 EMS calls and 122 non-ems calls for a total of 574 calls for service for the same period in 2021 we had 358 EMS calls and 83 non-ems calls for a total of 441. 133 more calls this year than last in addition to our call store service we continue to work on our weekly trainings with both paid call and Courier staff we are currently hosting a firefighter one and two program with members participating from Easton and Washburn fire departments as well this course is scheduled to be completed in early November we continue to incorporate legally departments and trainings whenever possible especially with Easton as their automatic Mutual intent in addition to our fire training we continue to work on our EMS training all of our career staff is enrolled in taking courses to advance their EMS licenses we continue to host the EMS continuing education training in-house at least once a month to maintain our EMS skills and we've partnered with the U.S border parole and Homeland Security investigations to train collaboratively and share resources to maintain and increase our EMS skills we are seeing great improvement in our reimbursement from medical billing Since switching our service to compost our medical billing I communicate with them on a weekly basis and their customer support is second to none uh in the month of July we received a 102 761.52 worth of reimbursement this month's uh as of this morning we have received 32 370 and 11 cents so this brings our total collection Since switching to them at the beginning of uh July to 135 131.63 and they are continuing to work with us to recuperate some of the money that main building should have built but I did not uh Staffing continues to be a large concern for our department in the last month we have lost three career members and three called paid call Members with increasing call volume this is a very serious concern uh we have posted the career positions which we're all budgeted for and the budget that we presented but have received zero applications I have been working diligently to recruit members for the pay call Department specifically those that live in our town that's it some success but if again any of you would love to come and work with us on a pay-call basis you we can train it don't worry about that uh we continue to have extremely limited pay call response to emergencies that occur during the week and during the daytime hours due to members having other jobs and other responsibilities while staffing has continued to be great concern we continue to respond to emergencies and work with our mutual Aid Partners to achieve the best outcomes within the last five days we even responded to do two different fires that were stopped from causing serious damage because of Fast Response by our extremely limited Crews another major concern for the Department is fire apparatus Readiness status we recently received pump magnets on both of our engines from K T Fire Equipment while both engines require significant repairs both fire pumps have been deemed to be serviceable there are numerous other issues that we will need to continue to work on getting corrected on the chassis to ensure that they are safe to operate these repairs are estimated to be costly as there are no replacement parts being manufactured for these vehicles the compressed air foam systems and the onboard air generators on both of the engines are out of service the cost to repair this system on one truck it is is in excess of fifteen thousand dollars and that's how much it costs 10 years ago when kmt did their last repair of this type of system uh and that is because again those parts are no longer being manufactured both engines in the towers were pump tested today and they passed their pump tests so all the fire pumps are certified for another year of service I am currently working on granite applications for several different areas we are looking for grant funding to create and improve the fire training area the old Public Works area this area would include a fire training building fire training props an area for vehicle and hose training as well as classroom area this area would be usable for all police buyer and EMS both in our town and our other local agencies so we can learn to work better together we're also working on a grant to inland fisheries and wildlife for an update and rescue site that can be used both in the winter and summer for harder to reach patients and I plan to reapply for the fortune Grant we were awarded last year the matching the grant and as always I continue to look for any opportunity for fire truck replacement or Improvement Grants we recognize that our department has been the center of attention in town for some time now and I understand the reasons that may have some frustrated with the situation we are working towards providing the fire and EMS service to the Fort Fairfield needs while attempting to find ways to lower the tax burden to our citizens if you have any questions so um a couple minutes back we've mentioned that uh we've gone over the period of time building time building cycles and some of that it's a lot of that wasn't going to be paid because it went over and you were digging into that to see where that was where that was at have you heard anything back I haven't heard any more since the last time we talked we haven't had any more blatant refusals since then so that's that's a good sign um but they they Continue to update me uh once a week they go and build all the new things and usually during that process is when they send me updates on anything that's been refused or isn't going to be and I haven't had any more since the last time we talked about it that's uh there were two that were about a thousand dollars or twelve hundred dollars uh just in one day so I I don't know the exact total of all of the ones that we've received so far as they are keeping a list of that and then in about a month or so they should have a pretty good idea of what's going to be paid and what's not going to be uh so as I think I mentioned last time some of the insurance companies will straight up say no we don't have to pay like the federal government of the federal insurances they say no we're not going to pay some of the private insurance companies say no we're not going to pay and then Comstar can submit a request for a reduced payment or present a reason why it was submitted late and sometimes they make a partial payment after that there's usually three chances or so to try to recuperate some of that and they they have said they have been doing that process with everyone that they can to try to get us something thank you thank you foreign Festival there was an incident at Rivers Edge variety involving the town of Fort peripheral employees and other other and the other of the establishment the town employee had a verbal altercation with the owner of Rivers Edge variety concerning it's the many Festival activity that is establishment around 10 pm the employee threatened to disperse the people in attendance using a highly inappropriate method the incident was he was very public and witnessed by many people River's Edge as well as members of the public for this unfortunate occurrence I'd like to make a motion that the town manager be directed to write a letter of apology to the owner of Rivers Edge variety and also the public detailing the remedial actions taken by the town to ensure that such incidents do not happen in the future but the public letters should go to Fort Fairfield Caribou Presque Isle newspapers and that the draft of the letter be submitted to the Town Council for their review and approval before sending it out there's been a lot of talk about this unless you were there you saw it yeah actually I was there and I spoke to the owner of Rivers Edge last night he called me at home um and I don't think there was an altercation that was that type of basically what happened is um from what I was told from the owner and what I saw is that they were told that you know they needed to shut down there was a noise ordinance I think it was communicated to them there was a noise ordinance I don't know if there is or not honestly I'm not 100 sure but um then the town employees went across the street stood at Walgreens and just kind of observed um I think it was a little bit of an aggressive uh stance like maybe some arms cross and stuff like that but there was nothing I didn't hear any verbal altercation I didn't hear or see any I mean you were there I wasn't there yeah I was there and I talked to the owner of River's Edge last night and he said I I got a phone call on this and I feel like someone was digging for information but there really wasn't anything that I'm aware of that went on so I think that needs to be clarified he told me he told me that when well he was confirmed he was told that if the crowd didn't disperse they'd want to get wet and they were pulling a hose on and I don't know because I didn't hear the discussion so you said that they didn't especially were going to get wet I mean you don't you don't pull hoses on fire trucks and charge them and just spread I didn't see any hoses pulled out or anything like that he was told that they were going to get wet yeah that I don't know so I would think that we should discuss that with him first maybe the town manager should reach out to him he shouldn't be having this discussion openly like this period This is a personal opportunity this is not the proper procedure for presenting that information thank you part-time attorney is here he can address yeah we never uh but I don't believe we had any um concerns directly from him I mean the town azak and town manager did he come speak to you and was uh angry or upset with anything that happened yeah well what he did is he approached me having lunch one day and started talking about he was all upset about it and it was like I think I think from what I picked up on it uh there was a few misled I think it was a miscommunication yeah and I don't know and everything at that time was he was happy everybody was pretty much settled with it yeah I haven't you know all right um if not we got uh there was no second there was no second no second it's dead so I make a motion to go to the executive session under one msra 405 6A personal matters are we done with all each other uh I asked no one said anything prior to what yeah he did yeah um I have concerns about the Town Council of not being given adequate permanent account financial information we've gotten quite a bit tonight more than an hour yet um I'd like to see a telemarketers to get a printed financial report as of the last day of the previous month of the councils at least five calendars a day days prior to the monthly meeting and they include at least the following customary financial information which is all bank and other financial institutions about balances excise taxes collected and real estate taxes collected Revenue sharing revenue and expense status general ledger summary of the of the end of the month and here's the year today monthly income expenses reports for the previous months of physical year today including the budget items that were approved by the council the format would include the line item the budgeted amount the amount received or spent that month the balance and the percentage received it was spent the request formatted I'll have a repressed format I think we need to be getting that each month the only way we're going to know where we're at is since I've been on the council we haven't gotten any well it's not necessarily the council's job to manage the buzz budget it's the council's job to hire a town manager who manages the budget we approve the budget and it's her job to make sure that the budget is kept in mind and that we're only spending what's been improved so it's not our job to manage how do you know if that's the fact you know about the information Gary how do you know you can go in at any time and request information we can go in any time and request that information so if that was something that you wanted to get monthly then you could go in and request that but it's causing extra work for the staff to do those things to print those reports and get that information to us when they could be spending time looking for you know ways to lower the budget or cut spending or you know all the things that we want them to do but when we're making them do all of this extra then they're not having time to do that stuff that's just my thought on it I'm not opposed to having the information I just think that if you want the information you go in and ask and get the information anyone can get the information is that correct any citizen yes at any time public information I would think it would be the best use of everybody's time if it was the automatic done and we would need to bother to tell manager in our office well you're bother the top major making her do the reports in all this extra when it's other time time could be better spent it's not that they're what are you looking forward to be working together I think we should be working together if what he's asking for if we were to get it we would have time to look at it together we could make calls and work together and try to purchase you don't make calls we don't supposed to discuss budgets or anything amongst ourselves until we get here and I'm not opposed to getting or having the information posted needing to get it every single month like if someone wants that information I feel like at any time any of us should be able to get that if we have questions we should ask and definitely get answers to them I'm just saying to make it required that every time we come to a council meeting they need this and this and this and this it's causing additional work that could be time better spent elsewhere but that's again just an opinion so yeah I mean it'd be it'd be one thing if that information was subject to one or three by this public knowledge all five of us go in and ask a common manager for that same information everyone how much time is that going to take first I think it should be automatic I mean there's there's different I'm sorry go ahead yeah no I I think at this time uh we vote on the budget we instruct her to do what she's doing I have no reason unless somebody asked me a question to research that information directly because it is a lot of information and I can't subject that all myself um I I just don't feel at this time unless it's a specific item line item that somebody or a council member wants to know can easily you know you can you can get it the research can be done but to offer it to the table every month um i i as a I mean unless I have somebody that is circling a certain line item that that really uh has to have that information to to research it um would be the only reason I would personally unless things were way out of line that as as you know we like for instance we just had an audit and our audit is I I don't think the words perfect there's nothing perfect but close to being perfect if we had an audit done there was a bunch of things that was way off then hey we should maybe request that every month but our audit is to be almost perfect I I that's my opinion on it I guess unless just because it's public information anyway it's public information not only us as counselors anybody that's a taxpayer can walk in and get that information aren't these numbers all brought up current once a month anyways yeah yeah that's what would be the big deal and providing well they haven't it is it's it's information that's there anytime anybody wants it I guess because those uh figures are prepared every month the department hits it from every month in order for me to prepare them each month for each Council that is going to be I'm going to have to print them seven times and you're talking about uh just off the top of my head probably but you only do it one time right you only do it one time wait just a second please for me to provide them to you each month you're talking approximately 50 to 60 Pages a month that's printing that is paper you're talking the Ring of paper you're talking time to copy or print and you're talking tone and electricity now you've already cut our budget that is cutting into supplies so how do you propose that we pay for all of this extra printing if the reports are already being done and sent out can they not be sent electronically like does that solve the problem that's a good idea how is it sent to the department heads paper paper is I give them each just their their information they don't have to have all of them all the information I use one set of reports and I get each of them their information I also report the totals to the kind of the Town manager and the town counselor One Summer you have the totals of total revenue total expenses percentage year-to-date you have all of that once a month and I asked Ella starting last year and she gave comparisons from the year before thank you Ellen well at this at this time as long as information that is uh it's not only able to be uh printed it it's electronically if you attend the computer correct uh it's in the computer but I don't know through the program in case I'm not sure I mean it's already done and it can be sent electronically then it doesn't hurt anything to send it like why not but if it's causing extra then could be honest as requested basis coming forward if they can receive that electronically and want to go in and review it once a month and you'd be gone into that right yeah yeah I mean I don't think we need a motion at this point I think just instructions would work okay website as September 23. yesterday the new deadline was posted on account Facebook page as September 9th the town Charter states that the signatures we filed between 90 days and 35 days before the election the election is on November 8th you could make a deadline October control we have some verification about that it's it's my mistake um the the statute must say 60 days we have to have the signatures in 60 days before the election that's in my manual for elections foreign yes exactly I got that there's a timeline for 45 days and the 23rd would have been the 45 days I got that mixed up with the 60 days so I'm saying we're back for the night tonight thank you anything else if not um all in favor aye aye I want to thank everybody for coming tonight [Music] a completely read his point we're like your evening entertainment perfect you will just keep listening and if you have questions asked yeah yeah no I'll be home you're welcome oh I haven't put it it'll depend on what kind of mood of it and I'm sorry about 18 years,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,7GWhmLzLehQ,"Regular Town Council Meeting July 20, 2022",,38.0,2262.0,2022-07-21T11:24:48Z,none,208,0,0,0,it is six o'clock with college meeting to order uh let the record show that all council members are present i know tony is the prayer we pray for our country at all times that all citizens are safe healthy and happy we pray for wisdom for all those who guide and govern help this government body in every situation to know and to do things that are right and just with soundness of judgment in making vital decisions we pray for the

states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all thank you man next we got public comment period and before we get started i would uh just one thing i'd like to add i know the past couple three counseling meetings that we've had there's been a lot of tension and when we promote public comment period it gives everybody a chance that's here to stand and give us their response on something that might have happened or going to happen and that's why we have public comment period after public comment period uh we have discussion amongst us counselors uh it's just the way our parliamentary procedure laws prevail we can't accept any comment from anybody here that is witnessing upon our council meetings and i know tension has been high the past two or three because of different issues and and it's been you know tolerated a little although it's my job to keep the meanings on course i just want to emphasize that we we've got to stay on course and i apologize if there's anything that somebody would like to add to our discussion on new business per se and you can't until the following month if you pick out public comment period so i just would like to apologize myself uh not coordinating some of the uh meetings in our table sessions got a little out of hand because people in the crowd were adding to it but i've got to from here prepare to keep our meetings in order and if i do see anybody out of place don't be offended if i have to put you uh you know our meeting in place because of it but i just wanted to make a note of that so everybody can understand and then again i apologize if i allowed it in some ways um so at this time we will move on to public comment period anybody have anything to say or add mr chair yes uh before he started i just want to i just want to thank the blue blood festival i've had nothing but great reviews from from everybody around town the weekend before with people crowds coming through town and and i'd like to thank the police department and the fire department with the muster and stuff like that they had the kids really really enjoyed it and the smoke trailer that they enjoy and stuff like that the rec department did an excellent job and i had nothing but great reviews from everybody around town that i talked to and for the lighting i can't think of her name it was cheryl down there and i apologize sheryl but i would like to say she done a good job planning it and it was a good time by all i'd like to i'll just make that note thank you i guess i'm here tonight because i just found out that you improved budgets on june 28th i guess those little changes from what i had but i don't know what i'm restricted to say under your statements but i am being sarcastic because um i want to congratulate libby butler and collins and the manager for developing a 1.2 million dollar budget deficit it is the largest single deficit of this town in its history it was approved by boards that have been larger i guess 2013. this new budget is going to be 26 miles as i understand that's an increase of what 6.5 that's a 33 percent increase i think my math is correct so if i take taxes on my house for 3 000 i can expect to get a 4 000 bill bring you the next time around i don't know how you're going to attract people here to build anything with the tax rates going up they are in the deficits of what that we have prescott i just think they just announced a reduction in their their cost and i guess care going up but we're we lead the pack if we if we get the reputation of a high tax town you know and then brokers real estate brokers trying to move houses because you know who who wants to move emily smith told us about a month ago she was saying about putting a complex and she's in fort fairfield the system's in poor people but i think they're going to preschool so we missed out on that somehow you've got to address the spending you've got to address what you're doing your policies um i've said it before here and i'll say it again just it's mind-boggling i can't understand i was a math nature i can't understand how we continue on an average as a budget deficit of a million dollars the last four years uh in the end of july let's say it was the energy all right 19 we had a six and a half million dollar net worth that was nice when we close our books for this year with this minimum two we're going to be close to 2.6 million dollars network we wiped out two thirds of it and we still don't know we haven't heard from you people what what's happening to re-energy is it gonna be a charge against our income or i don't know somebody ought to be telling us what because we're all looking that's a half million dollars for 460 plus pieces so if you do nothing but what you've done in the last four years the next two years at a million dollars each in re-energy you have zero network you try to go to a bank and get money you're borrowing all you can right now you're short of money i know that because you're rolling nobody's gonna touch us just just consider yourself a banker you know anyway i know it's tough but somebody's got to make some tough decisions and uh if you look and and i don't want to single out the ambulance because they get all been out of shape here but i think we're going to probably have a per capita cost of maybe 470 bucks we got about 3 300 people so it's going to be around a minute and a half give or take depending how she makes the books on revenue coming from ambulance and throwing out fire but anyway what i want to show you is that preschool is paying 76 bucks caribou is 99. limestone is a hundred and caribou services limestone so there must be some way that we can look to have up an area type ambulance service that would help these small towns we wouldn't have to forego a good quality service look i said before i'm almost 81 i got some health problems i want when i call i want somebody pick me up fast but i don't know if you're really looking at the hard things and exploring and you you just got to do that we need to find an inexpensive way to do this and you got to start now so i'm suggesting that you open discussions with neighboring communities to see if there's some way some avenue that we can piggyback or do something and reduce our cost because if we paid like limestone we're pay three four hundred thousand dollars a year that's a million dollars less than what you're budgeting for so in closing i guess i'm i i do have a problem with the council i don't think i don't think there's any transparency here sometimes over the last year it's been hostile and that's not for a good working relationship but it just seems like some of us are just trying to find answers but where are our are fall on deaf doors the numbers don't come out so anyway if you guys can't support some way to stop this bleeding and cut this million-dollar loss it really should step aside and let somebody else do it it you're not going to win any flavors i'll tell you whenever you start doing that people you know they don't want to lose this they just talk about how fast they get there maybe it's changed now now the municipalities do it maybe it's changed but i haven't heard anything like that and i haven't heard anything about reality so you talk about talking back and forth because a lot of us would like to know more what's going on but there's some some policy philosophy in it hey you don't need to know just stay hell out of it i think that's what maybe i was really sorry to see that your budget advisory committee i heard was cancelled i know your town manager wasn't favored she spoke against it at the time but i would think if it's done right you could have a flow of information that we wouldn't be asking questions all the time and bugging you and maybe you take something from somebody else anyway thank you thank you mr dorsey anybody else during meetings and stuff um i think it'd you know be worth looking into having a different system how we go about the meeting whether it's per item or per uh i don't know for bullet i guess on the sheet i know public speaking at the beginning of the meeting people get frustrated because you know if you you think you know with the information going into the meeting and then you guys discuss it and vote on it and the information is if you understood differently um there's no chance for anybody to ask a question or a concern i know some other communities around the area do do differently i think it'd be worth looking into to avoid the issues um i thought last year we decided to put in public comment period and for the meeting before it's jordan did you not make this talk about i do have to see thank you thank you happens if not we'll move on to the correspondence and the reports as of july 15 2022 there is nothing to report next we got licenses and permits we have not received next we've got a financial report this is from a latent treasurer a class collected in june was fifty eight thousand four hundred and two cents with a total for the year of six hundred and fifty thousand one hundred fifty three dollars and nine cents compared to sixty five thousand nine hundred and two for six hundred and fifty thousand nine hundred and two and eighty six cents last year with a total for the year of six hundred and ninety eight thousand eighty nine dollars and thirty two cents our 2022 excise collections just decreased a total of forty seven thousand nine hundred sixty three dollars and twenty three cents compared to twenty twenty one as of six thirty twenty twenty two on collected real estate taxes for twenty twenty one for two hundred and ninety thousand eight hundred forty dollars and thirty cents compared to last year of 330 329.44 we ended the year with our revenue at 88.47 percent of budget and expense at 98.75 we received june revenue sharing in the amount of eighty one thousand eight hundred twelve dollars and fifty two cents on june 21st 2022 total revenue sharing received to date is 875 hundred eighty one dollars and forty four cents we are twelve thousand seven hundred seventy eight dollars and forty four cents over the total budgeted amount for revenue sharing next we've got the aws report mr richesky anyone tells us our last aws meeting was june 24. at that meeting we talked about uh we had an extensive amount of bleaching that we had incentive processing that we had in the month of may what was normally a year's worth um i of bring this up because i know that we need to start talking some of what possibly haven't attacked our planet that maybe the town of portugal this history could help us with that too so i'm a stickler for that people because we get we have no way knowing what peat pastures wherever chemicals is going to affect that we just going out but there's possibilities that cooking system is going to get collected they could fail and they really need some kind of that we've thought some of the landfill while putting some capital reserves aside you'll look at that and maybe work journey with john over here that's what nick is already that's just so something in the background we should be looking at our expenses for the month of may were about two and a half percent above what we had projected for year to day luckily recycling is doing very well and our overall numbers when we put all our expenses and income together we were ahead of year eight by 14 so the united states we had a new high came on board it goes around and does the recycling pickups all the aids and stuff and the young pills working out very well we've had struggles in the past with deployment issues just like the town has from the businesses we're very fortunate to hire the second fellow to do that in eastern report so it's a job we're very pleased with that the db has mentioned to us that they are going to increase their typically tenants to us by a dollar a ton so that affects very close to board everybody um we're probably going to try to work some of that in they're not told to see when they can actually underestimate they don't go by our bike again so we're going to work them into our courses for whatever they put together um did a quick update on the print uh transfer station for when they're done utilizing that i think we've got all of the bikes worked out in that and uh they were very good about making sure that whatever we're doing here we'll apply and reverse in the outcomes of this housing and during the paul's meeting in the hall's meeting we were advised that the paul is uh getting together in the afghanistan the filtration system that you're concerned about because we're plugging up uh is there an overflow collections area that that would go through you know something the dp is is they've been very good about this the speed best thing no one really knows what's going to happen with that yet there are no really good filtration systems to keep that from going to the river you're working when they clean our leaching the water goes into very routine there's no contamination that's actually setting it down now they don't really know what they want to do with that other than they're telling us to keep it in a landfill so i don't know what that's going to be wrong yet we're waiting in the dp mark has been involved with them both from the landfill perspective plus he's also on the main main board protection which is a public ep so he's kind of looking at it from both hands no one really knows what's going to happen we're just trying to speculate what we need to have in place in case that happens well where would it go right now it's so small somebody will live in the squad when we clean our leachate we're cleaning it for other chemicals that are in the region [Music] we know that this is the ability for the epp to say we'll be able to stop it somehow now that may work to our members because maybe they want us to obtain that outside which would which the question that would go to the ep just so i think it would be some kind of sudden ponder area or something that would something like that didn't happen take care of it keep it until it's treated well i know they're right over in canada they're actually making people put molecular filters on their washing machines because a lot of that comes right from when you're washing clothes with detergents no no it's from anything it's water recovery so right now or nylon clothes or peppermint bins or plastic bottles that we're drinking out of you know all of those they're all there and it's really nothing new it's been around since 1947. and and they tracked a lot of it through those systems like through the sewer treatment plants which means the way it gets there is passing through us to get there so we've all actually opened explosiveness and the dp's been very good about the way to do some research what do you mean changes on their regulations that's not been on the course there's no process to stop some restrictions hopefully yes thank you very much thank you next we'll go to old business uh budget advisory committee ordinance so you'll notice that in the amendment to the ordinance that there has nothing has been removed but there are only additions to the ordinance the most significant being two non-voting town council members shall be voted upon by the town council to serve on the budget advisory committee for a term of two years which is already precedence in some of the other boards that we have and then the word proposed for the annual town budget was added and then recommendations shall be provided to the town manager's office and presented to council in writing and the town manager shall cooperate with meet with is the addition and provide the committee with such information as maybe reasonably necessary and available to enable it to carry out its functions so the recommendation is that council introduces the budget advisory committee ordinance 22-02 amendments and direct staff to hold a public hearing on the ordinance on wednesday august 3rd 2022 that should be 6 p.m august 3rd 2022 at 6 pm the council chamber for the public so next we'll build a new business uh we got treasurer request this is from ella layton the sheriff this is for clothing allowance with public works department pass practice for the clothing allowance for all full-time public works employees in the amount of four hundred dollars each has become part of their payroll with a gross adjustment this requires the employee to pay taxes and fico on this amount this also requires the town to pay python with council's approval her suggestion is that we change this practice to issuing each employee account check in the amount of 400 each checks would be for clothing allowance and will be issued once a year the first pay period in july by issuing an account check the employee would benefit and we would take public works and the town approximately three hundred and seven dollars per year she's asking the council to please approve this above suggestion effective 71-2022 so would the employees be required to bring receipts we're giving them the money to purchase the clothing for her we don't require them now to bring it's part of the benefit of working for the public works department they get closing allowances they um so past practice here for the last 25-30 years has been you do not require i put to the treasurer to find ways to save us money and that's okay we have a potion do we have a second sorry put a motion in a second we'll uh go for a vote melissa jim kevin and i will die next we got the minutes of june 28 2022 special town council meeting usually if you have any questions before you close the quote there's a few of that powerful term is performed so just so you know she can only um do the minutes based on what she hears from the video so if it sounds like you're saying perform er that may be why it says that what is the spelling that you are looking for to change yeah just performance so going forward evaluation of whatever is proposed be so under the circumstances of noted phone will stay the same under the circumstances that was stated so we thought that i like mixed that unlike jim next we got warrants number 26 and warrant number for o1 26 and the amount of one million seven thousand nine hundred ninety dollars and one cent was completed on six thirty twenty twenty two warrant number one in the amount of two hundred eighty one thousand sixty nine dollars and forty one was completed on 7 11 20 22. next we'll move out there so i have some numbers for us so through uh from january 1 to the end of june comstar our new ambulance building company submitted 353 bills printed three billable runs out of those 353 billable runs 304 of them were to medicaid or medicare the total amount submitted was two hundred and thirty seven thousand six hundred ninety one dollars and sixty seconds with 304 of them being medicaid medicare there's an allowable amount that they're just not gonna pay because the federal government decide what they're gonna pay so that total that we're not going to receive from those for sure is forty seven thousand ninety six dollars and forty five cents which leaves an outstanding amount of 190 595 dollars and 15 cents so so far this month in july we've received sixty five thousand four hundred and forty seven dollars and nineteen cents of that that's been done uh they are up to date on july's billing and they will submit us monthly reports uh in addition i want to reiterate as i have passed several meetings that some of our runs from the beginning of this year we're probably not going to receive payment on or we're going to receive a reduced amount because the lack of timely billing caused by main building services what comstar has agreed to do is continue to to negotiate with the insurance companies to try to get what we can back if they're not able to get something they're going to compile me a list to run and the total amount not collected so that hopefully within a few months i'll have i'll know exactly what we're not receiving because of main billing services inability to hold up there into the contract and i can bring that back to you guys so you'll have that total go after them or that would be something that you as a council would have to consult the town's attorney vote that is that is why i'm getting you that information so you'll have a dollar value of what we're what we're missing out on because of their inability to do what we contracted with them to do as a year-to-date total uh as of today we've done 405 ems calls and 111 fire calls what we call them that's basically any call that's not a ambulance transporting patient or an annual design nomination uh so is there any other questions about billing or well i just did one cody what was the reason they weren't paying so with insurances you need to submit bills within a certain time frame each insurance company has different time frame generally it's three months maybe billy didn't do that calm start we just recently signed a contract with they have now gone back and done from january 1st so we're waiting too long basically they said did not submit bills in a timely fashion and how much do we pay billing for their service if they collect the money we pay 5.5 of what's collected to once you have a total dollar value i think it would be easier for you to take that into your town's attorney to discuss that option i know that other towns are doing the same thing with maine building because what do you say what we're waiting on is 190 595.15 not all of that is not billable uh it would most likely be uh january february and part march probably anyway again they're they have submitted everything to all the insurance companies and we've only received one denial letter so far and they're they're doing their full process so they're going to appeal the denial and just like they would if it was something that wrong we did yesterday so they're going to they're going to do the whole process and fight what they can they're just being upfront like like i told you guys that it's some of them were just not going to be able to build because it's outside that time when no one and especially with mainecare medicare they're again once again they're the government so they say it goes and they don't have to pay so but with some of the other insurance companies that sometimes they're able to negotiate a lower amount of what we build but again they don't know until they go through their whole process which they will be doing and they will get us a spreadsheet of what the run is how much we build what we did collect we were able to collect anything and then what the difference is so i can bring that back to you guys thank you thank you anything else i don't think uh next uh executive session mr essay 405 68. i want to thank everybody thank you,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,8CZdDNg47Fs,"Special Town Council Meeting June 28, 2022",,124.0,7460.0,2022-06-29T11:29:47Z,none,437,1,0,0,we pray for our country at all times that all citizens are safe healthy and happy we pray for wisdom for all those who guide and govern help this government body in every situation to know and to do the things that are right and just the soundness of judgment making vital decisions we pray for the peacemakers that the holy life-giving spirit ever dwell in their hearts and the barriers of fear suspicion and hatred may fall this we pray the holy father amen i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation and god indivisible with the referendum next we'll have public comment period uh if anybody has anything to state uh come to the podium state your name anybody i was waiting you've known me for a while i got two things i'd like to address with you tonight one has to do with how you conduct yourselves and your meetings the other has to do with the ordinance that allegedly appears to be the subject of this special meeting looking at what was made available to us as the agenda for tonight's meeting it would appear that this special meeting has been called for the purpose of having having a public hearing on ordinance 2205. it doesn't make any sense because that was already held so you gotta wonder if the meeting has been called for the council to act on this ill-conceived ordinance well that ordinance is not an emergency by any stretch of the imagination it does not rise to the level of importance to call this special counsel meeting so why are we really here um it appears to me that for fairfield town council and town manager are conducting the business of this town in a manner that's deliberately organized to stifle input from taxpayers and citizens of the community your you your agendas do a poor job of detailing what's to be considered at your meetings you may public comments available only at the very beginning of the meeting and if the public does not really know what will be discussed at the meeting it's extremely difficult for them to offer pertinent comments one has to wonder how your behavior stacks up against the freedom of access act i for one would like to see the council become more upfront and more transparent as to matters that will come before you at your meetings this could be as simple as requiring that any item that will come before you for a formal vote be properly identified on your agendas if someone like the town manager wants to spring something on you at the last minute without due notice and inadequate time for proper review and consideration on your parts it should be for discussion purposes only if something is legitimately an emergency requiring a special meeting with council action simply needs to be listed on the agenda so people including you as counselors can come to your meetings properly prepared ordinance 2205 i would urge you to either outright reject this ordinance or send it back to whomever was the author in order to fix all the flaws in the document be perfectly clear i am not opposed to revenue enhancements as we try to deal with the financial mess the town is in any legitimate revenue must be considered along with necessary expense contaminants if we are to avoid the fight if we need to avoid the financial ruin of this community this ordinance serves the opposite purpose the other thing you should understand about me is notwithstanding my comments about fire and ems budgets i'm not an enemy of fire and ems services i'm the son of a man that was fire chief of van buren for almost 40 years this is a man who was amongst the first to introduce cutting edge concepts and technologies that at the end of the day improve the fire department and reduce costs to property owners in that community so support of these services is in my genes so to speak my father was also very frugal with how he spent the time of nbar's tax dollars the reasons for my recommendation include the ordinance is out of compliance with several provisions of the town charter the ordinance has the real potential to increase property insurance costs for the property owners of our community and therefore suck even more money out of this town's payers taxpayers than fire and ems is currently extracting out of this community the ordinance does not reduce the amount of spending on the part of the taxpayers of the town for fire and ems services if you seriously want to consider this concept a true and accurate pro forma should be prepared and presented to the council for your consideration i've got tons of supporting data on all of these points since debate is not an option afforded to us as citizens either at the public hearing nor a council meetings i'll gladly offer my details as whatever form may exist in conclusion we should not lose track of the fact that the taxpayers and citizens of this community are you as counselors are supposed to be working for their voices were heard loud and clear at the last town council meeting that they expect you to get your spending in line with something significantly more reasonable than what has been what has been presented so far the budget vote was a really good first start and likely all that could be accomplished at that point in time but we've got much more work to do thank you kevin thank you speaking tonight in regards to how the town meeting information is posted to the public um i know it's posted here and there are two banks we have in town but it seems in this day and age a little bit irrelevant to be posting it in places where nobody has in today's day and age going into each place weekly anymore i know a lot of you guys most people do online banking now and it's not some people might set foot in a bank once a year um in town office maybe once or twice a year um so i don't know if there's one we can change it can be changed to post it get businesses in town people going regularly whether it be iron js the iga you know stores the post office that people go into regulations they can see it and i think it'd be beneficial possibly i know the town has a social media page on facebook at least one posting there before the meeting let people know that it's out there i did read some comments on our facebook page that people don't know when the information is till after you guys have them and it's kind of pointless to have it done after the fact so if there's any change that can be done it would be i think beneficial for the citizens of town to know that the other item i have is i have the agenda for tonight's meeting here that's provided here um i went down to the bank and looked at the one at the bank and they're a little bit different um on old business um i wanted to bank guitar and trust under there's only one item under old business and it's that's posted here but under other there's nothing um so i kind of feel they should kind of be the same when they go out public unless there's a reason for change i know it says on if this was edited because there's a council conflict someone couldn't be here whatever but it kind of should say the same thing before you guys are going to the meeting because this one has five bullets under other and the one at the town that the katahdin trust doesn't happen and i have a picture of this thing i want look at it that's all i have thank you thank you shane anybody else if not we'll move on to old business we got ordinance 22-05 public ordinance hearing a public hearing was held for the fire and rescue services cost recovery ordinance on june 2022 at 6pm in the council chambers at the fort pierce municipal building there was no one that spoke for there was no one that spoke against and no one that spoke either for or against each other fire and rescue services cost recovery ordinance 22-05 the recommendation is that the town council approves the fire and rescue services cost recovery ordinance 22-05 i hope that will reject re-reject this ordinance in a second we'll have discussion what grounds uh i think it could be reintroduced and we'd be given more time to study it um i've researched three towns that have it the ornaments it's quite different but they took a long time to set it up i wasn't able to get all the information because a couple of the fire chiefs are on medical leave but i will get in next thing so what would left flaws in it be like the way that it's written what does this mean i've just said what are what would the flaws in it mean like the way that it's currently written well there's a lot to it like mr burchard alluded to oh knowing what it will do with iso rating is very important that's what each fire department is rated on that's fire insurance it's traded on so it is important to get it right right i'm just not sure how it'll affect our iso rating when it's geared towards billing that's what my question is on that because am i almost 10 years in insurance i don't know how fire department billing affects it's your distance from the fire department that affects your insurance rating not necessarily how the fire department does the building so that's why i'm just asking i want to make sure that i'm understanding where the every annual service or fire service that i contacted was different how they built they are yes some only have fire not fire an ambulance and i think it's an important thing to have but i think it needs to be researched a lot more than just a performance needs to be made for us to have any idea how much absolutely good evening thank you uh this ordinance would have zero effect on iso i actually just spoke to iso earlier in the week today to do our update for our iso rating that we should hopefully have soon and hopefully it will improve this also will cost the town and the taxpayers nothing because it is designed to build in those that have insurance to be fair and equal everyone who has a structure fire will receive a bill but as you can see in the ordinance it is up to you all to decide if you choose to bill citizens or not if you specifically write you will only bill insurance companies no insurance company will pay it i know this because i have researched the over 250 communities that do this billing through central maine cost recovery which is the largest fire building agency in new england this uh ordinance is based on those 250 or city ordinances town ordinances put together the one that works the best to get the most back from insurance companies that wording that works best so yes they're every town has different wording in their ordinance some are very short some are longer this ordinance is compiled to fit our town and to make sure that we're able to recover the most from insurance companies currently we recover zero from fire calls zero so any amount of money we are able to recover would be money that we don't currently recover so again to clarify this would cost the taxpayers zero this would have no effect positive or negatively on the iso rating and this has been thoroughly researched by the leading company that does fire department cost recovery in new england not just maine but all of new england and this is an ordinance that i worked on with them using the templates from those other towns so it has been thoroughly researched um if there's any other questions and that's right i do clarify this is for five years this is this has nothing to do with ems billing this is solely for a fire department response not to do with an ambulance or if you if an ambulance comes and transports somebody this is just the fire related expenses when i say fire related so this could be a hazmat spill where there's no fire but we respond and do clean up or anytime the fire department goes and somebody is not transported by an ambulance so did you do a performer on this no this is this is an area where again any amount of money that we were able to recuperate from insurance companies is if we're able to recuperate one dollar that's one dollar we did not have where will the dollar go to our equipment our vehicle replacement which hasn't been funded in the last two years does prescott caribou do this caribou does and presque isle i'm not sure if they've officially done it but it is something that is in the works for them as well absolutely okay and then if i remember correctly from the last time you presented this without this ordinance we cannot correct without an ordinance you cannot bill for fire cost recovery because there's nothing in statute that says you can build the only way you can bill is by creating a town ordinance that's why every town has to adopt an ordinance if they want to bill for fire department cost recovery and it also would apply to like car crashes we can build the auto insurance for the clean up and the response it also um allows the council to revisit the pricing and and this price scale in case prices should go up or down it allows for that as well so it's the reason this ordinance is so long is because it has there's been so much research and effort put into it to make sure a is effective at getting insurance companies to pay because that's that's the target audience is the insurance company it's not the person that just lost their house but to be fair just like with medical billing everyone has to get a bill and the bill has to be based on the same set standard pricing so it will come to you guys if the person doesn't have insurance and you or whoever is in your spot will make a determination on whether anybody has to pay so okay so on the memorandum section one cost recovery billing authorized this is any person in or business who shall receive emergency medical or fire department services requested by any such person or on behalf of such person by any other person acting in good faith and in the interest of health or safety of such services recipients shall pay for the town affordability fee for services provided then section two definitions of services you've got billable costs associated to personnel and apparatus response to fire permit violations response to a hazardous material incident response to a vehicle crash or vehicle fires response to an aircraft crash response to fault fire or sprinkler alarms response to water related emergencies stand standby for utility lines in the roadway uh seeing and safety control at traffic accidents any any other incident as determined by the fire chief so these are all these are all things that you can build for yes it basically any time the fire department goes to a call that isn't an ambulance call so either the insurance company is going to be paying or the individuals might be paying current way i understand that right or you are you as the council are able to waive the fee but yes the intent and how every community that has accepted this ordinance is the intent is to collect from the insurance company many insurance companies have it built into a plan that if they receive a bill they pay a certain fraction 75 100 whatever it may be we can't ever seek that unless you have an ordinance that allows you to build thank you anyone else if not um i want to thank you we'll go for bo melissa can you repeat the uh the motion please that we're voting on i hi kevin hi no next we've got uh other mr chairs we have to make a motion to approve the ordinance okay all right so we have a motion to approve the ordinance i'll make a motion to approve the ordinance we've got a motion in a second so as far as concerning insurance the concern that was brought up i can tell you that this billing does not affect the iso rating as far as insurance is concerned so if that's the concern then that's my comfort level on it so are there other concerns or because i don't have any with it i just i want to know if there's other my only my concern is we're talking a bunch of stuff like that and and revenues and other towns are going thank you but they're you know when you get responsible some of these fire for that kevin is so welcoming red ridden red for us you know this is just to recover some of the stuff in the fire department sending the fire truck out and something that's you know that probably could have been a preventable or you know that with what they show us in the air crash and stuff like that i mean it's just to recoup some type they send that truck out what gives us the right to be able to build the insurance company and as a council if an insurance company does not approve a claim and the citizen is billed we have the right to waive that bill before the council yes so we're not billing the citizens extra we're allowing them the ability to build the insurance companies which right now they don't have so we can't collect on services from insurance companies right i think i think as this ordinance is is put into place um as it's being used we may find that there's some adjustments that we can make but at least right now they could start you know acting on this as soon as they could and it's it's you know if there is some good information that comes about we we can always add it to it i don't know if the public is aware of what the ordinance ordinance is obviously they didn't come to the hearing um didn't help apparently oh i don't i think they need to know more about this before we push this through i think it's our job as the council to explain it to them when they have questions though so if we understand it and we feel comfortable it's our job to make the decisions well i certainly don't understand it and i researched it quite a bit and talking to fire chiefs three of them that i talked to they want me to come sit down with them tell me how it works each community is different but their building is different because they provide services for other communities as well did you sit with our fire chief no i did not did you reach out to our car chief the one that asked for the ordinance i just got his information on paper okay because that would probably be my first stop would be my recommendation i just got this back at six o'clock last night so i don't know anything about it that's why i i'm not in favor of something i know nothing about so i i just some table if we could take what do we know more about it so it was presented at previous council meeting and discussed at previous council meetings and this is just the information from the public coordinates this is just reiteration of what was already discussed at council meetings then there was a public hearing and there was a public hearing so this isn't brand new information that you just received this system i got this last night i just you know i just feel it's good business uh like i said i i know that if there's some information that comes forth that would benefit our community and department heads with this we can adjust accordingly but i think as soon as uh as possible we can start uh billing insurance companies uh you know the benefit it is to our community so i would just rather bill insurance companies than the citizens like i don't want to see but that's where people are going to have to be informed the fact that if they do have a claim that's denied that they can come to the town and they can ask for forgiveness for their portion you know so and it's that's done well if uh so we'll go for a vote melissa i met him him kevin and i will die next we'll uh go to other a we got the minutes on the town council meeting 6 15 22. make a motion we approve the minutes 5 seconds and a motion in a second we'll have a vote for clarification can you make sure that we list the town council meeting and the importance as listed before asking for most sex minutes to be here it's more than one yeah the the ord 2205 public hearing on 6 20 22 for the record uh we'll add that to that motion to make a motion we approve the minutes from the town council meeting and from the um ordinance public hearing we have a motion in a second we'll go for vote melissa i mitch jim hi kevin and i will die next we got clarification fy 2223 budget motion and vote the background council voted on the motion i make a motion that we meet somewhere in the middle of those two places between this unfunded cips and the flat election discussion there was no actual budget amount voted on by council to operate starting fiscal year 2223 on july 1st 2022 the town manager's office will need to know the budget amount recommendation is town council makes a motion with clarification on fiscal year 2223 budget the motion and vote for fiscal year 2223 that was made and passed on 6 15 2022 was an arbitrary monetary so as it stands at this time we're looking at a number that was ranging in that 5 million 258.95 we've all gone with budget that would give us a deficit of 854 thousand eight hundred and seventy dollars with what i received last night out of debt it looks like it's coming up with a deficit million six thousand six hundred fifteen that's the difference of a hundred fifty one thousand seven hundred and forty five dollars of extra spending i moved to the council direct manager to redo the budget expense sheet to match what was voted on the last budget which would leave us a deficit of 854 870 so the council were to do that because we received our second funding so we can't use that in the revenues you'll notice your revenue is different as well but we can't use that amount for the next fiscal year so we have to remove that from the revenue side because we are receiving it in this fit spoken the earth but the european amount 170 173 6775 that was in the last consolidation i wasn't in this one so you removed it we had to because we are receiving it in this fiscal year we will not be receiving that in the next so in that amount that was averaged in what her directions were the figures were right at that 5 million 258.95 so when i made the motion i wanted to get us to a 24 mil rate and i know that the mill is not firm but we look we were looking for a figure that would get us to that and then when we talked about it we were at 800 and i don't remember the exact amount off the top of my head but deficit 800 000 and something approximately approximately yes but you have to add the 173 in them because and that's me i don't like to make it pretend to know it because i really don't believe that would be until up to the first however if you're just doing numbers based on what we already have that's about 20 as opposed to because it's breakdown 1853 it was 173 that came in but again i don't have the specific number it's very difficult to ask me to do a budget um with an arbitrary building that does not exist so you're you're literally asking me to start july 1st with a number that doesn't exist and i'm not comfortable with that because it is my responsibility once the council votes on a number to follow through with that number for that entire fiscal year um by charter i have to do that so without a number i cannot it's the same as the last two years and we know that not a number that we could really use for that number i assume that we could get a figure for the whole year from june 1st of last year before we were talking about um reimbursement the income side um dc actually just spoke with our new provider for the billing and he can inform you hey again as we spoke about several meetings ago i don't remember exactly which one it was but we've switched from main billing services to comstar ambulance billing main ambulance billing was not holding up their bargain their end of the deal they hadn't built anything in 2022 so comstar took over a week and a half ago so within 12 hours they had built every run from january 1st through june 1st there's currently three days this week that they haven't already built for we haven't received any money in yet because it's only been a week and a half since the bills have been submitted in contrast maine billing services did billing once a month at the end of the month so they were essentially two months behind when they set up the bill so comstar is three days behind so we will be receiving our funds in a much more timely fashion and we won't have to fight as much with insurance companies sometimes if it's extended beyond whatever the insurance company has for a set period of time you have to do an appeal process we won't have that problem because they're being submitted it looks like twice a week they go in and build all the runs that are in there ready to build so so do you have a number come in i don't have an accurate number because we haven't received anything for 2022 yet because maine ambulance did not make billing services dependent on the number that was with you last year but i remember seeing the number that came in that for you i believe the number is the same number from last year but they didn't yeah i have yet to receive 365 days worth of billing so i can't update that number until i do hopefully that will be soon because as i've said now everything up to three days ago has now been submitted and built so that that income should be one uh i understand what you're saying but i i'm unable to give you a more updated number until i actually get 365 days worth of bills paid do you have a total amount that was billed i have not got that i have requested but i did not get that back from you okay and if we didn't receive anything for 365 days do we like i'm sure there must be some follow-up that was done we have received payments i haven't received a full year's worth of payments so we were receiving some we just hadn't received the year well we are still receiving payments today we got two payments for ambulance bills that were prior to 2022. we just none of them until last week none of the bills in 2022 had been submitted to insurance companies because our billing company was not doing what they needed so from january to june uh 15 i believe there was no billing that was done we handed it over to the new billing company a week and a half ago and they built all of them from january 1st so why was there no billing then i i have reached out to the company uh numerous times the owner the now owner that took over in november uh hasn't been in the office uh did we pay for the service we do not pay uh we pay a percentage of what they receive in income so we haven't paid bills because she hasn't been in to send us a bill but we are receiving the payments for the things she has submitted for bills and just so you know we're not the only ambulance service that has this problem i know of at least three other in a rooster county that have switched because of the same issue and there are two other ones that i've spoken with that are in the process of switching now something like that you don't know when you're going to make some money correctly they're waiting that long to build and then it goes to the insurance company and you're going to wait for them so it's it could be months for me correct comstar everything's submitted now up to like i said three days ago and then uh there it looks like tuesdays and thursday or mondays and thursdays are the days they're billing so thursday they should be billing those six plus whatever we have today for runs so they have a different they uh so everything's automated with comstar maine billing did everything the old way paper bills calling on the phone faxing commstar's all-electronic so i went through the process with them of switching us them to our billing agent automating our system so now they get all of our runs they get into our ems system get our runs they submit it electronically to all the insurance companies and the insurance companies can then send us electronic funds transfer so the cut down the turnaround time on the actual bill is significantly reduce whereas before uh main building got into our billing com they printed our bills they went through it they coded it they sent a paper bill to the insurance company the insurance company would then approve it or diet based on how long they took them to bill it send an appeal then they would send a check to them in the mail again so it's significantly decreased the amount of the turnaround time for payment but again i don't know for sure how long that will be i know it will be significantly less they've only been a week and a half since they've been approved to actually bill so every every chief i've talked to including large departments at bangor scarborough uh davier just switched so everyone i've talked to has had great success and it's a lower percentage that we're being charged on our recovered amount i believe main billing was five and a half or six and comstar is five it's it's cheaper and it's more efficient so we really haven't seen a lot of revenue coming in because of the other company correct correct so that's a problem has been addressed and hopefully the next time we meet i'll be able to speak with you and give you a better update better pictures thank you so the deficit amount that we had voted on was 854 870 dollars so but that does not cover that was discussion but the actual motion that was made and that's that's what i'm having a hard time with the actual motion that was made was i make a motion that we need somewhere in the middle of those two places between this unfunded cips and the flat budget that we meet somewhere in the middle is an actual monetary amount they need to have a number otherwise my fiscal year budget is is an arbitrary amount and i am not comfortable with deciding what that number is yeah the only number that i came up with was uh minimal standards of meeting department heads and it's just my number was 5 million 258.95 anything less than that we don't need contract is there was a number five million 258.95 and what does that give us for a total for the deficit [Music] i think around i i that's a hard one to put but i'm going to say somewhere's around i didn't bring that i just worked on the total number off and what our payroll contracts run that we approved to meet standards in them and cutting everything that brought me down to that number and i could be missing some but it wouldn't be much on that yeah i mean i guess i didn't say it correctly but like going back in the minutes it's i mean deficit amount of 850 4 800 and 70 000 with an estimated mill rate of 24. estimated obviously was what my understanding was that we voted on that's what my understanding was yeah and if you circle that that's going to be well it was my understanding also that would be enough to take your account what was that what was asked is that isn't enough for our staff if you go back and read the minutes the question that was asked of me from counseling isn't enough to provide for our staff not to provide services for the town so i answered that question yes it covers us being able to pay our staff at the rates that they're supposed to be paid would would make it work still affect services services services will be affected by that amount yes services i don't know what those will be but we don't know that yet this that's that's the minimal bottom number that's it anything less than that i mean even at that number we're probably going to have a hiccup or two and and know that something could come about you know that's not funding any of the reserves that's not that's just turning a budget i mean it's very far from my deal but it's scary just a stupid dumb questions questions consolidate expenses 22 23 days june 13th the sheep that has zero reserves has total expenditures of 7.9 million dollars you're proposing five no no i realize that what will happen is our we're gonna lose some services there's gonna be some stuff that's gonna it will be able to pay staff but there's gonna be i mean there's only so much to go around so i don't know at that amount there will be cuts too you know where you're getting your numbers the expenses or cuts i'm sorry to what the departments have you slash and burn to get to so we have municipal expenses and municipal revenue the amount of money that is on here on your consolidated expenses that comes from the school is not part of our municipal expense and our municipal revenue it is why each tax bill has a breakdown of what your municipal expense your school expense and your county expenses on your individual tax bills it shows you what your tax dollars are going towards so what we're discussing is i need to know what the municipal expense amount is from council for me to be able to move forward with the budget as of july 1st 2023 22-23 there's nothing else you can do about the school or the county 5 million 258.95 just five two five eight zero nine five five two five eight nine five zero seven five so that is the zero caller that is the million-dollar deficit and that's a 25 meal so we all understand what that is yeah it's it's in that equation but i'm not basing it really at the mill rate other than what i picked up on from last year but don't i mean that's my figures and i'm just trying to go into each department and draw a line and even at that amount it's it's it could suffer some department heads but i'm just looking at you know both sides of the field in the original budget that was presented to council in march at the first department head budget here we have since cut one million four hundred and seventy four thousand twenty six dollars from municipality budget to accommodate council's requests each time we meet um and we are very below bare minimum so services will have to be cut and it's just a fact you can only provide services for the amount of money that you have to do that with so we can't you know pretend that we can buy tires for the public works department you know later this year if we need them if the money is not there but what i will tell you is that i am not going to choose a number for you tonight counselors you have to give me that number i can tell you what i want but you are not going to like it because i already presented it to you because you said no the specific number that you're looking for is the municipal expense number the principal expense i have to have that or i cannot run a budget for fiscal year 22-22 [Music] all right using the number from last time and i just need someone to please verify that i'm correct the municipal expense would be four million eight hundred and sixty eight thousand seven hundred sixty four dollars you've just eliminated the only number i this is my portion uh that came up with that won't eliminate not saying that all departments will be running at 100 it won't would be 5 million 258.95 wouldn't that's a slash that's just that's gonna make everybody get up and go to work in the morning you know and what would the deficit be without the gearbox what would that be would you have a quick number on that angrier one million two hundred forty four thousand two hundred and one dollars one million one two hundred forty four thousand but again it depends on what the state gives us for evaluation our homestead are ready for veterans uh it depends on what percentage they value that act what we get for them and what we get from municipal revolutionary so that final number works out so all of those final numbers come in september that seems to be the big issue that we keep running into is that everything comes in september and we have to decide now yes is there a way to rectify that yes but supplemental passions i hope that we tabled the budget vote and filled the countdown but then we just have to have another meeting and sit here and do the same thing so we might now we gotta have it before so just like last year orange charter you one we have to run off of the last but you have to you can't just continuously run off of the previous years you'll have to meet again you have to discuss it until you come to a vote it's not it's not a reason to just stay with a flat budget because really a flat budget doesn't exist for us because we have collective gardening bargaining agreements and inflation you're lying to your citizens if you tell them that you can run things for the same amount that you had last year in the budget if you ask for that again this year because you have been repeatedly told and shown that that is not possible to do in order to provide the services for instance the level of care that they've been asking for and what they have always had and that's how i come up with that number basically took last year's added the inflation we have plus the contracts that we've signed and i know it's not right to the kenny but it's not far off i don't know what else to do if i don't know how far off that would be but it's it's it's in line i mean i'm sure there's some there's some tweaks but i'm sure we're not proud i think that number would would work on what we have to do no necessities that i originally said is the difference of 151 000. without that amount we can't find wow we went through everybody's budgets the very next day and we have to cut services significantly but this is my biggest concern is that we have this much labor and i've got to watch it do this much work for a year and you are the folks that are going to suffer from us doing this much work we're talking about half the powers we really are because the the cost of fuel has gone up so much those trucks will not run without fuel uh when the last budget came down the discussion i understand it was kind of vague but we went back and looked at it and said this is what's going to happen we had to we had to cut fuel back by 25 000 in a year where fuel prices have over doubled that i don't think you can say any more the men want to get out and do something they thank you yes please yes so last year um the police department budget was significantly slashed due to zero staffing if we flatline a budget i believe the budget that was passed last year was 456 000 if we flatline our budget to that it'll essentially have to lay off a police officer we will not have the adequate police coverage so far this year our officers have dealt with 1107 calls for service including very serious crimes sexual assaults rapes domestic violence very dangerous incidents with firearms our budget covers one officer working 20 hours a day plus on-call time there's there are no elaborate items in our budget we we met after the last council meeting and i was told to cut close to 33 000 from the budget out of a 580 thousand dollar budget that's significant it takes away over time that we need to send a police officer to the police academy for four months takes away equipment fuel i'm concerned that we won't adequately be able to function off of that any questions thank you thank you for the library i wouldn't even be able to keep the heat on at six thousand dollars was what was in my heat budget for last year i can't even keep the heat running i hit eight thousand dollars this year i had to take my other line items i upped it for this budget if you go back to that six thousand you're gonna have busted pipes you're gonna have water damage you're gonna lose your building thank you after our last meeting we went back and i had to cut 168 000 more than we already cut so that meant nine line items were zero zero dollars plus five other align items were substantially cut i've talked to you all numerous times about maintenance and vehicles and funding reserves and we've talked about how we need to use our maintenance budget to repair our vehicles so maintenance was one that i kept a little money in it should be enough for about three weeks before we run out of money for vehicle maintenance so if we cut more i just don't know where you want me to cut it from and still be able to provide a service uh after last budget uh council asked us to pay thirty six thousand dollars from our department budget uh that thirty six thousand dollars took away from our um ability to fix the steps that are broken out front and currently right now dangerous took away uh some plans for renovating inside for storage spaces which we can no longer use um because they are not fire rated um as well as we had to get rid of some staffing and some programs so already some programs have been cut so i mean it's definitely one of those things where i i don't envy your decision but just know that already the decision that you made is cut programming thank you so if we lost we get a motion you know at this point we we that's that's nothing the best i can do somebody wants to get emotional can ask a question on the monies that are supposed to be filled out for the fire department for the emts we can't even know what a budget number is now it's like 300 000 400 000 there's some money that could be used for part of this budget if it's coming in i mean there's your buffer if that's what it needs to be it's already included what's the number then you couldn't tell us what it was yeah before 408 142 was last year's amount what happened and it's going into this year's budget the same amount is going into this year's budget where is that that money is calculated into next year too you get 800 000 going in there so last year was 408 for 642 in this year's 408 642 and that could be more than that but we know that it'll be at least that amount because we had that that we collected first we don't have a rolling budget we have a fiscal year budget so began to budget at 6 30 2022 that's it that's the end of our budget the new budget is supposed to start july 1st of 2022 so any revenues or expenses as of that point does not exist moving forward through the fiscal year 2022 2023 unless council has voted to move anything forward um so we did receive extra revenue in other areas that have put us to a point where we close out the books we will be eventually ahead but you can't carry over what you had from fiscal year 22 20 21 22 into automatically 22-23 so does that money just dissolve what do you do with the money what happens is it the deficit again there is no deficit there is no balanced budget until the budget is the fiscal year ends on 6 30 20 whatever you work online because because a municipal budget is not the same as a business or a bank or any of them we have to run off of a fiscal year and when that fiscal year closes that's whether we were either in a deficit or we were right at or we were an overlay so right now you have a very healthy overlay possibility for next year given its 1.4 million dollars from the municipal side of things the only thing that you know that is constant is the school and the county that's it whatever happens throughout the fiscal year next year could change infinitely as we saw during the pandemic things can change from day to day what our expenses and revenues are that come in and go out so there is no such thing as um overspending any of that step that's why i need a number so that i don't overspend anything otherwise i could be overspending if you have an amount in your head that you think you're supposed to be at and you don't tell me what that is and you're asking me to guess to get to that point then we have to have some other serious conversations i need an actual monetary amount so that i make sure that we do not go over that amount 5258.95 how much how much six percent 58.99 won't work five million won't put us we're close we're you're close but five million won't meet the contract payroll contracts that we have said having a hard time understanding how just throwing a number out there when you've been presented with budget numbers of what it cost to provide these services and then coming up with an arbitrary number it's very difficult for me to understand why i understand that council does not want to raise the mill rate to raise taxes but we have to remember that if you are experiencing inflation at home we are definitely experiencing inflation here with the town because we are not responsible for just one household we are responsible for all households and we have to provide those services for all of them the businesses the citizens the visitors everyone that comes to port curriculum who lives in fort fairfield who works in fourth grade and in order to do that we have given you what those numbers look like now council did not like any one of the three budgets that were presented that were asked to be presented so we did and you you came up with a motion that is again an arbitrary monetary amount and i'm asking you again to come up with an amount that actually befits and befalls the budgets that were presented to you so making the statement that i'm more comfortable with five million dollars because of what you think the mill rate will be i don't understand how you can do that without understanding what my staff has just told me was going to happen so please be careful whatever your number is this is my my last 2 30. please be careful whatever that number is that you vote on tonight that you want me to follow and have my staff follow he's very thoughtful and you understand what that's doing but what that amount is and what that will do for next year's collected collected data from the budget advisory committee numbers that they had come up with and then followed on where we were on payroll contracts and then looked at basically last year's budget and then just met of handing her a budget and and it's going to work but there's there's no ice cream no we'll worry about it year goes on one of the departments need money we'll have to find it but if somebody throws a motion for five two five eight nine five we'll all sleep tonight and like i said that number i acquired not right by myself it was a good part from the budget advisor committee numbers that i pulled from them mostly and then from what i review i promise if we get by if we get a motion for 5 million 258.95 everybody will sleep well tonight we're not we're not gonna sleep with satin sheep but we're asleep and we'll be able to move our community in town forward we have no say on the county budget well once i vote this in that amount plus what their amount is is automatic i mean it's added this can consolidate expense form that we have in front of us with the amount and i couldn't have got that number without the committee can you clarify yeah that's just the amount that you okay here's what i gave to my staff the next day after and that's how we came up with making those cuts and all of the services that are are cut now based on on that amount um there will be loss of staff and lots of services on the map department so that's where the extra that bob is saying would come in my figures are yeah it's been a tough battle but i can assure you that it would work if we got a if we got a motion for that amount can you verify that information for us andrea so we had to cut 437 586 from uh five two five eight nine five so we won't have to cut staff probably still have some lots of services because we took the percentage of what was cut versus the budget amount for each department so instead of just you know six divided by six you can't do that because you do you automatically eliminate departments by doing that because we have some departments that have less than 150 000 for their fiscal year budget and we have some that are over a million so it was based on the percentage of their of budgets um so for some of these departments it will put money back into it do the copy of the three options that you presented to us no because council has said they didn't want them the first one that was asked for was totally funded with cip's capital improvement plan reserves the second one was partially funded capital improvement plan reserves and the third one that was asked out was the first one nobody [Music] okay [Music] involving year five two week five nine five the school budget and and the county taxes are including that figure it's not included in that that's the municipal number and then the full budget includes the school's amount and then the accounting taxes the school's amount is two million two hundred three thousand four hundred and thirty two dollars and the county taxes seven thousand two hundred bob is proposing 525-895 [Music] that is 525 895 there's a number missing yeah i know there's a cereal that's 5 million five 258.95 it's got to be nine hundred and fifty dollars right nine hundred and fifty dollars thank you right yeah that's what's throwing me off yeah nine hundred and fifty dollars thank you but that's beating the numbers on using all the input from the from the budget advisory committee it's using all the numbers on the deductions that the department has done the past three meetings and that's it i'm not quite sure about the budget advisory no no uh i should i should word that differently i i picked up an idea that there was numbers and i apologize i didn't bring my skin booklet that i just showed you but i picked up a number from what you guys had picked up um and then it put me in gear follow through with the rest of the information because at this point in time the cuts that everybody made where we have contracts on employees if we go below that it's it's it's not we're avoiding contracts the budget advisor committee was not in line with your recommendation no oh absolutely not no no no no i'll i'll make that for the record no you're exactly right there was information in that i picked up did i use to get that number but not any recommendation no absolutely not well when i had that total i get seven million seven hundred and thirty eight thousand nine fifty higher than the consolidated extension sheet that we have in front of us well yeah because the one that's in front of you is the five million twenty thousand thank you so mr chair i make a motion and we run with the numbers 52 58 950 and motion do we have a second so i make the motion that we approve for that dollar figure instead of five two five eight we put five million either you know um i'll second so we can discuss a little bit more we had a motion in a second so we'll uh go for discussion so my thought on this is what you're proposing is going to put us at 25 and a half to 26 mil roughly if we look at the non-funded cips that puts us at 26 is what our prediction 26.5 is i'm just looking at it as if we're going to be at or 26 and we can be at 26 with our departments funded versus 26 without them funded i don't want to be at 26 to begin with it's not where i want to be i don't think that's where any of us want to be just think of what that percentage increases to our to everybody's family yeah that's like 24 25 no it's like 31 increase in taxes 30 and 31 percent 24 is approximately 25 percent i just feel like we're at a point where we can't afford what we have that's not what i want to say or do i just well it's okay so let's let's talk about that because that seems to be the theme here is that we can't afford what we have it's not about affording what we have it's about deciding what you want for services now we have given council what it costs to run those services that you are asking us to provide for the community that's what we're doing and whatever they cost is what it costs and then that's what the mill rate will be based on the budget that you vote in so it's not whether or not you can afford those services it's what you want to provide for services you have to let us know what it is that you expect we can only do so our pressure for our our side of things is that you expect from us a specific level of services to be provided for the citizens in the town hall here and you have now told us on multiple occasions that you're not going to fund what it costs to provide those services at that level that is being expected so whatever you give us for a number just like i told you previously before we will do whatever it is you tell us to do but you need to understand whatever that is may affect how services are run in the town of court fairfield fiscal year 22-23 so and that's like that's council's decision to make you by charter decide on what that is you hand that back to me and i facilitate that budget for the year but i have to let you know and remind you that it is going to affect services one way or the other whether it eliminates depletes however you want to talk about it and unable to afford it but you you have to understand it is it is basic black and white the services that are being required to be provided cost this much money we have presented that budget to you and what we think is fair and just for running those services in the community if you are adamant about a mill rate that we cannot provide for you today given that we can't do that until the fall because we do not run on a calendar year we run on a fiscal year then i i can't tell you honestly what that is i know you asked me to give you my suggestion of what that might be but i cannot give you a firm answer on that because i do not have all of the numbers i have all of the numbers on what it costs to run the services that are required of us by counseling but i don't have what that really looks like for a moment so the decision and it is a difficult one we know that we don't take this very lightly either we know that this is a very difficult decision for thousands we have because you are ultimately making the decision what to provide for the citizens of fort fairfield so we understand that and that's why we're asking you to clarify this tonight because what was given to us previously at the budget meeting june 15th doesn't give us that information and it's wrong for us to just work and spend money that doesn't exist that has not been voted on so i i understand that but i want to clarify it's not about that we can't afford it because you raise the taxes in any community in the state of maine based on the services that are provided that the budget is what it is to run those services now the mill rate gets set based on the other information that comes in so your your valuation your homestead your betty your veterans all of those things all calculate that mill rate in that formula for you at the end that's how you get a no rate and that's how you raise the taxes in order to pay for those services that you have budgeted for so it's not about whether afforded not afforded that source it's it's about what do you want to provide for services for citizens and you need to understand that when you come to a conclusion on a number that number will affect what is provided for sentences a good matter for other i mean that's just the way it is we've got services that we spent a lot of money for that we really probably should have spent the money for we should want to vote a different way keep our costs down now we're stuck with them now we're seeing results of those decisions that were made before someone's comments so i don't know how we're going to deal with it but taxes i think people are complaining about the capital they are depending on taxes and the taxes are high and nobody wants to pay a 26 no right for 25 or 24 yeah but the bills have got to be paid right and but i will remind council that that is not unusable before 28 building as a matter of fact is not unusual for foreign year by year for relevance and i've shared that information with thousands of patients so so the difference in the is not what we should be hung up on what we should be hung up on is what do you want to provide for services i think everybody wants the services because we just you gotta get the cost down i think getting it down by 1.4 million dollars is an excessive amount yeah i mean we're at the point where like you had made a motion at 5 million the difference in a final number of a mill ring on 5 million or the 258 000 you probably wouldn't even justify it would be roughly the same but if we if it's i know it's hard 5 million is what we need but we need the 258 000 to meet the minimum the need if you have the right budgets amounts locked in that's coming in and i feel comfortable with doing it right but we don't have those numbers we're missing someone and we have for the last couple years yeah every year every day be clear about this every year we do not have those numbers until the fall before mill ring is set that's why nobody has said that i'm so referrals this is not a new thing this happens every year and it's very difficult on my side of things to have to project what the state's going to do i don't know what that's going to be and again it's based on all of the rest of the work that the assessor's office does as well that affects our value well the difference between the straight 5 million and adding the two hundred and right now but they'll be lost in services with the i'm sorry say that again there'll be a lot more loss of services but if you think just you know right if you do five million yes because i'll have to cut an additional on top of the 437 586 i'll have to cut an additional 20 000 from the budgets that we already just cut in the 5 million 258 900 no the 5 million 20 0509 but the number that bob's proposing we wouldn't cut services no and that puts us at 25 and a half to 26 correctly janet mills made me very generous this year too we can't we should not be getting hung up on governor sharon either because that fluctuates so much between now and september as you see when we collect revenue sharing throughout the year that fluctuates as well so midway through the year we're seeing like a loss the percentage point we actually were over by 12 000 something this year in revenue share so it changes and it always seems to catch up at the end of the year if not go further but i don't ever you know put that i think that that's going to happen every year we have to you know the numbers that are given to us so the consolidated expense form that we have in front of us versus the number that bob is telling us is less than what's on there the number that is on the municipal expense side of the consolidated is that what you're asking yeah so the municipal revenue on here is uh and he's proposing municipal revenue as five million no is that not what you're saying oh oh okay okay okay just making sure so what do we have on the table right now just discussions yeah okay tell us i don't think we have any other option honestly doesn't look good when i add box number i get his is higher by two hundred and thirty eight thousand four hundred and forty one dollars but that keeps good yeah why don't we use it because it doesn't this is still cut of services what's on this paper this is off of the 850 4870 and it's a substantial cut thank you so that puts us at a deficit of one million two hundred and forty five thousand fifty six dollars figure one two hundred forty four thousand two hundred and one uh one million two hundred and forty five thousand fifty six dollars versus the one million six thousand six fifteen i mean i don't propose it's the perfect budget for no binomial but at this point where where it's at pages are going to be turned and we can move forward and like i say it's it's no extravagant so the difference is 238 441 but the departments are able to be funded right yes okay without cuts well i mean we already made cups right without additional with this we'll be able to put some of that back in there for them so that we're not seeing the excessive cuts in services and loss of job it's just it's just bare bones you're gonna get yeah about 26 26 meals roughly estimated and i mean if we get there's all kinds of yes we could get extra revenue sharing we could get we could get it's not going to get any worse you know at least you know this whole system is working so um foreign everything is very old and now the staff has brought back to conscious attention immediately and we are not fully funding our capital improvement plans research accounts um 2019 the council also decided not to fund those accounts and we are not planning for replacement of vehicles equipment programming any of that stuff so doing this puts us even further behind for that so i want council to be very clear that this doesn't mean that yes we can put some funds back into their their lines but that doesn't mean that you'll be seeing that same you know 2019-2020 fiscal year was a great year for the community we were able to get a lot accomplished we were able to put all those those accounts in all of the things that we did that helped us during the pandemic as a matter of fact we did all the investing all of the things that we did and we didn't have to borrow any extra money we didn't have to do anything unusual that year because we did those investments and we put that money in towards those vehicles and to programming the services um but since then since the pandemic we have just completely slashed back budget after budget this will be our third budget tool so every time you do that you are unable to upgrade your services for your citizens so that you're not able to do better with each year the cost for equipment does not go down it continuously goes up the cost for providing the services goes up it never goes down it's and it's the same and it really should be reflected in the mill range um and this is why we talk every time we go to set the mill rate council and i talk about the importance of having an overlay not always choosing the minimum no rate every time and putting yourself below an overlay having a deficit at that point in time even before you start with this little you know really get into your fiscal year like these are things that you have to keep in mind moving forward as well i just want us to understand that yes you know whatever number you you give me today you will work through but those decisions have consequences so we have to be conscious of that i looked at our long-term debt that do you want to vote for do you because i would like to discuss that if you don't find you made reference to the town being an outstanding principal donald's death of 4.1 million and we do not have an outstanding principle that have 4.1 million dollars we have a loan outstanding principal balance with the ambulances with aristic county savings and loan that has five years left on it so essentially nearly four years left on that phone and that's at two hundred and eleven thousand two hundred seventy five dollars and ninety one cents we have the ladder truck at four hundred and fifty thousand eight hundred six dollars and ninety eight cents also again at four years left we have the ems services that's 12 years left on that 15-year loan at 989 774.92 cents we have one year left of a paving bond with the state of maine at 51 970 and we have a five-year uh town office bond with the state of maine at 293 655 so as of yesterday afternoon at 4 30 our outstanding principal balance for the town of fort fairfield was 1 million 997 482 dollars and 81 cents not 4.1 million dollars do we have a loan out with the bank of boston no we have bonds paving bond and when they built the town office you know and at that amount there won't be anything there minor maintenance will be done i know so we think within four years you will be you will remove nine um 51 seventy dollars you will remove two hundred and eleven thousand two hundred seventy five dollars and ninety one cents you will remove four hundred and fifty thousand eight hundred and six dollars and ninety eight cents leaving you with under a million dollars um in outstanding principal death in four years that puts us into training we're in good shape right now yeah if if council would ask questions of the town manager's office i would be very happy to give that information but if i don't know what your questions are i can't answer those no we're we're very fortunate that we have department heads that take as serious in their jobs to do what they do and provide us with the services and it was tough this year to cut like we did and um you know we uh you know we're sorting but at this point we're still fortunate to have great department heads running for us we appreciate it everything and that's in that rundown of that dollar value it's it's it's it's a band-aid for this year that's a band-aid but it'll work nobody's going to get rich off that number on the five two eight five nine five one okay we'll go for both melissa hi yeah kevin they and i will die next we got c budget advisory committee ordinance background article 1 subsection c dash 15 a any ordinance which repeals or amounts in existing ordinances are part of the court crippled closure shall set out and fold the ordinance sections for subsections to be repealed or amended and shall indicate matter to be admitted by enclosing in its brackets or by strikeout type and shall indicate new matter by underscoring or by intelligence discussion the budget advisory committee ordinance 22-02 was voted on by council at the april 13 2022 council meeting the budget advisory committee needs direction from council how to proceed the recommendation is that council votes to repeal the budget advisory committee ordinance 22-02 we have a motion the uh just kind of question because the budget committee i mean was supposed to be working [Music] this ordinance circumvents the town manager's office completely which is how it's designed the budget committee works for you we advise you however the problem with that is that the budget committee is being giving given information not from us as a whole but from like pieces and you need to be able to have it one whole correct amount of information that i agree 100 so i struggled with that that the numbers we were given were not always right so you guys are doing all this work for nothing because you're not working off the correct numbers so if we don't circumvent the town manager's office and the information comes from the town office then you would be getting the correct most accurate view of the data the origin specifies that she will cooperate with us in our requests to be fair to the budget committee they need a year to perform oh absolutely however to be fair to the taxpayers that one person cannot supply the information to the budget committee and expect them to go with those numbers and then make a recommendation to us because they're not even having the correct numbers so i make a motion that we revise the ordinance for the budget committee so that it does not circumvent the town manager's office amen to amend yes to amend the ordinance 12 seconds but isn't the budget advisory committee getting information from the town manager right now no they're getting information from they can get it from the town office if i'm correct but they can also get it from us as counselors but we as the council shouldn't be individually feeding them information is what i'm saying because then they're they're forming a bias in in getting information from like say you think one thing and i think another thing and you're feeding them all this information then you can bias the committee and the committee should not be biased the committee should work off of solely the information the correct information and form their own opinions we shouldn't give them our opinions because then it completely messes up the whole way that they should be operating they'll get their information just like we get it but follow through what you're saying but then we need a hearing on this then i think we should have a hearing because it doesn't it doesn't work the way that it was sure mr chair and the counselors if your vote is to amend the existing ordinance what needs to be done it needs to be crafted send it to the town council with recommendations from the town council town manager at that point if it is introduced there will be a public hearing advertised and held after the public hearing is advertised and held you have you have to have a second council meeting which could be the same night as that public hearing at the time that you're discussing considering the amended ordinance if that's what happens you have three options you can approve the ordinance as presented you can deny the ordinance as presented or you can mend the ordinance on the floor based on comments that you receive anything else strike this word add this word whatever it is but that's the process if you vote to amend that ordinance it would come back to you and then be introduced and so on so forth we have to carry on business i feel that that they have worked hard in what they had for information they served their duties well i think it would be well suited for them to to gain access like we are able to gain access from the town manager along with we've all learned first little curveball here you know and i apologize to the committee many times doesn't make it right i they hit the floor with their feet just running and and we knew we were going to make mistakes but i think adding from what we've learned it would only benefit the budget committee i'll share with you my perspective okay we will put in a room we had a freedom of access presentation on that computer we were left to our own devices no direction no guidance no nothing okay so if we failed and again this is kevin speaking not the budget community if we failed in our attempts to do what we perceived we were supposed to do tell us what you want us to do and tell us how you want us to do it and i'm pretty sure that to me we'll respond to your requests it amazes me how well this group of seven works together you know jim's been to some meetings you've been to a few meetings it's it's a phenomenal group of people that i never in 100 years would have thought things so to be clear what i'm asking for is the ordinance to be repealed not the budget advisory committee because the ordinance as it stands is again as mr bouchard stated they were just thrown into it there was no direction there was no um training there was no information there is no chain of hearing information there was nothing that would indicate to them what it takes to provide information for the council budget advisory committees across the country not just in the state of maine across the country do work with their managers offices because many of them are in charge of the budget how are you to get your information if you are not working with that office that provides that information there's a lot of miscommunication a lot of opinions as opposed to facts that are shared because they have nothing else to go on and so i can't because the ordinance does not allow me to and that is how no my integrity and my job is very important to me and that ordinance circumvents my office completely as you said by design and i for one do not agree with that because if you want a true and just system that actually is working for the benefit of the citizens then you need to have the office that prepares the budget part of what they're doing and giving that information the only thing i could give you is what i gave council to begin which i provided every member of the budget advising committee with and that took a long time because it took a long time to put all of that information together for all of you then i had to do it seven times again so it's important that council really think about this i i would like to see an entire new ordinance proposed that's what i would like council to do and it should be one that's not written by a counselor it needs to come from the office that provides the budget and the town attorney to make sure that it is not because if this ordinance does not follow the charter at all so i think it's important that we put something else in all together because as it stands now it is ineffective and we've seen if you've watched any of the movies it's not the purpose of a budget advisory committee is to discuss a budget not personnel because by charter the town manager is the only one who is affected by personnel hiring firing all of that um you shouldn't be discussing anything other than the budget that is presented in front of you so and and that comes from training and learning and discussing how to run the budget advisory committee meetings and the purpose of what that is it can be a very successful thing if done properly but putting that on them in such a short amount of time is unfair i don't want to use that term very often but it is unfair and it it it was a lot in a very short amount of time we work with the budget year round literally year round so just because you vote on a budget tonight that doesn't mean that ends that is literally the beginning for me and it doesn't and as a matter of fact we move on to the next year's budget while we're currently in the fiscal year budget after august so in november we are already looking at fiscal year 23 24 and if we have a budget advisory committee that can come up through that process with us they can see how that works why we do what we do how why we have the meetings that we have and they can be participating in those things and those discussions moving forward whereas it was very separated the department heads myself and the budget advisory committee so i this is why i have given the recommendation that we vote to repeal the budget if you would like to just amend that budget that's you're welcome to do that um i'm not going i'm happy to motion that we can repeal the budget advisory committee but i want to make sure that we get another ordinance put in place because i think that the budget advisory committee can be very effective i think we set them up for failure and i think that was a nothing of their doing they did not have all of the correct information they worked off of what they had they had no direction they're very smart people trying to do the best they could to help the town and they need to have a better setup to be able to operate so you don't need to change the ordinance to do that we you can work within this version i just think that if i didn't i didn't vote on this ordinance to begin with because i didn't think it was written correctly to begin with so for me personally i would like to see a completely new ordinance not that i want a new committee not that i want a different committee that's not the case it's it's the way that the ordinance is written for me if council should so choose to repeal this ordinance and would like to see a new one for the july council meeting i can make sure that that is a primary process i would like to see that because i do i didn't want the committee to begin with because of i was worried that there would be so much extra conflict but with the people that we have on the committee i think there's a lot of really good well educated people that can help us if it's done correctly and i don't think this is correct and by doing it in july it begins the entire process that's right for them from the beginning of the fiscal year to the end of the fiscal year and what goes on in between that process will be caught everywhere so they will be fully educated moving into the next round versus a month before they were to give proper wording to add to this so i guess i'll just rephrase the motion is that we repeal the current budget advisory committee ordinance and ask the town manager to rewrite a new ordinance for us to review at the next council meeting what does your charter provide for the procedure the ordinances are supposed to come through the town manager's office well at this time but they don't write adding to this amendment to a new i would like legal advice added attorney courier told counsel this already okay to what we would define the words that would work he recommended we don't circumvent the town manager's office shouldn't be dropping off from ordinance to his office when the town manager is called out of state well as long as as long as the legal wording is sufficient for for both and and um i just wanted that added to it of course but we've had a motion and a second any other discussion we'll go forward so if you repeal the ordinance by removing all of the members on the committee we all understand that they're all removed as the dogs of this vote is that correct in adding to the amendment can we add also that the members that have been elected for their seat continue yes they're not i think it's it's again ineffective if you don't because if you disband what we've just started right and you're wanting to bring them through this i just want to make sure that nothing changes why would you why would you get rid of what you have well i'll get rid of the budget committee we're just getting this ordinance right everywhere in the world right right i'm going to amend that to it so it isn't going to circumcise anybody that's on it no it's going to go through legal we're going to have we'll have another yeah um so we go for vote melissa hi mitch hi jim kevin warning the way it's both be worth they work with the town manager and also the committee that is on board right now stay the same okay we had a motion second okay so next we got the medical insurance refund this is from television past practice for any full-time employee being reimbursed for medical insurance has been for the reimbursement amount to become part of their payroll with the gross adjustment this requires the employee to pay taxes spica and retirement when the amount reimbursed this also requires the town to pay fica and retirement on these amounts with council's approval uh ms leighton's suggestion is that we change this practice to issuing each employee a town check for the amount of returning personnel checks would be a medical insurance reimbursement issued by weekly to remain the same as if it was part of payroll by issuing a town check we would save the town the following amounts for mid administration two thousand six hundred six dollars and eighty seven cents public works one thousand one hundred fifty four dollars and twenty eight cents from the police department two thousand seven hundred forty three dollars and seventy cents and from the rec department one thousand one hundred fifty dollars and twenty eight cents total savings for the town is seven thousand six hundred fifty five dollars and sixteen cents with the council please approve the above suggestion affected payroll ending 630 in a second any discussion no we'll go for melissa mitch jim hi kevin and i will die next we got the library board of trustee nominations background we have two library board of trustees positions open and that needs to be filled by june 30th 2022 mr kenneth stratton term expires june 30th 2024 mr john house term expires june 30th 2025. discussion we had four applications ms annette thompson mr dan foster mr james smith and mr kenny peters the recommendation is that town council appoints miss annette thompson to fulfill the term ending june 30th 2025 and mr james smith to fulfill the term ending june 30th 2024 to the library board of trustees second got a motion and second any discussion if not melissa aye man kevin hi jim and i will die if there's anything else to add in other have a motion to adjourn all in favor say aye is okay [Music],True

there's two yeah paula quinn and the other lady yeah and the other is just one choice i mean unless you'll be able to go right in so i mean it wasn't that dramatic thank you [Music] four yes yeah because you didn't look if it wasn't right there in front of them yeah i had one when i did home care that every time i was like a singer you know because there are same times for a sale that was good all my closet and i'm right you don't need to buy a shampoo for two years like she's getting a big resume i'll say gallons or you know what i mean yeah they go on sale you talked to her today she said she was going to email me well you know for six dollars yeah i looked at that and there's what six attachments yeah well i got that's what i'm sorting through right now to see if it makes sense though was other cuts we've got i think probably a lot of jesus jesus identifying suggestions you know so yeah was there some magical change of heart over the weekend i have no idea um you know i'm not supposed to be a meeting no reason okay uh council didn't vote yeah at the workshop no so i don't know i i called this morning what i called about was i wanted to uh reconciliation that she showed me you know to show you you know whatever the numbers to reconcile with the attacks uh i think i is i am that year but [Music] um folks like call this meeting to order 602 i think you received your minutes by email if you've had a chance to look at those [Music] four o'clock this morning [Music] and i do have some handouts for each of you should be counselor [Music] president advised the document came from one town council the council of the council letter b is my statement that i read attached to the notes seven minutes yep because that's what i wanted i didn't want you know right so yeah i need to put like a quick blurb about it like just just put a c copy attached or something like that i don't expect you to type the whole thing and that's why when i do stuff like that i come prepared and i hand it out to everybody yep okay and then roman numeral four b maybe i think too much in french or something town manager thank the budget advisory committee for the work and the work i don't understand you that would make sense yeah all right no don't don't any other changes that should be made if all right yeah okay new business uh i handed some handouts out talked to the town manager earlier today and she said she'd be emailing these i asked her if they would have coffees made for us i haven't had obviously any chance to review those that what i was told is they one should be close to what their original budget plans were one i believe we're going to emit reserve accounts adding to reserve accounts then there is a third proposal that we're going to cut make some cuts and adjustments in a part of different departments and i don't know what those are uh obviously it's going to take some time to go and digest this and say 24 hours that's right so i mean i i don't think we can accomplish that this evening looking at it i don't see one that looked like the original budget at all they all look like they're down looking at the consolidated at the end one i think the first one had a deficit of one million eight hundred and twenty four thousand the next one showed a deficit of 1 1 292 456 dollars that's significant and uh so those are the bottom lines on those but what what got changed that they say now is the town's commitment of 150 000 and only put 5 000 in reserve so it's still there so i will have to review these and analyze but i don't know i don't know what's going to occur tomorrow evening did this get turned on yes okay good you know they spoke as far as i know it's on their agenda to vote on the budget so it would be interesting to see another handout i gave was just their backup valuation book for the backup information that he sent to the state that is involved in the computation of the it's all the municipal evaluation report returned and it's the form it's the it's ten pages of data yeah that supports the tax rate calculation form correct yeah and there again i haven't had a chance to go through that and i still need some reconciliation numbers for the noise the actual form so for this evening that information isn't all that useful uh i guess i would like to kind of state that i'm disappointed that that council had two meetings since we did our recommendation they never publicly said what our recommendation was the 470 000 increase and never voted on them you know so where is that did they just i agree that they you know they didn't even acknowledge receiving it i mean they did and i've had a conversation with the chairman that you know sees a number but no action taken or like i said nothing publicly said what our recommendation was while we are talking about our recommendations if you allow me yes i would like to go on record as with drawing my support for our recommendation okay that's fine but i mean no no we have a motion and it's been done yes i can't reverse it but and that's not what i'm asking you i just want to go make a statement yes that i am no longer in favor of the motion that we made if you want my logic i'll share it with you if you don't want it i'll keep it to myself if you wish to share it please do we we've been working under the illusion that a tax a mill rate of 19.5 met the budgeted request approved for 2122. 19.5 does not i think billy joel made a comment to that in one of our earlier meetings okay it's my understanding that we're short 729 thousand dollars between what should have been raised in property tax revenue and the bills that went out am i off track really well if i'm understanding that you're referring to the fact that they wanted the 22 mill rate and they the council won in the 1950s the 22 is what the recommended one was to support a good an overlay i believe and then council wanted to keep it at the minimum of 19.5 if that's what i believe you're saying well one one right there's a flaw in the tax rate calculation form there's been at least four attempts that i'm aware of made to the town office for an explanation i'm not aware of anyone that's gotten an answer but as i understand the forum and as i understand the english language on the tax calculation revenue sharing is counted twice and the revenue sharing number on that form is almost 729 000 when you make that correction the mill rate that comes out of the is in the 22 23 year not 1925. i gotta at this point i have to hand it to the departments a lot of us have beat up on the department heads the department heads for 2122 have lived within the budgets that were approved last year okay i i i gotta eat quality crop but my feeling kudos to them for living up to their deal these facts are not department head issues or town office issues so we're short almost three quarters of a million dollars to the best of my knowledge going back at least 10 years the town has never had the ball reminder to finish the fiscal year we just had to borrow 275. the request that was made aws was 600. they paired it down to 275. i don't see i haven't read these okay i'll acknowledge them but so far from what i've seen i don't see anything inwards where the money comes from to pay that 275. because all the money raised from property taxes goes to cover expenses there's no provisions there for that okay i believe the town has a 600 hundred thousand dollar loan paying due at the end of this month where's that money what's coming back to the three-quarters of a million dollars which was short i don't see where the money is to make up for that we can't ask the department head sport because they lived out to their end of the deal okay you know and i gotta wonder is there something else that's floating around i don't know what i mean reconcile that tax calculation form i spoke with the town manager this morning about getting a copy of the form and a reconciliation of that i went in the town office around two didn't get it but tonight we've got this packet of tony's backup material for it but i still haven't gotten the form or the reconciliation town manager after last meeting town meeting last week thursday shared with me hand-written notes that she said reconciled the form and that's what i asked her to share with me so at this point i don't want to comment that that's there is a shortage or not or the form is wrong i i can't i haven't been able to verify that as of yet and so i'm i don't want to be on record saying yeah but nobody's missing i'm not asking i'm just asking for that that's fine you know so i'm not going to let it go i'll pursue it i'll get it figured out when you do it will you share it oh absolutely i don't know where you're getting those numbers from or wherever so that no i'll share it with our group for sure yeah yeah but uh like i said i don't want to make a comment one way or the other i give everybody a chance to show the conversation and verified i uh council person libby said she reviewed it with a manager and felt comfortable with it that there wasn't an error made so [Music] i agree two of the requests to the town office were made by me yeah over three weeks ago you you know one of the difficulties they have they have and the way that our committee was set up is we're accountable to the town council and our information to go to them so it makes it i it's been cumbersome for whom for us you know to be able to get information i think oh to get information the the the wording the structure of the budget advisory committee comes directly from any municipal association i spoke to the authors call me municipal they'll tell you they'll share they'll share their form with you we'll the only logical way for a budget advisory committee to work is to answer to the town of council manager she made it crystal clear to me in my meeting with her but she's really pissed that the budget advisory committee answers to the council not to her okay town council is the one that approves budgets oh yes they're not not a town manager and it's the only logical way to have a budget advisory i agree i mean it's the town council that we're working for and you're trying to recommend too it's structured for the authority correct correct and the problem that we're having is we're not getting information from the town council we're not getting it from um listen you're 100 right we're not getting any communication from the town council what we've received has been from one town council maybe two but that's but there's no verification and there's there's if the whole council isn't on board we shouldn't be getting anything that's right because we're operating under assumptions and that's not yeah okay so we haven't gotten anything from the town council and that's been an issue so far you can look at how we've been organized how we've been treated how we've been set up and i have to wonder was there an attempt for us to be structured to fail and i have no intentions of us failing i speak for myself here failure is not something i had there's a lot unclear and i know i we spoke of that for the last thursday night yeah and actually ended asking for either direction direction or disbanding and i understand that yeah and i also asked for them to address our recommendations didn't happen again so i had some observations like just personal ones from their meeting with the department his last week but i i've got a long business history and i've worked i've seen lending and finance for several years and i worked a lot of different businesses and i noticed one of the things our department heads were saying they were looking for direction as well he said you know we prepared this but you know if you want something different or he wants feedback i didn't see any feedback to it and that's a red flag in business i mean i've seen key managers it might be a supervisor could be on a farm or a business begging for direction from owners or managers if they don't get it things are going to fail and i it's just an observation i had that i didn't see anything now maybe they get feedback other times but that isn't proper it's supposed to be in their time meetings where in these those type of meetings with the department where they there's exchange and feedback yes sir if you live in the interruptions the department heads do not answer to this no they are a town manager correct yeah you know and in a functioning community the town manager and town council sit down and negotiate you know you go back to the beginning the public elects the council the council hires the manager you'd like to think the manager and the council are working together cooperatively and then it's up to the manager to work with his or her department heads and implement what the town council is yeah i agree 100 kevin but i guess my my point is that feedback necessary doesn't have to come from a council member but the council is going to be talking with the manager town manager if they feel that okay you need to adjust this or that yeah okay another thing i you know the department heads and the town manager in speaking to the council uh quoted full service for a full service community and and you know department heads would say well if we're going to provide the services that people want but i don't think my opinion is we can't afford to be a full service and i think that's what they're reluctant to look at uh maybe they got to scale services down in any areas where they can um and you know people keep comparing us to caribou and breast aisle terrorism seems to we should be able to keep up with caribbean press style we've got a municipal evaluation 2122 for approximately 186 million dollars yes i do not have the specific numbers for care when press style but i do know that it's one freaking huge number to ours yeah okay so it's apples and oranges you can't compete you know no no you're foolish to try to compete i'm not saying have no services i'm not trying to pick on woodland but offer your community what woodland offers its community it's just that's only the night the town that comes to mind that's not where i'm suggesting the direction you take but i think you're correct there's got to be a middle ground somewhere yeah i mean you can only suck so much money out of the community and the taxpayers of the community and at some point it's going to go by and i think we're on that path right now and you know that leads me to my third observation i mean they talk about citizens and services that you don't hear too much about the taxpayer and those are the people who have to pay the bill and you know we we have a there's a lot of citizens that probably don't pay any property taxes you know directly at least they may in forms of rent or whatever but but uh you know you you can't ignore the taxpayer it isn't it isn't right to and if you do in the long run is going to get you in the body well it's the one voice that we've almost heard nothing from yeah in the entire process yeah i mean we've heard from the department heads we've heard from the town manager then we've had some a few concerned citizens we've expressed higher thoughts that's why i said we have which i i appreciate yes we got criticized for listening to them but i'll take that criticism they're upset and you know um things could have been done better way but somehow i agree yes so in order to look at cutting services in order to keep this um as dan foster used to call it a bedroom community what what services are we all willing to give up yeah well especially especially since the budget as it's presented and it exists more than covers the expenses of the services being provided to the tenant yes it does the difference is the school budget and the county budget walk away from them everybody else covers their school and their budgets we we always have had the school budget and the county taxes they have increased number 10 i agree not at we also have a time period right now how many houses are for sale and available maybe five maybe five we've got a lot of new people who've moved into this community and they have services they check these communities out to find out what services are available and they move here for those services and we offer those services we either stay stuck as a bedroom community from the 1980s where we start to look forward and do something to support services in this town and provide a living environment for people to move to instead of keeping us with nothing to offer we have an empty main street we have all kinds of parking lots on main street but there's not a lot of cars to be parked there is there i think we can cut off our nose despite our face and what are we in what do we end up with you know i think there's there's got to be a happy medium and i'm not sensing there's a willingness at all for compromise exactly there's two sides and both sides are are at odds and butting heads both sides are convinced they're right there's nobody willing to make any kind of compromises um where do we go from here then you know do we destroy the town with infighting and i mean the department heads and the town manager and the people who work for the town have put up with a lot of questions a lot of rudeness a lot of a lot of people coming into the office asking questions and not a nice way there's been some serious confrontations there's a learning curve for new counselors on the town council they don't just step into the job and know everything so not everything that they know is correct and there's a lot of information being presented in the town that is inaccurate somewhere along the line there has to be common sense and there has to be a happy medium if as you say where there's a huge shortfall of seven hundred thousand dollars we need to know that we're not going to know it or find out about it if we've got the town management so upset and on guard that they're having a hard time to share that stuff we shouldn't we should have access to that but we shouldn't in that sense be going directly to the town manager and asking for that information we need to be going apparently through the town council and having them ask for them i i agree pat that's the way it should be but the problem is we had four freaking weeks we didn't have a lot of time but we do for this next one but this this year i i don't know i don't know whatever we do it's not going to make any difference to what the council votes on tomorrow night i don't believe at this point and they've got a big job they don't i really it all falls on them and they have to weigh that they have to try to benefit so and i know there's a lot of questions and everything but the three people who've been on the council for a while now have not done a bad job but it seems to me that everybody thinks they have i'm not sure let me address my thoughts on how we address the budget issue okay everybody comes to a table first we get our knowledge we have a problem okay if we can't get to that point acknowledging that we have a budget problem in our community we're wasting our time but if we can agree that we have a budget problem okay and everybody needs to come to the table ready to talk about how can we make these budgets work for this community and every it's it's going to be painful there's not there's no easy way to fix this and you can probably have a little bit more experience than i do in this stuff but there's gonna there's gonna be a lot of pain for a lot of people okay but the first thing we've got to do is everybody's gotta be willing to sit down and try to work our way through this thing um you know if the taxpayers dig their heels in and say we're not going to pay our bills we're not going to live under okay the department heads dig their heels and no we gave you a bare bones budget we can't change anything you know and we just get this head-butting thing well and it depends on the approach i mean if you approach it as as a willingness to work and come up with compromises and make it happen but if you come at it as an approach of attacking either the management or the departments or the taxpayers or if there's an attack stance you're going to find defensiveness and you know so if people are on the defense all the time communication is going to float isn't going to flow both ways it's going to flow one way and it isn't in a positive way the reason i got on this budget committee was to find some form of positivity and um educational experience i mean i don't know municipal budgets but i do know that we're not going to get anywhere by causing hard feelings and by disrupting the people on the council or in town management that's your expertise it is it is and there's nothing wrong with that it's just it's i mean that's i don't know where we go if we continue to butt heads if it's if it's it doesn't matter what comes out of this office it's wrong and it doesn't matter what comes out of this office it's wrong you're not going to get anywhere how are you going to make somebody who believes they're right admit they're wrong yeah and i know on a firsthand level too that the morale and departments is very very very low and i was really upset to learn that the police department is one of them very low very very disappointed and they're just very yeah and that's to me from working here you know and that was one thing i didn't want for me to get targeted as um you know i've worked there before but that's when you start hearing that that it's you know i don't know i just i hate to see the morale and all the departments start just going to crap because there are shortages in those departments all over the state and they can go anywhere they want and we're going to lose especially i don't want to go back to the sheriff's department because you couldn't go anywhere you might need to come to still there and there wasn't even any syndrome anyhow that's being court but they were there their response time was what i know but that's one and how many i mean i don't want to be negative i'm just saying yes they did a great job but there's other ones that aren't um and that's it's not yeah let's just pick up you can't just take the good ones you got to show that there are some that need improvement and um so i think but i do know they're feeling attacked on a personal level and not their professional level and not their ability to do their jobs well for the town they do they are passionate you get your deputy fire chief up here cracking his voice in tears trying to you know express what he feels about his department and his people that's deep i'm sorry that's just libby mrs libby yeah she she had she was out there upset and i went out and talked to her i mean she's very passionate about this she sees it exactly the way ever you know fairly it's not right on the taxpayer it's not you know but right no one wants to do anything just like jason said crickets yeah but there's been there's been so many direct attacks on department heads department members town members italian management members we're better than if they're direct attacks and that yeah we are better than that i didn't know there was people attacking the department heads personally made that there are specific town department heads that are going to be forced to leave their positions because they're going to be made so miserable and uncomfortable that's not okay well i mean just just in the other meeting cody had you know ones that were i don't want to say job shopping but they didn't feel confident that they'd have a job next month right i mean that's not a way to live i mean they have who knows they might have family they might have kids they might have i know but we still can't go a million in the hole it's true the fire ems department right now is is literally feeling that they were set up to fail yep and they're two what two years into the development or three three third and when all of the meetings were being held as to whether or not we should have that department everybody supported it it put the department in place and there were discussions at that time that said within three years this is going to start hitting and we're going to start feeling the effect and that's where we're at and we are i mean i i know i looked at their schedule lot of debt i debt it's going to be paid and even if you're disbanded and say you're done tomorrow those debts are still there you've got two ambulances or whatever sitting there just there there are serious problems and we cannot point to one department or one person as being the cause and that is what's been happening no i agree it should not be there is the authority and that's your town council it's up for them to make those judgments and i think our work is well it's done what we have we we've taken it it's as a total i mean we've we've got a wide spectrum opinions here and that's great i mean that should be uh but it would be a steamroller if there wasn't a difference of opinions that's right and you know i appreciate that together and we agreed on what we felt they should pursue and beyond that as of tonight i don't see what else we can do until you're until we get some direction until we get some direction so i'll uh let me share a comment um the town council came to me and apologized for the abuse that we took at the meeting the other night no no no no no i took it as a compliment you know i we're doing the best we can nobody ever likes a budget car that's a completely thankless job and you know to to think that you're you're going to make some recommendations that might force people to spend a little bit less money they're not going to like that i took it as a compliment i'm sorry but just as we talked about you know startup of the ems system and yes this room was filled but count those chairs and then look at our population so the people that did come out they did support it the council could only take what they received for the people who showed up or have written comments this is also too why the frustration lies within the school system you go to the school budget meetings if you go to the school budget meetings i will attest i haven't been to them i do go to when i go to the when they vote but i don't go through the school board meetings i do try to watch them um but by the time that rolls around it was a 27-4 vote so you had 31 people make the decision of what the school is going to ask of the town so if more people don't get involved it's almost like you know chuck clark always said if you don't vote you don't have a right to know about it i probably mitch butler the other night when he said if if the state recommends this is what this town can afford for the school and the school submits a budget that's over a million dollars more almost it was 900 more yeah it was like okay so why and the school can justify it just like anybody can justify their budget again you know i made several suggestions no i didn't know the council council meet with the superintendent of the school board throughout the year sure and during that planning process and plant the seeds that this is the community you know struggling keep it you know just and have them aware of that has that been done in the bathroom yes yes there was a meeting i saw that yeah my name is chairman i had three i think three different meetings but superintendent one was with council and we had a meeting with select people from the school board and their in the superintendent and you know it it was dialogue they got into their budget process we made some suggestions their budget to process at that time they were not doing any reserves they just okay this year we need a school bus boom 100 well and then we so it's a town we'd be sitting there big jump that you know it's an example and so uh hopefully i think they picked up some practices from that but that dialogue is helpful at least they get the vibe of where the community is or the town and vice versa uh you know we get insight of you know what their labor issues are what are they going to be required to pay you know there's more of a better understanding i've been to school budgets in the past school budget meetings in the past but not this year probably shouldn't wow but i can speak for me and there's a whole lot of other people in this town also that have been involved yeah i agree me too but that would be helpful this is going to be a difficult year because inflation hasn't stopped yet it's going to continue to grow and you know that's scary because it's it's a request for more taxes from the taxpayers for more money from the taxpayers and you know we're all being stressed as it is there's no happy medium but yeah do you have any thoughts on where a reasonable rate um if the price of fuel and the price of services price of everyday living continues to grow i don't know what any town is going to be able to come up with what do you think is fair for this town for the mill rate what's a reasonable tax bill on the property i mean i know there's a lot of people that are upset no no it's the mill rate is what i'm asking you for i don't think that that's a number that you can throw out because you don't know what revenue sharing is going to be you don't know what the state is going to come up with it's called no you have some guesses i'm going to say probably between 22 and 24. how about between 30 and 35 i don't think that's a number that's going to happen you sit with me after the meeting and i'll show you how it might happen i don't want to speculate any more than throw another number of 22 to 24. i mean that's that [Music] from july one of last year for june 30 of this year the town council decided in 1945 because there was a lot of pressure from the community members to do something about the taxes it was a lot out of this last year was a mess if you lower the tax rate to satisfy that without lowering your expenses how do you make that work i know that's what i'm trying to say and particularly exactly so now we got that extra money so now it's going to be an even bigger whammy this year absolutely that's why we've got to get it cut down so that you know you have to you can't be in the town can't be borrowing money they're not just isn't it shouldn't be happening and that's i mean i don't even know where you start with that because we listened to all of the department heads last week we listened to all of their budgets their worst since march since march yeah i've learned a lot but there's i mean what are you going to tell people to cut melissa sat here and said these are my recommendations and all of the recommendations that she made made a difference in that department's budget but everything she recommended was a drop in what we think right and one question it was not going to affect the tax at all like if you if you cut what melissa suggested it wasn't going to change the military because it's such a minou it'll change it but it's not going to be a huge change it's not right it might be a mill or two or something like that so then what would you recommend if those changes aren't going to make a drop in the bucket then what do you do what i recommend is we figure out how much money we can suck out of the community go backwards figure out how much money can you pull out of the community and before you even do that get a look at your debts it's one of one of my big big big concerns we've borrowed all kinds of money here and you know municipal budgeting and finances are a little bit different than mine i've seen loans that are characterized as income struggle with that but i suppose if you want to put everything on your income statement and everything on the expense statement not anywhere else that's maybe one of the ways to do it but you got to look at the big picture we can't look just at departmental expense extends budget you can't look just at loans you got to put the whole freaking picture together not all has to cash flow and it all has the cash flow and work you're 100 right so you you get an accurate i'd say spend a couple bucks and hire an accountant don't take my word don't take your word don't take tom's word hire a competent accountant to say here's where you sit today by the portfolio here's the debt you have here's the income you have so many of the products no the audits are to make sure that entries are made correctly they're checking our procedures in place for adequate protections and are the numbers right generally correct and so forth but they're not it isn't located no consultants there's no consulting you [Music] they're just looking to make sure that the accounting procedures are done properly but that that's what you you got to have a complete picture of where you're at okay yeah and then okay so here's our commitments like i said all along every one of these budgets can be justified no questions whatsoever every one of these budgets can be rejected just as legitimately as they can be justified it's all functioning where you're coming from what what you think is important what i think is important but confidence is important and you know so get a total picture of where you're at get a cash flow of everything and how much can you take from taxpayers without a revolt i don't have an answer [Music] and you've got to keep in mind a dollar for jason might not be the end of the world a dollar for billy joe might be the end of the world because of life situations so you can't go up to i mean in all fairness you can't say you pay a dollar you paid two janet you're good yeah you can't do that exactly right right everybody gets an extra 100 bucks this week yeah i mean and it's it's just not fair it's going to be rough there are some people that are going to question you know expenses i've seen it already where they're worried and trying to cut back and their ssi and their whatever is not enough yeah and with the oil like plants have like the heat and everything in this winter and those tax bills it's gonna be there's gonna be some tears but we do need to find a happy medium where the town can run at you know i'll say flatline basis you know where police can go out and the cruisers aren't falling apart you know stuff like that you know highway departments salting in the winter but you know maybe shed less tears or you know what i mean right it's going to go up but they need to you know and it's gonna hurt but we're trying but you know we again i haven't seen what came out today you know until today i've been working with a projected two million dollar shortfall 700 rounded up 729 thousand dollars shortfall in last year's levels 275 000 that could borrow from aws that's going to be paid back in six months i'm over three million that's just three items still have on the books monies from energy plan yeah that's still in their tax revenue and the only thing that amber's good force you know i'm not sure if it is or not we don't know so it wasn't last year yeah were you on the council when the energy left budgets were adjusted energy left were the town budgets adjusted for that loss of revenue i think you could take a look at the sheets that are passed out this year and you can probably gather that information on those sheets what i guess not two years ago it would have been when the buildings were actually taken down yeah you know i think that's part because it was taxable revenue and taxable property as far,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,5TkhHMk7oPY,Budget Advisory Committee 6.14.22 (2),,13.0,780.0,2022-06-15T20:31:06Z,none,12,0,0,0,yeah i think that was probably the 1920 fiscal year but i'm not sure yeah that sounds right i think it was during that time period but wasn't the town eligible for a sudden severe when you lose i'm thinking part of the argument between the town and the energy and the tunnel's right and re-energies wrong in well it's it's a perception if they were in town right right they're from a way they don't care about us so the question is what happens with that because i mean that makes it important residents wanted you know the town to pursue legal care yeah and i think it should be done i don't know how much is gonna cost but if there's a snowball's chance to even get that money we need to get it i mean if it's something again it's not in our world but right if it's something they want to pursue every day it makes it harder to reach out yes kevin it looks as though from fiscal year 1819 to 1920 it looks like the expenditures went from 5.26 million to 5.5 5.634 according to the information we were given on june 9th 22 so there was a little increase that year okay folks i don't know i i don't have any other business but i don't want to schedule a meeting for next tuesday i guess wait until you hear and we'll find out what they're doing and see what they want us to do whether how can they give us some directions or how about if we schedule a meeting for the tuesday after the july council meeting the schedule meeting not any special meeting i'm leery about saying let's put ourselves on hold until we get some direction because people might try really really really again 100 speculation yeah people might try really really hard let's just not give them any information and see where it goes you know so i well i don't know what the council's feeling is that you know like you you say yeah they will meet on the 20th probably i don't know that'd be the third week of july i don't know what do you think the rest of you think we want to get together following that meeting or problem i mean i agree we've got to get some direction from what then i wonder is that festival week two it's just after that yeah it's the week after yeah i suspect they're going to have a handful tomorrow night might be wrong it might be a 20-minute meeting i'd like to give them a little bit more time than less time well yeah so they're going to need a meeting yeah i know this i know there's a special meeting scheduled next week yeah but and maybe i'm giving them too much money but i just no i it would take i mean they their normal practice is a monthly meeting and july would be that meeting hopefully that i can communicate with the chairman the council that you know you should have on your agenda what you want from us so so you know solve that that night so we can have something in hand the next day but that sounds reasonable yeah what do you guys think they can't do it tomorrow and and if they have another meeting between them then it's specific for a purpose so uh i mean they would have the right to take out our question at any special meeting if they so yes again i just rather give them more leeway than less and not be pushing although we deserve an answer and we should have had an answer when we started asking but we can't change any questions any questions this year i have a motion to adjourn what was your case let's see excuse me your date 26 july 26th yes because they lost the 22nd i mean the 20th they meet the 20th so we meet the 26. yeah they're they're on a wednesday we're on tuesday yeah they're on the 20th movie on the 26th oh well you want to meet the following week not on thursday then okay i think i thought kevin said thursday so no okay so we'll plan the 26th yeah i mean tuesday works well for me we haven't had that i think i got that that's interesting that's what we agreed to do and see if we get close and uh yeah all right we've got one two three four five weeks yeah yeah so i'll have plenty of yeah aaron's been doing it i did it this past week because he was out of town and i did it on the way through i was working up north this weekend so i had to run back down okay okay so we've got a motion from kevin to a droneware second yeah thank you complaining about you've got to take it for granted that somewhere something's being recorded visually [Music] we're gonna come in on the 26th and there's gonna be deodorant to listen [Music] this was probably one of the best discussions with that i mean nothing got done the only come again [Music] this afternoon really yeah and uh he asked if i would meet him tomorrow he would like to get a summary of this meeting if we you know anything out of it that would impact what they want to do and i think one of the things i will i'll put telling he's in charge of seeing that i get x y and z and c i gotta believe she's stalling huh i think she's stalling well i can't can't this is a seat of the pants cormorant i know i know but i talked to the woman on the phone this morning and she said yeah i'll type that right up and i said well i'm going to be in the vote shortly after lunch she said well our office closed 12-1 i said i'm aware that i'm the day after one and she said i'll have that for you so i came in at two and she was in the area she said everything is going to be ready and on your desk and in there tonight and she said but and i said well can you email me that schedule because i want to review it so i could come here tonight and say speaking tell us you're right or you're wrong you're wrong yeah you know i and i told her bluntly i said we have some members that are doubting that and i said i looked at it and it made me raise my doubts and i said let's put this issue to bed and the way for you to do that is give me the form and the reconciliation okay she said and i said that's best for you it's best for our group and it's best for everybody jim well let's ask the same question and i never get it jim hasn't gotten either so mr kilcalls will hear that tomorrow and see where that i don't think i know nothing's gonna happen but uh you know i don't i like to give them i'd like to give everybody a benefit and not accuse anything until i know but when i know that that's part of why i've gotten a little bit blunter with my my comments i can the more i ask the more i'm convinced that my math is right and you know if it's off it's off by tens of thousands not,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,FfdBBHTOKQU,Budget Workshop #2 6.9.22 (2),,60.0,3601.0,2022-06-10T12:57:22Z,none,80,0,0,0,thank you um [Music] and i think nick's four claws um just to let everybody know i want to thank you for coming this afternoon uh we are i guess you may say our second budget presentation and i just would like to let everybody know this is a modern debate uh where as the council is going to listen to uh anything that the department has have to say and if any questions we'll have we'll ask some questions and at this time i didn't know we're not moving to tony's uh prayer it's not a councilman it's just that budget hence violations will move on uh town manager's administration yeah so uh i moved myself up from number seven from the last time to this one cheryl's husband i just can't get out of the hospital so she's not here so i won't answer questions for capital if you have any questions on the uh danielson festival so number seven tab um [Applause] concerning the festival so foreign we wanted no no sure i wanted to okay so let's move on to admin expense so the first page of the admin expense budget at the top is town office i just want to verify this with tesla to make below that for the clerk's office with elections and general assistance and then code enforcement and assessing and then we flip the page tax collector building maintenance and repair for a total town office and then below that we have to add on community development and marketing and economic development and that gives us the total of 668-344 for the tennis administration at the very bottom of the second page concerning any of the entities that make up admin which would be the town office the clerk's office for election and general assistance code enforcement assessing tax planners community development and marketing and economic development are all part of ideal expense could you explain the large increase in town office i know obviously some of it obvious to us but ninety thousand dollars there's different yeah we saw a significant increase in health insurance and benefits as well as salaries we have a new full-time staff person so that we are able to stay open 7 30 to 4 30 and it helped cover any locations sicknesses so we don't have to close the office anymore sometimes you'd have to close it for a full day not just for the lunch hour and that's how we remedied that um the other significant increase but you'll see will be on social security and retirement there's three health insurance social security and retirement all part of the benefits so when i say diagnose that's what i mean it's all true thank you [Music] so if council doesn't mind um going to tab 10 which is your consolidated expenses and before we get started with the rest of the departments i think it's important to understand that our municipal revenue that we are receiving that we get more than covers and now that we have some new numbers again um this is what we talked about before as numbers come in we'll change and update for you it more than covers our expenses by over 500 000 so our overlay for the municipal side all of our departments all six departments that budget is more than covered by over 500 000 so keep that in mind when you are asking your questions of us today and the department heads um and when you look at the consolidated expense when you see that final line at the very bottom for the excess deficit um when you see that what you're looking at is the additional cost to the taxpayers and i'm very transparent about that when i present that i'm not just presenting to you the budget as if it's the municipal budget the municipal tax side of things which i think it's important to understand that there is a significant difference between when you get your tax bill and your mill rate and what the cost of each one of those sections goes into so for this particular year for the mill rate of 19.5 that council chose the the portion of your tax bill for the municipal side of that budget was only 33.55 um you're going to see that even a lot less and in this next fiscal year i don't have that exact number yet because we don't have the final numbers but our portion of the 19.5 for a tax bill was only 6.54 mills for this fiscal year and if if we move forward with this budget that's going to be even significantly less than that so there's been discussion about um coming back and asking us to cut the tech of the budget by 2 million and when you do that you are asking us to cut from the municipal services side um keep that in mind when we have these conversations because right now as it stands again everything that my department has asked for from you are covered by our municipal revenues the excess the deficit that you are seeing comes from the tax bill from the school and the count of tax so just keep that in mind before we move on to the next with code enforcement and tax assessor and community and economics thank you so court enforcement first tab one for counseling so [Applause] so it really has not if changed would like me to point out why there was a change two years ago when we were conducting the middle of the revaluation we eliminated what was called the quarterly review for one year because rebound was going on we're going to have to look at those numbers that was 7 500 a year i had budget 9 300 for about 10 years for that line item we reduced it to 2300 to care incident incidental expenses in my my certifications in the monthly reporting service on these under that same line for one year 2300. last year um the gentleman that had been doing our quarterly reviews retired and the only way that we could replace them was with the rebound company which we wanted to utilize anyway to do the reviews and the pickups and the repairs to anything that was considered wrong so he quoted me a price of ten thousand dollars and that's what he charged me it's the same this year i budgeted that all other all my three other lines are the same that they've been for a long time and on the revenue side if we look at the revenue side i don't know if it's available to them or not easily i have several line items that i'm responsible for some that i have no control over if it's going up do you have it on their unconsolidated income the first subtotal and i've tried to reflect as a three-year average in my revenue side in anticipation of where it's going we had budgeted four thousand dollars this year because of unforeseen investments in fort fairfield and the fees that we charge those people i'm going to be closer to i feel very comfortable in budgeting five that i'll reach that with all my other fees even if we don't have any large investments and then the pilots all of those the portfolio authority fields blame it is a formula process uh ts9 deals portfolio volumetric people and one and three and the little transformer do one is strictly a reflection of the money that they make we give the percentage of what they collect net aws that's a new budget figure that's a new negotiated figure we had had ten thousand dollars budgeted for about 20 years and that's the new wine item increase and the reason is it was renegotiated by the town manager of the council rewarding view is strictly middleweight it's pretty forward the reason it went down a little bit is because it's suggested by the millions value times the mill rate in the rule of taxes it used to be a formula one and a left a little bit every year until they get to the saturation point where they couldn't provide that amount of increase in their revenue alliance side of the page on the other side of the page is tree growth reimbursements and that's a direct reflection if you see numbers there it's a three-year estimate and the changes are reflected in what we are able to reimburse for the exemptions that we allow in this community pre-growth reimbursement is a shelter it's a value less than the market value and because the state makes us make that program available the hearing versus a formula from it whatever number of acres we have to win they multiply by our mill rate and multiply a couple of other factors we need a percentage of it same thing with the veterans exemption reimbursement you have about 126 veterans i believe still surviving fair field at different levels of participation and things depending on what style of veterans exemption they qualify for we get the percentage different depending on what kind it is homestead exemption is as long as we're at 100 percent it's 100 reimbursement it's 100 review in a formula that should give us 73 this year if we were any less than 100 we would have to discount the homestead exemptions for everybody that's given homestead exemption for the state to claw back for difference because we didn't collect enough money and that's the reason that justified the rebound in the last few years betty reimbursement's the same thing as the reflection of what we are able to use as an exemption for business personal property for all almost all business personal property has been purchased in recent years except for retail doesn't qualify for retail and doesn't qualify for office machinery and that's just a formula thing the state pays us back fifty percent but we would have gotten had we taxed it that's all the line items that i'm responsible for thank you so just a year or so before i was hired as director in december of 2014 council had discussed closing the library in the years leading up to that point the library has seen drastic reductions to its budget and cuts in staffing just one example was our book budget which is dropped from 14 110 in 1992 to currently six thousand dollars numerous studies have proven that cuts to funding and our staffing leads to snowball effect of less use of a library in my first three years as director the library saw a 70 percent increase in use due majorly in part by the building up of the jesse drew archives and in programming that we were able to fund through the few grants we were eligible for in the fiscal year 1819 budget council recognized this amazing growth and allowed me to hire a part-time team to meet the increased demands in 2019 we started to reap the rewards of having a dedicated programming aide who could not only plan but also seek out more free programming opportunities and grants giving us an even greater return on investment we worked with the school to supplement many of their curriculums demand and use continue to grow as word got out about what we were doing we were literally heralded by the state librarian in augusta to the maine state legislature as an example of what funding can do for communities in early 2020 through an unforeseen event we lost our programming aid the library utilized this opportunity this temporary opportunity to try to help protect the town's resources during the scary early times of proven and chose to not immediately retire in june of 2020 we didn't ask for the funding and in 2021 to again help the town resources get through coven if that scary time has passed the library needs to get along with its mission to provide services and programming by reinstating the programming aid position services that are repeatedly asked for on a weekly basis because they are wanted now more than ever by parents by the teachers by senior citizens and by these kids a study by the maine state library showed that librarians are the second most trusted professionals out of the 22 professions study rating higher than doctors and only second to nurses when a person needs to know something they go to their library a similar study by pew research showed that in homes with annual incomes below 30 000 49 get help from the library 31 use our computers or internet access 38 use the library to research health information 65 maintain that libraries contribute to helping people decide what information they can trust it also found three of the top four requests of library functions is programming eighty-five percent of all americans that we're surveying feel that library that a library should definitely offer literacy programs for young children 78 say libraries should definitely provide digital tools and programs for learning to use computers smartphones and apps and 76 percent want libraries to provide programs about privacy protection and online security 75 say libraries have been effective at helping people learn how to use new technologies it's been suggested that we utilize volunteers and that we share employees between departments during downtime a library doesn't have down time ever we have approximately two thousand people that walk into the door in through our door each year that represents over 55 percent of our town's population when we have programming that percentage jumps to 73 this number only represents those that walk in the door and doesn't include the number of reference phone calls for information or website and email requests that we also receive daily when we aren't helping those that walk in the door we're archiving cataloging and processing books researching grants researching reference requests and much more we are constantly performing housekeeping on the physical collection for accuracy and relevance we are planning for future events programs and services and if that's not enough we have enough scanning transcription and archival work to keep twice the number of staff busy for the next seven to ten years assisting people with the massively varied requests and personalities that we deal with each day requires training lots of training in just the past three days we've helped a senior citizen will tweet a jazz recording on the internet and rescued 193 videos off of a 2009 camcorder for a woman that thought that she had lost all of the videos of her children growing up and we helped 41 other people with their buried requests in just three days you have to be ready to go from working with a senior citizen navigating a computer one second to assisting a social worker distracted four-year-old with emotional needs throwing a temper tantrum in the next and still be able to unclog a toilet in the afternoon i've done all these three things this week physicians in our department require six months to a year of on-the-job training to be minimally effective in their job duties i myself even after eight years still do at least 30 to 50 hours of training each year to keep up with the advances in technology social issues and safety a few weeks ago i had the pleasure of meeting one of the most amazing people i've ever had the chance to meet a native american war veteran who was born the same year as my father he was at least a veteran of the korean war and possibly like my father of world war ii he needed to go to canada to check his mail but he hadn't been able to collect in almost two years he had never used a computer in his life we spent an hour getting everything he needed including helping him to search his vehicle for his lost identification documents and explaining the process so he was comfortable going through the border we needed to set up an email address for him create the can arise account the entire process took over an hour and a half before he was on his way in that time we had to ask many required questions name address birth date full identification numbers where he was going and more since the border east restrictions in march we have done this over 80 times for other people other people tell us about their health issues so we can help them find information to research they see us when they need to email job applications or legal documents they trust us to help them with bank issues and with possible scams these people we help have to trust us with their most safely guarded possessions their identities and it all needs to be done with compassion and patience we need trusted team members that are willing to put in the effort and time needed to effectively work with our community members and perform their job functions keeping patron privacy and safety foremost in their minds at all time the only line items with increases other than the reinstatement of our programming aid are driven completely by things that are out of our control the fuel and the minimum wage increases at this point i don't know what more i can do to to ask you for to continue to support this library and reinstate my programming it's it's not important for this library to get this back up in monday again is there any questions that freeze up your age and that's the only increase that i'm asking for other than the fuel which i can't control and minimum wage because all of my all of my staff is minimum wage so that's driven by the state i can't control that i can't lower that and right now i'm we're down to two people myself and another part-time aide i have to replace another one that i also just had to leave mean when we're again it's like the town office if one of us is out we have to close the library because it's not safe it's not safe and it's not there's a person that's left behind to have to handle everything we had 19 people in the library today 19 we added five new library cards patrons this week we're growing quickly there's new people moving in here and we are burning quickly and i need the staff because we can't keep up any questions on the line items in front of council i guess just going forward before we move on since you're like one of the first ones i just want to see like kind of listening recommendations on what should be going on with this budget like so if we're going to try to find a way to get the numbers down like for each department should we be looking at things that we can recommend to them while they're here so they can go and make these changes so that they can re-present to us before we vote so i think we should look at that with every single department if we're going to make any movement in any direction yeah the biggest thing in every department that not only we are in our community everybody else is the number of effects of expenses that we have no control over and that's changing as we speak we're faced with changes in prices daily where do you come up with an accurate number and a percentage sometimes to think of it is one thing to say it kind of scares you but we're we're all faced with with a change in our economics out there that is is a number but uh look at that number today that changes so dramatically tomorrow and i think for the most part if if you look at you know like your department of what you just said tony's or any department head that's that's looking if you look at last year's budget it's pretty much the same you're just rolling the expenses that we're faced with and you know i i we said here trying to make the right call and what you know it's almost scary to think of the number because you know what is where's it where's where's it gonna end you know we see gastric today it's five dollars a gallon diesel seven bucks a gallon is it gonna go there diesel 10 bucks a gallon and gas eight dollars a gallon look at your electric bill when's that going to stop we could be faced with a 30 increase just in daily usage that keeps us going and there's nothing we can do about it it's almost scary but i i um at this point uh you just try to look and say well what if and what if and where where we can you know make some changes to prepare ourselves for that expenses um and that's that's that's an answer that i don't think any of us has got right now on a projection um so my recommendation as terrible as it sounds is to not hire the aid at this time and to lower your reserves to fifty thousand that's just a recommendation council has to vote on all that just trying to find someone the room somewhere and that would be my recommendation to go i think sometimes i'm supposed to be put from the slate group to muslim yes that's going to have to be required i think we're working with the library board on getting some um different types of funding the budget council had some recommendations on that are we working on well they need to reinstate their 501c3 okay so there's people who are not sitting down for that lawyer yeah one to three months is what they're saying and it's important for the council to remember with the 501c3 it's not the library that's the title 163 it's the board of trustees because if the library was the 501c3 they would not be a municipal function and i would have already applied for the grants right yeah it's not it was not it's completely out of their hands it's up to and they were working on it before coded hit and then when everything got shut down the lawyer wasn't seeing anybody that lawyer is now too busy so they had to get a different lawyer um and he has filed he says it's now one to three months so they have fire for their five hours and [Music] on the um [Music] so is [Applause] um out for you guys to just cruise at your leisure um good afternoon councils uh i'd like to start by saying um we've sat and watched as your budget advisory committee decided whether to approach you with a request for a budget that means a 22 or a 25 milligram as the discussion carried on and some folks were trying to grasp an understanding of the conversation mr bouchard on camera stated let's tell them we want to meet at 22 millery even though we would accept the 25 mr brown in sorts questionably repeated we would accept 25 milligrams and mr bouchard said but we don't tell them that the committee grabbed the number out of the hat and ran with us at the same meeting mr mcgillin stated something to the effect of you can cut 100 000 from the rec department budget right off no explanation as to why where the budget costs will be cut or consideration to which employees or programs will be lost if that happens again pulling a number out of a hat we sat at the council meeting where your budget committee handed in their recommendation ms powers and mr bouchard had a lengthy conversation regarding the numbers your committee submitted and how the formula to reach their millery calculation was inaccurate leading to wrong numbers and misinformation we then had two counsellors even after that notice that the budget budget advisory committee's information was incorrect wanted to have budgets redone to meet this inaccurate and misleading number we have also heard many times during the last budget cycle and now this one regarding concerns of transparency i have had countless sleepless nights trying to figure out why people feel that transparency is now an issue we have been nothing but open and honest about our budgets about the services we provide about the needs of our community then it hit me the light bulb went off and i realized we truly weren't being totally transparent we like mother hens were shielding our community from the truth so it's time to be transparent mr bouchard mentioned during one of the budget committee meetings that folks didn't complain in the past because things were good the unfortunate part is while you were all assuming things were good you had past counselors past town managers past apartment heads doing things illegally and dangerously in an effort to save money when things were good you had a town willing to have an employee come into work 30 minutes early and not pay them for years former department heads and managers had a town employee come into work 30 minutes early to open up the gym at 6 00 am and he was never paid for his time please want to understand what i have just said for years this town made an employee coming to work 30 minutes earlier than his normal shift every day to allow our recreation program to happen and take place and the town never paid him for his time that is illegal fortunately the former manager and director of our public works discover what was happening put into it and made amends with the employee however it did in the long run cost director hanson and had fun compensating that employees for his time in the middle of a budget cycle which he did not have accounted for but things were good because it didn't cost the taxpayer anything when things were good when i first started i questioned the former rec director about the liability of having the gym open while staff were not present in the building he said and i quote i know there's an issue there but i haven't looked into it because i know it's going to cost the town money the program allowed items to be damaged in our gym allow items to be stolen from the building and put our community in a dangerous position in regards to the liability and negligence lawsuits but things were good because it didn't cost the taxpayer anything when things were good we had a 25 year lease from our school from our own recreation recreation field along with a building for storage concessions and restroom this lease was not renewed as the school officials have stated the building was not being maintained and we needed to take care of it before we lost it like many things in our department the pool the old ice rink the old warming hunt community center the rec ball fields our playgrounds our parks and tennis courts little to no preventative maintenance was done and little to no money was ever put away for the purpose of maintaining or repairing or replacing our recreational infrastructure but things were good because it didn't cost the taxpayer anything caveat to that um last year i had a six thousand dollar pool pump that i had to replace in the spring which was the end of our budget cycle i don't know how you expect us to fund that if you do not fund our reserve accounts the only other option would be to fund it in the following year and don't open the pool i recently received the best second-hand compliment oh sorry missed one we've heard this mcgill in state in support of our own recommendation of lowering our recreation department budget by a hundred thousand dollars tom always made it work the before mentioned examples of intentional disregard for law and safety and i can certainly give more are how this town made things work their example of how our town and whole former councils former managers former department heads made things work by intentionally looking the other way in regards to law the safety of our community and the future of our community by intentionally hiding the true cost of what it costs to run our department i recently received the best second hand compliment ever gene cronin the recreation director in presque isle was recently discussing our departments with some of his friends they were discussing our programming our budget and our minimal staff side note the prescott recreation department has 50 paid staff in the summertime he stated i don't know how kevin does it in 2019 we had 18 staff members throughout the entire year some of them were seasonal assistants that could only work six hours a week on weekends others were seasonal coaches specific to a sport this year we plan on only having 15 staff members if all works out we have consistently been doing more with less staff and have been able to provide outstanding programs and services for our community how we do it is by making it work we are passionate about our jobs and we are passionate about our community it is unfortunate but we are running to now is decades of deceit misinformation and dangerous practices being corrected because of this the true costs of our community are being shown it isn't that we are being deceitful we have just removed the smoke screen and you are now able to see clearly just as unfortunate by simply making it work we are not planning and preparing our community for the future we heard mr brown question on a budget committee meeting in regards to the library's request for funding uh their roof replacement project why doesn't she ask for 25 000 per year instead of 150 000 at once the answer is because we are at the point where our requests for reserve account fundings for projects like these have been denied for so long that you may lose the library and its contents the problem is the same for all of our departments this is the failure of some past department heads for not asking for funding and planning for maintaining our infrastructure the failure of past management for not taking charge and making sure department heads were planning for the future of departments and our community and the failure of past councils for deciding that these requests presented were not worth funding our reserve accounts give us the ability to plan for the future period we have also heard over the past couple years everyone's favorite excuse to cut funding i see a lot of wants on this list at this point the difference between a want and a need is semantics what is a one for one person is a need for someone else there is no point argument what is proven to be a universal truth however is that when you prepare for it it ends up when you do not prepare for it it ends up costing you more in the end whether it costs more to fix something because you do not prepare the cost prepare and the cost of materials went up or is because you choose not to invest your time and money into the project and service and then you lose the asset or the service i will let you decide what is worth as we sit here now four months into our budget process we are again starting from scratch we are presenting the same budgets we did in march we are explaining line by line item by item the exact same way we did in march by watching the budget committee meetings it is clear to see that some of you apparently have questions instead of coming directly to us which you have had multiple opportunities to do because we as staff have been present for every public budget hearing and council meetings since this product started some of you decided it would be best to pose your questions to a budget committee as deputy fenderson once stated if i have a problem with my automobile i'm not going to call a dentist we came up with our budgets please feel free to ask anything about our budgets that's why we're here lastly please understand that all of our budgets are wants needs hopes and dreams wrapped into one i want to offer quality service and programming to my community i want to be able to offer programs that service the currently underserved portions of our community adults elderly and preschool kids i want to be able to maintain our recreational infrastructure so folks can have it for years to come thankfully my once aligned with the needs of our community none of our budgets have frivolous requests in them if you request a cut from any of our budgets there will be a loss in services adding to that i received an email today um uh just letting you guys know since uh you guys will like eventually hear it again because you will need to approve it congratulations this is from eve battal from the spe foundation you have been awarded a 3d printer for your programs and to be used for supporting community and for school activities um so the 3d printer award that we went for we received which is i believe a 3 000 value so that printer is to be used for uh specific purposes in aligning with our application the first program it's going to be used for is our summer program which we will have regardless of whether we have a printer or not we have a rocket cam which sd's rockets has rockets or you can 3d print parts so our first integration with this was to add it to that the second part of that which is the other reason why they gave us the brand is because they wanted to integrate it with the school so we plan on offering a high school program where we integrate the 3d printer as well as integrate a springtime field trip bringing those participants down to umo college of engineering which we have a relationship with to view the world's largest 3d printer in their program so please understand that that is built into this budget if you don't want this or if you choose if you don't want this then i'll have to tell them because that can be cut from the bucket um so i'm going to spare you i guess the going through line by line because you guys have had four months to look over so are there any questions regarding uh the wrecked full-time staff blinds i'd like you to explain oh absolutely solely sure i sure can so uh over the past four years we have been slowly building up our budget to be where it should be correcting wrongs correcting illegal activity correcting dangerous activity and putting ourselves into a position where we are meeting fully the needs of our community so with that uh it became apparent that it was difficult to find at times and most times difficult to find volunteers for programs the best examples that i can give are last year for our minor league program our firemen baseball had 19 participants in our program and zero parents willing to volunteer to do anything so we had to take it over the other one would be the first time we did tiny talks soccer i had 20 excuse me i had 12 registers when we first started the program the day by 4 30 to 5 o'clock before the first time started i had 36 kids registered and zero parents going to help so if we want the programs we have to have the staff so with that our pool director is not coming back this year so this person is going to be the assistant pool director or should be the pool director and the assistant right director helping out with programs around any questions or any questions on the summer wreck staff i will let you know that in the summer rec staff piece the only thing that is different from last year is obviously because of the minimum wage and the the annual increase for the employees the wages did go up however the summer gym supervisor which is five thousand three hundred fifty-five dollars uh was a position we did not have um however it was a piece that has been missing from our community uh and a piece that has been asked for by many community members so the concern from some people that i guess i have heard is that they're going to have an employee sitting there just watching waiting until something happens and that that is not the intent the intent is for from four to six pm to have an organized activity uh with that person um and then from six to eight pm it's a gym supervisor so you have open gym from 6 to 8 pm the good news with that is from 4 to 8 pm anybody can come in and use um adjusting wages so the pool staff um there are two things that have changed with that uh we did increase the hours in 2019 we did 2244 hours 2021 we had 2480 hours we did bump that up slightly to 2500 even this year because we plan on trying to see if we can increase the revenue by offering um either we have to decide whether it should be saturday or sunday but offering a rent rental for birthday parties uh in the mornings when we're not available or when we're not open for a general swim if it works it works if it doesn't it well as the need the need to increase the pay above minimum wage so we increase the pay for a starting lifeguard 50 cents above minimum wage and if they get their wsi certification 50 cents an hour which will help us immensely um so the total for that is that 35 125 from a pool and then the last part of the wages would be just various program assistance throughout the rest of the year and that would be where your uh so for example um this past past fall and winter we had uh a young lady who um because she was uh into sports and she was working in the sports at school she could only work the weekend so she was our our summer or actually our weekend open gym person and then we had help with various staff helping out with programs during the week any questions how hard would it be for you to come up with the total hours of all your summer staff uh so i've got right here um colvin and cameron the great man which are my two summer staff 560 hours per week that's 14 weeks working at 40 hours oh i can photocopy this for you it's all right here okay so yeah yes i get a photocopier right there thank you you're welcome um well i appreciate that thank you four or five uh i told you six or seven yeah uh administration do you have any questions on the administration education and training that for them yes it's because we have uh only four rickering yards so it's mostly guards but it's also because our um our pooled record we needed to get him certified but we're also looking to get him certified to certify life credits so that way because one of the things that we've run into is and it happened last year and it's happening again this year is we can only go to gentile hall for for training and the last time that she does training is in the middle of june and on occasion sometimes uh like last year he could have used a training at the end of the day just to get extra staff so by this though we can offer it any time [Music] no he would be he well we could we could do anything but specifically his would be the lifeguard certification to teach people to be lifeguards so that that for that includes for that it includes their their cpr and first aid but to get just a general first aid and cpr you have to look at something else that that would be the other thing is it'd be a cost savings because we could just do it ourselves instead of having to pay 225 a piece to get it done which is actually less than it has been because they decided this year to leave the 50 per person non-resident normal uh that increase yeah no that increase because we are now paying a 250 um fee per year which will be paid in january to utilize the nordicare exam as a rec department which that 250 feed so for example uh if we brought our rec department out um which we had multiple programs that have done there we use disc golf mountain biking hiking we also do with adult mountain biking this year but anybody that participates in that per person's feet or we have to add that down to the fifa program but by doing this it allows us to just go and the people that are participating so again this is not a question that i want to ask but i'm just curious what the answer is um if our rec department were to charge a fee for people to participate in all activities a set fee or based off of income or something like that how much income would it actually generate roughly anything so i will let you know that to this point um we have generated i believe six through three just through just the fees that we have um we have generated six thousand dollars in revenue for the year which isn't substantial for the overall budget however it's more than ever brought in before so if we were to start charging for every single program i think the the fees brought in [Music] would definitely increase however i don't believe you would be looking at a substantial increase because i think part of the problem is like right now um because of our programming that we offer we have brought in um more non-resident fees than ever before right for our pool for our rocket camp for every camp that we offer even our basketball and soccer so we charge our own resolution so we brought in more non-resident fees than ever before um but if we were to start charging our local children for the fees i think the problem that you're going to run into is um i believe it's gone down substantially uh as far as the number of children and i can find that information up for you but in 2019 when i applied for the disc golf grant we were at 72 of our school kids which is around 550 kids qualify for a federal fee reduced lunch so they're considered low income i believe that number's going down but i don't think it's going to succeed so i don't believe your income number your revenue income will be increased substantial i believe what will happen is it might increase some but your numbers for participants are going to drop for local for a teacher so there was a there was a little bit of a push back from a small group of people regarding uh us charging a fog dollar fee for a local swim pass but if they would have read if they would i guess if they would have read the entire thing all the way through it's not,True

UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,PLN3o3-3EtE,Budget Workshop #2 6.9.22 (4),,55.0,3323.0,2022-06-10T12:33:54Z,none,31,0,0,0,job for basically nothing so what happened was that we still do a little we didn't stop all together what happened was that work really slowed down when they found out that you didn't want you know supplementary so that's really what has happened there and like i said it's really sad that that was a that was part of a budget committee discussion instead of somebody coming and saying hey why aren't we really we just really needed to put a real cost to it to where the taxpayers were being burdened with somebody else's costs i really don't have it uh much more than that but i would love to answer any questions on anything that you have tell me what the central purchasing is so that that's the supplies really for the whole town down to philippines paper towels cleaning supplies provide the ability maintenance and groundskeeper so we're the ones that have we bring in the supplies for each and everything that's part of that i have no you know going over it the first time presentations everything is uh um we had several discussions on how we're going to move forward with the public works department and the way that it's stacked year-round to help create a better safer working environment for our public works crew creating actual time off for staff in the winter time because clearly every weekend it's most unfortunate um and we're seeing you know rain when we needed to be nice days so that we can get work so darren um and i have discussed four ten hour days and split work weeks which means everything is still covered as normal the the community will see no difference but we will see a rise in um job satisfaction with our staff which is integral considering we've lost so many staff understand we're not talking about increasing the number of staff members we're just gonna what's happening is because of climate change we're seeing more events that are typically smaller last year i don't think anybody saw a snowstorm that was really over seven or eight inches right so if we do that we can cover seven days a week ten hours a day it doesn't mean that there won't be a call out where you have to bring the rest of your crew in to work with the with the crew to make a complete crew myself and the deputy director will also split our time we will work one monday through thursday one tuesday through friday and then we will each cover a day on the on the weekend with the euv i i am willing to bet that we will have a better level of service we may even save on some overtime uh and we will be able to give our employees 60 to 70 percent of a three-day weekend throughout the winter good i i'm i'm really excited it's much safer for them this is for the winter months because we've been doing 10 hour shifts from winter winter months only and then we would go back to a consolidated crew that everybody worked monday through thursday yeah on during summer yesterday sorry which is almost the winter time which is yesterday yes well your little drifting events where before we we really would try to hold off because the crew had worked so many hours for the through the week now you'll have a crew there they're there ten hours a day on the weekend they'll be able to cover those those issues you know they'll be a little slower getting around but they'll be there they'll be able to take care of that i'm excited about coming what's the problem we've got to do something what we're doing is not sustaining suggestions questions so i guess i would say look at your numbers and see where you can try to eliminate about thirty thousand i can dollars that right now and sadly that would be in paving reserves okay the problem with that is if you want to get on a 10-year paving cycle which is really what we should be on right now we need somewhere between eight hundred thousand and fifteen years a year so i we're getting calls daily about paving their road it's not a reality right at the moment the only other thing that i can recommend that mrs powers and i have talked about this and it's an investment once again is that someday we need to hire a real grant writer somebody that knows the nuances of i mean that there are some crazy ins and outs and there may be money out there that unfortunately they weren't missing that that is the only other possibility to get us back where we need to be and there are no guarantees with that that's just i want something to think i wonder if chain language is still around he is he is i don't think we want to hide everybody i am that's the only other recommendation i have like i said if we had to immediately if we had to cut that's where i would cut and that would be unfortunate yeah because we should be increasing that i still have to remain for that road you did i was on the my great side you know yeah i travel a lot once a week or twice a week and i agree every time i go over that honestly i'd like to be able to do three or four miles without a year because there's nothing we enjoy uh tell you if only some people knew what it was and what you brought it and it held up well over the winter yes it did sadly from here on out to that road though it's all downhill yeah because from the day you do it the other way but if you'll get it you'll get probably six years ago yes thank you thank you before we proceed looking at all of these things and all these recommendations for cuts and things like that obviously again a drop in the bucket it's hardly going to make very much difference it won't even shift the number it's not even that significant enough to shift with the amounts that i recommended if we were to take seven dollars what's the difference between if you have to come from admin and maybe potato blossom festival um it only puts us at 250 000 so i don't know if that makes any difference at all but it makes a big difference for the departments that's the hard part that is correct it has a significant effect on their ability to provide but it does not have a significant effect on the which again you will not know what that means until october so i guess i would just ask if maybe you could show a comparison of what it would look like if that was cut what it would look like absolutely um i would just like to touch on one thing that was said at the budget advisory committee meeting on tuesday not by the budget advising committee but it was entertained by a budget advisory committee from a citizen stating that values were going up 50 and their taxes were going up 59 i do not know where those numbers come from and when questioned by a budget advisory committee member if you haven't seen it yet please watch it um their response was well i don't know maybe that's the danger in having people who are they have their own self-serving agendas because they're sharing information that is incorrect and it is inciting people to believe and think things about town staff myself council that is untrue if you really look at in the history from fiscal year 1718 to fiscal year proposed budget of 22-23 from last year's budget to this year's budget for grand total it's only a 20.05 and that's not even inflation we don't even hit the 30 so we we are doing the best that we can with what we have but i can tell you um we don't have as much in revenues this year as we did last year which is hurting us we've got a 4.75 loss in in revenue um and these are you know and that's with the capital reserves the capital plan if you fund those that's still only a 20.05 increase from last year to this year we are nowhere near the the actual equation so we are scraping and finding ways to make pets and do these things moving forward and again we're about to look at you know other expenses and unclassifieds and those types of things and it's important to note that making small changes here and there you know is really insignificant for what was asked at tuesday's budget advisory committee by some citizens that were in the audience it was a significant cut that they were asking for and please be aware it wasn't the budget advisory committee that asked that it was a citizen who made those suggestions and more than one if you go back and watch it you'll see um and it comes from they don't want to pay that in their taxes that that's what you hear i don't want to pay them my taxes sure just like limestone doesn't want to pay us to provide an ambulance service for them or anything like that if you want the service it costs the money to provide it and we are telling you bottom line bare minimum this is what it costs to provide those and i will share with you here also um you know heating oil and coal has gone up um but we are looking at ways to save money doing that throughout next winter um and we may not be able to properly project or budget for heating oil costs um utility costs again um significant changes coming so those are things that we need to be aware of moving forward that even though we're making these projections now in june for what's going to happen all of next year to next june we may be faced with the same situations that we are today and we have to learn how to figure out how to get through those things but if we don't properly budget for the bare minimum then we may be in an even worse situation next year so on the um other expenses for the heating oil and coal we've combined those two together utilities building repairs and then the bond payments this council have any questions on any one of those folders so and again even though we move on feel free to go back if you start to have questions insurance budget purposes um these are the the insurance for the town not insurance for staff that's not a benefit side this is the insurance for the town we have data compromise general expense bonding fleet vehicle general liability police insurance public officials real estate unemployment and your first call and you'll see the most significant increase in certain workers problems and then below that um what most communities call safety and sanitation budget it does not mean barbaric removal and police it's public fire street lighting street light repair and um unclassified which is all of our outside agencies and other costs so outside agencies that we give back to that provide the services for our citizens is a rustic agency on evening acap the arbor committee american red cross central linguistic chamber of commerce central acoustic soil and water community health and counseling services homeless services of a rooster life flight memorial day va those are the flags that we need senior citizens and united way so it's a very minimal it's only ten thousand eight hundred and ninety-six that the return on investment with these groups is um has all the questions on any of the outside agencies or any outside agencies that they feel are not drug redundant other costs uh contingency and we had a very long discussion about this at the first and second public budget hearing we do not properly plan for contingency if every single employee needs the town of fort fairfield and we are supposed to be doing that so i will caution council again contingency is important um county tax again that's the number we were given maine municipal association meadows the 25 6. that's part of that that you looked at earlier uh with tony the northern maine uh nmdc northern development commission um sad 20 that number has changed that's not the the same number um because of the budget that went through it and we'll change that and update that for you and the budgetary state group insurance and then the tax anticipation of interest any questions okay so again reserve accounts if you remember back in 2019 um when i first spoke to council about preparing for the budget i brought it to council's attention that our reserve account is what traditionally fort fair code uses as their capital plan that's that's what they do you have to plan for the future of your community you have to somehow you cannot tell your citizens we do not care what happens we will not be funding anything moving forward it's state statute and i've quoted the state statute many times for council what council determines is the right thing to do is what council can do but you cannot say we absolutely will not do any capital planning whatsoever that's why in 2019 you did a very minimal amount for capital planning and you did not fully fund any of your reserve accounts however we did allow me to invest our general fund into ics accounts for each one of the reserve accounts for each department and we if we had not done that when the pandemic hit we would have been in a lot of trouble because that was our first attempt to get us out of the million-dollar tan at the beginning of the fiscal year six million dollar tan at the end of the fiscal year for cash flow that helped us significantly and then of course 2020 2021 budget very difficult to even get anybody to consider doing that again in light of all the turmoil a lot of the pandemic in light of everything that is happening so we are right back to where we started before the 2019-2020 budget we need to fund those reserve accounts with the general fund the treasurer and i have created a plan to make sure that that happens moving forward and we will be sharing and presenting with council so that you know that that's happening but it's it's important to remember cash flow you have to have that in order to pay your staff and pay your bills and if people do not pay us then that stops our cash flow from happening like the outstanding 400 over thousand dollars in tax bills that have not been paid um and if council wishes it is public information we can bring that to you so you can see that um we also have our money that has not been fully funded and is still being withheld from us and we have revenue sharing that is coming on the 16th yes 16th um and it's a minimal amount it's not significant at all so it's it's very important that we are when we are pulling back from the municipality and we are cutting budgets and we are not funding things properly um that will affect your cash flow as well um and we we have to be cognizant of that moving forward as well i would caution the council to be cognizant of that now that being said i will make sure that council has an updated general ledger summary report of the reserve accounts before you meet in june next week for the budget vote so you see where that's at and then i will show you the significant difference between funding and not funding what that will do because i think that's important that you see you know where we would be at if we did not do that um the capital improvement plan which has been requested by a forward request which is not necessary but again has been stated many times the capital improvement plan for the town of four figures was your reserve account that's what you do traditionally i have not changed that i've asked to change it the council has not been receptive to making those changes um if councilwood and might would like to see an actual that's going to cost money because that's what a capital improvement plan is you have to put money away for your capital improvement plan you have to design and create and fund these projects that will change and create growth for your community that's what you're supposed to be doing with that but if you're not going to do what we already do with the reserve accounts with your capital improvement plan having me set aside another program again like i did in 2019 2020 it's it's wasting my time because and i have a lot to do so um if you would like me to do that i'd be more than happy to do that but if you really don't want to see a significant change like we did in 2019-2020 i would ask you to think twice about me recreating that that system again because if we're not going to fund what we have now creating something more that needs to also be funded on top of that um seems irrelevant to me so does anybody have any more questions about older accounts so let's look at our consolidated income that's the new it should say six 8 to 20 22 at the top the one thing that i want to bring to your attention there's a new law that is in effect yes do you want to come on up real quick and explain that sure okay so uh in october of last year a new law went into effect and the state declared that disabled veterans 100 disabled veterans could get excise free um registrations on anything on well at first it was only on disabled veteran plates now they have moved it to any plate they wish to have they get no excise tax charged to them which then however yeah it's it's it's wonderful that you know the state is supporting our veterans however this allowed these specific people to go out and buy a brand new vehicle and then register it here and not pay excise on it so we lose out on thousands of dollars on excise tax so 1200 1765 2100 it's a lot it is so we we still feel good about the 656 for excise tax but it has the statement has been made that you know when you brought in 727 thousand dollars it should be what you brought in the year before but it's not going to but it's irresponsible of us to say that we will bring that in again knowing what we've already been seeing thus far with the changeover in the law so we feel very firmly on that 656. the same with the other ones the interest on taxes and means interest income checking investments snowmobile registrations re-registration fees vote excise miscellaneous general government and cable franchise fees um that that's given to us right because even though the state charges extra every year for these registrations we only get one dollar per registration for rewriters for new wedges we get two dollars that's it and that's across the board regardless of it's if it's new re-reg so there's really not a lot of room for increasing the projection of any of those top [Music] however um been incumbent upon the librarian to get grants for revenue because of revenue sources so um that is something that you know we've looked into what can we do how can we do this but without the increase in staff we really can't change that number we can't change the program and we can't change anything that we're doing so we're pretty much reticent to that fifty dollars uh code enforcement um tony has also uh mr levesque has already um shared with you how that works and why he's staying with the five thousand um certified copies hunting just like um the template just said uh dog license rare permits marriage licenses it's very insignificant it's not a large amount of income that we bring in for that local roads assistance that's the number that the state gives us uh fire and ambulance i hope to be able to see that number increase but i don't think that we will see a significant increase in that before because it's a new service that we're using for billing and we won't know what their numbers look like but if it looked like that for a service that really wasn't you know the service they said they would i'm very hopeful that we may see that significant increase for clockwork or final rescue which really needs for them so um pd miscellaneous that never really goes above that um the one time that you see if you look across from 1920 that was what we did with circles that year uh the payment in lieu of taxes those were already discussed things from the back threat department is we are a little over 6000 now so we predict the same for next year if we determine to change some things between now and june 15th we will let you know and we will show that in this line here moving forward but as of tonight that is what we predict for next year as well the potato blossom festival cheryl's pretty close to that already the 62 550 so um i think that will be this will be a very good year for her because it's a 75th she's getting a lot more sponsors than she normally would have a lot more vendors these types of things but i i don't see that continuing year after year from here i think we'll be going back down to around the 54 to 56 thereafter and then of course municipal revenue sharing hasn't just before we came here it was still set at 905 807 but again that could significantly change between june 15th and october 1st and we have seen that happen to us before bottom the tax required sales uncommitted taxes property taxes tree growth reimbursement veterans exemption reimbursement homestead exemption and betty reimbursement those are all numbers that we project right now but again once the numbers are finished once the reviews are done once everything comes in from the state we may see a difference in those numbers as well so i'm pretty confident on the six million four hundred seventy two thousand six hundred and five in revenue um they may actually be more um and it could possibly be a little less but i don't think it would be significant to that and by having that much of an overlay uh just for the municipal tax part because that will help in this area of the revenues not knowing what's coming from so that makes me very comfortable with those numbers any questions on the consolidated income okay consolidated expenses any questions for our total admin any review any new questions new suggestions new comments from the beginning okay [Music] library police department fire rescue public works festival again you'll notice her her budget is significantly less than our income this year and again we believe that's strictly due to being the 75th history recreation our community center safety and sanitation insurances contingency county tax maine municipal association northern maine development commission msa d20 state group insurance tax anticipation no interest tan interest the meadows reminder part of client program and then all of your reserves that total amount the 507 that includes every department so so the total municipal overlay and i'll i'll reiterate once again for those that don't understand um excess deficit is the same in municipal budgeting excess doesn't mean you have more it actually means you have less overlay is the term that they use for more and our municipal overlay strictly for the municipal side of the tax dollar is 512 861 our municipal expenses are 5 million 959 thousand seven hundred and forty four dollars which is significantly less than both the school msad twenties budget and the county's budget we have the smallest budget for three-fourths of the services provided i would like to say i have a magic wand and i can make that all go away as far as the excessive deficit is considered but i don't all we can do is prevent counsel with the facts and what we can do with the services that are being reflective of us to be provided for the citizens and the businesses and the people who come to this community i understand that this is a very tenuous topic and there's a lot miscommunication a lot of things being said that are untrue and i would always encourage people to come to me and ask me and i will give you the numbers always said that since i've been here and i do not mind sharing the numbers that's what i like to do so um if you are unsure if it does not sound correct always feel free to come to me and talk to you about it um i have quit at the very end and the council has anything more on the rest of what we've got so there's been and i will remind the council chair that i did plead with council to please not put this budget advisory committee together in the way that it was done i really felt like there was a better way to do it and it could have been a much more useful tool for all of us myself my department heads my staff the council included we have done in a way that made it um so that they were presented with what was expected of them um and not circumventing the town manager's office the ordinance literally circumvents my office and the charter states that i am responsible for the budget um i provide that information to council council approves it you give it back to me and it is my job to make sure that we do not go over the budget and by putting a committee together that absolutely circumvents my office it is very difficult for me to get information for them do anything for them because they have been told their their avenue is to council council directs me to give them the information which is completely backwards of the chain of command and the line of communications and the charter so i i would just like to share when when it was discussed the night that it was voted on the task before the budget advisory committee was to use the provided proposed budgetary information that council directed my office myself to give to them and for the committee to look through and discuss each department's proposed budget and look for any recommendations regarding the department's budget by line item and if you've watched any of the depart the budgetary budget advisory committee meetings you will see that that task has not happened because they didn't know they were given a situation where they were thrown in a room together and asked to provide information back to the council for advice on the budget that the proposed budget and i really believe that it had been done differently and with careful thought and consideration we may have saved ourselves a lot of this turmoil that is happening through the budget advisory committee meetings with citizens coming in and making statements that they probably shouldn't have been allowed to make some of these folks that are on the budgeted budget committee are not familiar with chain opinion and how these things work in municipal government um and so when you open up a town council town manager form of government to a town meeting style you are essentially and effectively changing how you do things in your municipality um i am here because i was promised that this is a chartered town council town manager form of government and i accepted that offer for this position because that's what i told you from what happened last year through the budget process and what is still continuing to happen through this year um that's that's not what we're doing and i would like us to go back to what we were doing because it works there's a reason why i prefer a town council town manager form of government because with town meeting you have a lot of interjection and you have a lot of opportunity for misinformation misguided information you can incite mob mentality very quickly an italian form of government um and i it may work for some communities but i don't see it working there because we have endured for a year and a half through this process not just myself and my staff but the council the citizens the business owners and i would really like us to get back to where we were before all of this happened january of last year so um i'm asking council to really think about what you expect the role of the budget advisory committee to be moving forward and its purpose and how they facilitate for me this is what i wanted to see and what i had asked for before it was voted on the primary purpose of the budget advisory committee is to provide judicious advice from a citizen perspective on the proposed budget to the town council which is our elected governing policy making body the town council is in control of the budgeting process and the budget advisory committee role is advisory it is an opportunity to facili facilitate citizens becoming familiar with the budgetary process of the municipality and to perform studies and evaluations of proposed municipal services upon the request of the town council like ordinance it's that simple i really feel like it's an opportunity for citizens to see what it is that we do that they do not know and to get through um what we do with the budget the budget is a major part of what the council and the town manager's office that's collected um once that has been given back to me and i hand that back to my department heads and let them know this is what we are doing moving forward and this is how we make it work this is how we change this is how we shift what we're doing um that is on us and we are responsible for those things um there's no personnel from the council and that is strictly by charter and i firmly believe in that because someone can be elected and put in that position simply to remove somebody from their seat from their appointed position and um i don't agree with that i will be very firm with counsel i think that is not serving the purpose of a council's position you should always be here for the better of the community on a whole not for a self-serving purpose um and same with having a citizen who does that on a daily basis too it's um it is exhaustive and it really creates an atmosphere of a volatile work environment for my staff so yeah that's where i would like to see us to moving forward um i'm i'm hopeful that with the information gathered here tonight re-information put back together give them back to the budget advisory committee giving back to council budget advisory committee has another meeting on tuesday before we have our council meeting on the 15th i'm hopeful that we'll have all of the notes from all of those meetings but they're all recorded so you can also watch those online and council can make a good solid decision on this fiscal year 22-23 budget will we hear from the budget advisory committee this evening there well this is for the department heads meeting this is not a budget advisory committee meeting we can schedule a special council meeting for the budget advisory committee if you would like but they were not um scheduled to be a part of this they were asked to be here too that they can see the process just like when we had them come to the public uh budget hearings um and helping them what they want to come to um but we have not scheduled that i just wasn't sure as far as us giving them guidance and what we're looking for you can because i have opened up the floor feel free to give them guidance right now because most of them okay and if i'd like to if they have any questions okay so i guess just my recommendation to the budget committee would be one i believe we need to change the way that you operate and so that you can go through the town manager's office that's on us i think we need to do that but i also think that as far as the budget advisory committee some of the stuff that was handed to you i think you need to really be careful of what information you're using and make sure that the information that you have made working off of is accurate because it doesn't work if it's not so that would be my recommendation the best way to find out obviously if that's accurate because if it comes from the town office i think that's going to be your most accurate information and i would strongly recommend that the budget advisory committee does not reach out to other communities or entities on behalf of the town because i don't think that's your place i think that your place is to review the budget and that you should stick to that task as a budget advisory committee i think that that's what we've been asked to do and if we focus more on that task at hand it kind of alleviates some of all that extra stuff so that we can just really look at the things that we need to look at that's just my recommendation mr chairman i would like to make a couple comments if it's possible yes i know if you go back to the hearing about the committee i was one of the members that opposed it they're one of the individuals and then i got my arms twisted to apply once it was approved to do so and i think we've assembled a good group diverse opinions i think i miss powers was correct we were given notebooks as you have but zero direction or instructions of what to do and i'd like to to your department heads if we said anything that upset you and i know there were some things but we had new direction we were more brainstorming of different ideas and things that might step on some phones but you know we're reaching to help our goal was to help i feel quite slighted that we have proposed a proposition to the count council and you know uh seems like a big waste of our time and frustration for your department heads listening to the discussion i think what we put together was reasonable but it's your decision and you decide but i'd like to see a vote on it i think we deserve that going forward you know i think most members would be willing to serve but we need direction and clear guidelines one of our discussions in our discussions we were talking about other municipalities and i think i made it clear in the meeting that we have no power meant to do so now if a council member in at the direction of the council wanted one or two of us to go to one of these meetings great but we we're not taking anything on ourselves to do so and you know so uh you know we were here to serve uh i think we gave it a pretty good shot in just the four weeks we had uh he had some good discussions and i think some discussions that could help but there again you know if what our work has done just nothing you know big waste of time i think that you guys got thrown into a very yeah and i understand that you had you know a short time to assemble this uh as far as off uh public addressing us uh the group as a whole the first night they had a discussion that they did want citizen input and you know i was a little reserved on that but i agree you know and we had it and but please give us credit to synthesize some of that and know where it's coming from and have the ability to analyze that and make reasonable decisions we're not being led around by the nose by anyone let's do my statement thank you thank you yeah i mean i mean this this whole thing has the potential uh like i said one of the town council meetings i apologize i made mistakes that's what makes us human in order to realize that a mistake has been made you you fix it and you you move on and and i knew there was going to be some mistakes i did um i think looking back we we should have met with the committee uh one-on-one uh prior to the budget getting closer maybe once a week to go over anything that you guys has come up which didn't happen um there again hindsight we but i learned from it i did i think with some adjustments i think we can move forward with this and make something of it i really do i appreciate the effort that you guys have put in i really do uh we're just trying to gather as much information as we can on both sides to make it work for our community uh if we didn't care we wouldn't put you where you're at i just i just feel yes there's a lot of tension there was last year and there is this year but we got to look at where we want our community at the best like buying insurance you want the best coverage for the lowest price you can pay and that's what everybody wants in our community they want the best service for the least amount you can pay but i think we're at a point that we can't do that because of inflation because of certain things we have no control over we can't jeopardize a good team that we have in any department so we're going to have to look at changing how we think to put towards each department to make it work and and you know it's it's it's been helpful uh having a committee like i said we've made some mistakes i've made some mistakes i'm not afraid to admit it i apologize to anybody i've seen that that might have offended in this moving forward but i i want to thank everybody for the efforts that you put in i want to thank all the department heads for sitting here again tonight and going over you know your budgets um you put a lot of work into it you put a lot of work into it our town manager uh working hand in hand with you people every day it's this is a four hour session but it took you weeks months to come up with this material a lot of long hours and late nights so i want to thank everybody for every input that you put in and every input you've changed um thank you and we'll we'll get through this we will um is,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,0Hepid8MmwE,Budget Workshop #2 6.9.22 (3),,60.0,3601.0,2022-06-10T12:31:58Z,none,43,0,0,0,need to come up with a number i just need direction so i it's a great idea but sometimes great ideas don't translate into working also just a reminder that was discussed back in 2019 early very early on with lifestyle haswell and mod to visualize services as well um limestone and caswell were the only ones who suggested that they would be remotely interested and put it has been um even during council meetings discussed with council uh the essence uh so i i've been trying to come up with additional sources of revenue because you know that's what you guys want right you want me to cost you less i'm trying to do better long distance transfers again we've talked about that numerous calls a day for transfers i just need guidance on what you want you want me to send the second ambulance if i have a crew to staff it if that means leaving only one ambulance in town you want me to hold off until if when whatever if we get a third ambulance and then i can still have twofer in town and send that one on a long distance the ball's in your court i need direction for what you want that's when i just don't want to sign our second analyst and nearly willie down down for out of town you already said that the calls have gone up quite a bit for the ems calls so i mean i don't i don't see why we want to find an amazon unless we get a few great if you were to get that other ambulance from prescott then yeah we could probably do something and get people to do some transfers because that's why we lost our anglo service because they can only make money on the transfer so but i for right now my my recommendation is to keep it the way it is and keep our two houses in town for for our residents to be clear what i have been doing to be transparent so don't be satisfied but not being transparent is i have been doing local transfers meeting in arusa county when i have staffing when i'm here available to respond to other calls so we do do some to try to supplement some but i'm very cautious about sending them out of reverse accounting for that very reason right because it's a long time you talk about transfers what is the real potential that you did 100 transfers it depends where you go and all that what's the actual amount of money you could actually earn from 120 birthdays it depends on so it depends on the distance and the level of care so we charge 13 a loaded mile so if you're going a thousand miles that's 13 11 mile plus your level of care i have the list the price list in my office but a a basic emt transfer is in the neighborhood of 400 on top of that mileage in advance als level 1 is in the neighborhood of 500 and a paramedic is around 800 specialty care 1200 again those are rough numbers don't quote me on those numbers but that's general idea on top of the loaded miles the load is miles is really why long distance transfers pay because when insurance companies you on transfers it's on the level of care not on the number of miles because it's easy to go on google and figure out how many miles from a hospital so they're going to pay you your miles it's the it's the level of care and it's set up now that if a transfer is being sent it's already been proven to be medically necessary so there's very little argument on the on the amount you're going to receive whereas ems calls it's always the argument well you charge for a paramedic they really need a paramedic all right let's look at their documentation how did they write their report is their report good enough to support that immediate paramedic or is there is a report tagging should have been amazing and that's that's how you get into a back and forth and that's why you have to have a billing company that does their due diligence because they if it gets declined they have to appeal it present the facts and they may need to do that three or four times before you can get money and then they'll want to discount the amount you get from what you build so whereas transfers more kind of set right because there's less arguable because it's medically necessary you're going from one place to another and the doctors are written for sprint so the the potential i can't tell you what the potential is i i can only tell you what i told you the other day which was at that point 74 or 72. i told you i encountered them then so how many we've turned down we've turned out more since then we've taken jim censor so we're doing what we can so even though we didn't or you had a slight chance of you wanted is there any vision of anything else out there that you could put together i need direction again if we're going to buy an ambulance that's going to cost money so that would increase this this budget so if you would like me to look at an ambulance that's in that twenty thousand dollar price range i can do that there's there's many many options then you have to staff it so yes um why don't you do a performa on the basic ideas that you have then you would probably know whether or not it would be profitable in the end so i haven't looked too much into this because the general consensus is we want to cut two million from our budget which is the fire department so again i'm more worried about keeping my staff uh doing what we're doing then i am trying to come up with numbers of things we might want to do if we decide not to cut the ambulance so you know if we're kind of in a consensus that we don't want to eliminate my department maybe that's something i can look into moving forward but i again this this is the first we've heard of it this is the first i've heard anything from you guys as far as a direction of what you want from me so i can't i'm more than happy to look into that uh the other option for additional billing is the fire billing which we have the importance proposal on again that's something we've never done here and again in the ordinance if you've had a chance to look at it that revenue would go back into our vehicle reserve to help supplement that again one of the questions asked the budget or maybe was the meeting where the um important interview proposed well does that mean we're going to ask for less in the reserve yeah about this year because we don't know if it's going to get approved we don't know if you guys are going to change it we don't know how much we're going to receive in the future will that maybe mean that i can ask for less in reserve every year possibly but i'm not going to say that by creating that ordinance i'm not going to ask for the same amount because we need to find based on what we know not on unknowns i do have high hopes that switching billing companies will help us with the ems billing that's been a large frustration for me um dealing with the lack of responsiveness from maine billing so comstar is the complete opposite and i'm very excited not to mention there we're gaining 1.5 but if there's any other questions you all have or direction or thoughts or comments i'd be happy to hear them discuss them i have a couple questions and i'm sure you have drawn over these i just want 148 332 um that is that is not going to change it is that is the tower truck and the ambulance okay that does not change even if you get rid of the department that's still commitment and the fire department build reserve for ten thousand that's the reserve for the community center that every department is asked to put we into have some recommendations i wanted you will see if you have your other copies is i've already removed what i was asking for um from fire equipment firefighting equipment tools replacing the reserve as well as fire department training reserve i had asked for them understand that's a small amount but i'm doing the best i can without crippling what we have going on again i want to highlight the major increases are paying staff you know they're they're at the front view now with being competitive and fuel prices and essentially the other things have been reduced because they're the same as what we've been asking for and there's 18 the inflation so effectively does anyone have any recommendations okay um so first i have recommendations on possible ways to generate income so i'm just gonna kind of write a list and i'll just go through it um the training that we're doing like the course that's coming up i think this this weekend maybe or whenever you guys are having because uh charging other communities to take that so we're we're not charging other communities i've submitted for the recent county fire chiefs to reimburse us the cost of the course so that we are refunded for any costs that we do deserve there's so the other communities provide their the books and the manuals for their students they provide the training the equipment needed for their students and they provide equipment for us so they'll be bringing their engines their tankers water it's working together there's no charge to them they're contributing by allowing us to use their equipment and some of the personnel to help us as well so it's just everyone kind of works together so everybody every command benefits from it um so i do think that we should pursue the ambulance from presque isle a little bit further and see what that number looks like that they would like to see because i'm sure they have a number we just need to know what it is maybe that's something miss powers i should help with and then i also think that we should look into the regeneration with other towns and consider doing it at a lower rate even a lower rate than we currently charge our citizens and the reason being is that it will open up that door and we will eventually be able to charge our citizens less so yes we're charging other communities less at this point but it's for the greater good of our community in the long run so that would be something that i would recommend pursuing a little bit more and i also think that we should use our second ambulance for transfers that's just my opinion that's not a council opinion i'm just saying that we're trying to cut costs and it comes at a price it's a crappy price and it's like you said it's a life or death price but it's something maybe we can look at locally at least to generate some income we already can if uh if i have a local transfer we take one so then maybe we expand to not necessarily locally and see what it looks like and if we do have a call when the first amendment is out then we do have to get assistance from other communities i mean that obviously we have to vote find something like that and look into it more but that so just like i think i'm not partners we have to have that third box before we start doing long distance transfers because i don't want you know i know what you're saying but we've got one amazon talent and we've got two levels there we want to i want to look out for the people of fort fairfield if we had the other arms and that's why when we started this whole program when we started this whole thing is that once we got the other engines paid off and we started getting more ambushes like that then we would then we would branch out to to transfers but coding them up with a with the thing with the ambulance and i think that's a great idea maybe we can look at that aspect of getting that third you know don't have to be the top of the line type type thing you know for transfers i think um and looking at that but but i don't want to give the transfer and we only get two answers and we have once we start paying i mean i just signed a check with a careful ammo service like well we're 500 for the trip over here i mean that 500 adds up every time right you know so i mean and we're in and we're going we're going through the part where i want to i'm working first now with that third ambulance that you know what they do and that's when we all start his homework and once we start getting getting the other extra instances then we can start doing transfers that's where the money is if we can finally come up with become an idea with a transfer site it something like cody was saying before and then use that vehicle there for transfers you know mostly uh for the transfers then we can use the other two animals in town and then after we get built up we can if we get another one because his money to the transfers and that's why we lost but possibly if one ambulance is out on a transfer could we not send if it was not a life or death situation so if we have an ems license and there's a 911 call we are required to send an ambulance we cannot have an ambulance we have to request mutually so a couple other things if we're talking about leaving the county for transfers that means one annual will be tied up for eight hours at least so that i know i know we think out of the county it's not that long but it's a minimum of eight hours and that's a bangalore transfer that's not a portland or a boston there's so many hours if we're doing a long distance transfer the other thing is that 500 we can only bill 382 for that 500 bill so every time we do that we're for sure losing money so again it's great that they're able to come and help us when they can and we go and help them when we're able to but that costs us money too so okay so then i guess i would just say then to continue with the local transfers with that second ambulance as much as you can i mean if it's going to generate revenue it would pay itself off in very little time to be clear if we did get an ambulance that was in the 20 000 range that would not go on transfers but that's asking for problems that that would sit here as a second agent that would be the second yes yeah i agree with that thank you i meant to say you picked something up because i mean we're talking we've talked about mars hills that you know we're in there and we started not a gear for this whole thing something like that a little don't get that they would use locally and they send another better answer down and that's i think that's a large reason why um central rooster doesn't do transfers their ambulances are all used and some of them from crown which crown was a big support for them getting going because they have the nursing home there and the nurses don't need dandruff so they they have a lot of used ambulances that are great for local you wouldn't want to send them on transfers so that's and then my other question is the 22.5 in the miscellaneous what was that i don't know it's actually 4 000 this year oh okay included our gear extractor so we moved it back down to 4 000 which is the amount that had been in the previous budget so i guess my recommendation for cutting anything again i'd say take 50 000 off of the fire truck replacement ten thousand off of the building reserve and five thousand off of the fire department equipment yes for a total of sixty five thousand anybody else have any recommendations thank you for the information [Applause] before you get started i'd like to commend all of you i want to commend you for thanking this police department for bringing up where you have such a short period of time thank you good evening um so the budget that i presented has really changed since the last i don't think it's changed it all since last meeting maybe i brought the fuel up a bit really comfortable with that number either with with the changes we're currently seeing this budget represents one police officer working 20 hours a day on call from home for four hours a day including the chief covering patrol and on call as well with the type of calls we've been going to one officer for a lot of these calls isn't sufficient and we have to rely on other agencies to assist us primarily lately on the u.s border patrol but they're also limited on what they can and can't do at our crime scenes or on our calls for service we have to send an officer to the police academy this coming year this coming fiscal year which is an expense to the town it has been 13 years since the town has sent someone to the police academy i was fortunate enough to be able to hire two other officers that do not need to go to the police academy because they are already full-time certified my my budget reflects expenses as they are with no added projects so no added purchases nothing added if you have any suggestions on where you'd like to see cuts if anything open to what you else to say really other than standard expenses that are gonna amount to a bigger figure this year every price and everything is done in a really good role in last year but the training to the academy is we have an officer going to augusta every week fortunate that uh i was able to make a deal with a paper community that's also sending an officer to the police academy we could split the expenses for travel and for lodging hopefully that deal can maintain for when the officer does go it's uncertain right now if the academy is going to take him in august they're taking 70 and he is number 99 on the list so i don't know yet the number 99 of over 150 okay wow graduated class with 70 yen it's the biggest class these are the biggest classes they've ever put through there's over 330 law enforcement vacancies throughout the state right now we're very fortunate to have staff that we have right now people have decided to come working for fairfield because of the community support and because of the support so that encompasses photocopier scanner the all of our cds dvds that we need for prosecution reports paper folders basically encompasses everything that we need to run the police station in the office and they all just put into it [Music] the last two cruisers we bought sometimes the first thing that people see when they come into the community that's important the second thing i see but first thing i look at my speedometer as you should no i have no questions on your budget very good if you can understand why we need to put money aside for a cruiser why are we not understanding why we need to put money aside for attention so there's a big difference in cost that's why you do this right so that's why we just put the money inside factor you need reserves but they're large sums of money because it's a larger more expensive piece of equipment so why we have to put the money aside now it's the same concept it's just a larger more expensive piece of equipment so relatively speaking putting seventeen thousand dollars aside every year in our capital programming which is our reserves which is tradition established foreign before i got there if you do that for an engine we will never meet the cost to replace the engine at that minimal amount so if your understanding of the cruiser it would make sense to me that you would be understanding like any piece of equipment that needs to be cared for planned for properly saved for so that at the time of putting that piece of equipment to bed you have the money to replace it properly instead of continuously going drmo for everything getting old pieces of equipment that are outdated and unable to run a year or two after we have incredible staff here that are very talented we are losing staff because of the turmoil but we still have some staff here that are incredibly talented that can do things that you can't do in some of these other communities without hiring the other staff and so we make it work the best that we can however we are at a crisis point here with this equipment because we're looking at over 20 years of not taking care of what we have for equipment and again making it look nice so that it looks good and it's respectable in the community however it's really not saving the taxpayers any money because we're now at that point where this equipment is outdated and can't be used i appreciate the support of the pd and chief knows this because we've had this conversation but what i don't understand is the lack of understanding for the same process with the other departments because they also need this time as well but i understand that no one wants an increase in taxes nobody wants that but we have to pay for the services that we provide and these budgets that have been presented that's all they are they are loaded literally to pay for the services that we provide and yet again our municipal revenue more than covers our municipal expenses these budgets that we are going over with each one of these department heads by over 500 000 and these and i understand and i appreciate councilwoman living your efforts to find a way to come to a solution but i think what you're going to find tomorrow when i go over all these numbers and suggestions that the amount is so minimal to the actual budget and the change in that budget versus the actual effect that it will have on the department and their ability to provide those services you are eliminating things that they need in order to move forward it is our responsibility to show you the council what it costs to provide those services and to not lie to you about what that is and that is exactly what we've done and it is the responsibility of all of us to provide for the future of this community and if we continuously head backwards again into well just cut cut cut the departments we're going to be right back to where we were 20 years ago and there's i mean i've shown you on the comparison of the mill rates i've shown you all the comparison of the municipal appropriations and the percentages and the numbers don't lie these are facts we only deal in facts in the town and there are no like grandiose projects that we're trying to plan for we're literally trying to maintain the services that we provide and i i really caution council in getting sucked into being concerned about paying for the taxes we all have to pay for our taxes every community around us is going through the same thing that we are not alone if you watch any of the other budget meetings from any of the other communities you're going to find the same thing everybody is worth everyone is concerned but if you have expenses that have gone up in your own home you have to realize we have the same expenses here but they are much larger scale because we are providing services for the entire community not just for a single council so when we go through and do these budgets that's what i caution all of my department heads are be cognizant of the fact that you are going to come across expenses that you have no control over those are things that we cannot remedy we cannot change the things that we can remedy and change are the the general things on the services that we provide and that's exactly what they did this is what they have presented to you and i'll be very honest with you as soon as we received the audit we stopped so this isn't we haven't been doing this since march we've been doing this since november and we've had many discussions our hour hour long discussions about what we're going to do moving forward realizing we are coming out of probably the worst economic disaster of all time the pandemic covid everything has really done a lot um to make it ineffective in what we're trying to do here with the growth of the community but we're still growing we're still surviving we have new families moving in here with young families young new families moving here we have new business we have expansion that's already been voted on and approved there's a lot of great growth going on here we are not a bedroom community we are a full-service community and we need to remember that when we are voting on the budget and the services that we provide the reason why they are here and why they come here those are just interesting so without what what you're saying is we don't think anything there's a budget that completed the way it is with our i understand what this is with some of the reserves but i mean i'm looking at municipal expenses and revenues for this upcoming year with this budget you're presenting now five million nine is fifty nine thousand right but our revenue which in our revenue is is six million four seventy two six oh five so we've got an overlay like just five hundred thousand dollars that's what the budget is presented right now yes that's the budget we are presenting to you now so but we're still one million nine hundred sixty seven dollars seven yeah because uh over because we are no i know and i know it's not coming for my town and it's not coming from the department's overspending and it's not coming from any of that but it still gets put back to the taxpayers and it's there's got to be some gift somewhere and it literally makes me physically ill but then why isn't the school but i'm sorry no and i get it i get the frustration and i went to the school board meeting and i voted but guess what there were four of us that voted so four that's it that voted no the others voted yes there were more people than that but if people really wanted that to change then we got to show up right and i kept preaching it and preaching it and preaching it and now it's too late and now something the town has to pick it up in it but why do we have to pick it up [Music] i think people need to start really paying attention to when they receive their tax bill what their tax dollars actually go towards because when you have a 19.5 mill rate and seven point three eight percent of your tax bill is going to the county and fifty nine point zero seven percent of your tax bill is going to the school and thirty three point five five of your tax bill is going to the town i mean that's a significant difference between the money that goes to the school versus the money that goes to the town and i will tell you there was a paradigm shift here in 1994 it was pretty much even between the school and towns up until that point and i mean i can conjecture which is based on facts but i won't do that here tonight i can write up a report for you if you'd like but that was the significant difference between the amount of money that went to the town in the tax bill versus the amount of money that went to the school in the tax bill and quite honestly the county's amount that they have been asking for has significantly grown and we really need to be watching that more carefully um and it's going to go even higher again we may be looking at half a million dollars soon from per county tax bill and that's significant in this town so it's the fact these are the facts our municipal budget what we need to provide the services for this community is more than covered with an overlay of over 500 000 with the revenue that we received with the work that we do these two entities the school and the county not that we don't need them not that we don't want them i just want people to understand that it is it is the largest amount of money where your tax dollars go when you receive your tax bill it is broken down for you and shows you where that money is going and when you continuously come back after us you you are going to deplete your services you will not have the staff to be able to run the services the way that you expect them to be run and this is why dc and some of the other department heads have said to you tell us what you want from us and clearly you don't want us to change the way that we do our services because everybody enjoys our top notch services we have great services here in fort fair but it costs money to run those services and we're doing them the best that we can with what we have and i don't mean by staff because our staff goes above and beyond every day seven days a week 24 hours a day 365 days a year and i don't think people realize the amount of effort above and beyond their actual job that they put in to making sure that these services are provided for our citizens i mean chief was working 16 hour days when he first got here sometimes 18 hour days just to make sure that we had the coverage that we needed to have and so we wouldn't have to go back to the sheriff's department again that's crazy and i think it's important for us to understand moving forward this 19.5 mil is our meal rate today 6.54 of that mill is all that comes to the tap out of 19.5 minutes 11.52 of those goes to the school and 1.44 goes to that portion of your task so it's it's important that you realize when you say we have to make changes we have to cut things you are essentially cutting the services because what you have been presented with is what it takes to run these departments to provide the services that are asked of us so again we will do whatever you tell us to do because that is our job and we take our jobs very seriously and the integrity in our jobs are very important to us however you when you cut that it removes the ability for us to be able to do those things and those are the decisions that council has to make people sorry jesus all over your presentation but i felt like that was the right time to have that i would just like since we brought people up just like they're they get a set like we have when we set our middle rates and stuff with the formula from the state the school does the same thing and with their budget for this year here was the state of maine on article 12 says that down to four fairfield should we fought before 1.1 uh one million one hundred ninety nine thousand seven hundred and eighty one dollars and sixty six cents but by then school but they got the additional our protein additional local funds so while the state of maine says we're responsible for 1.1 million for the for the school the school has added on another 993 thousand and fifty dollars and ten thousand six hundred dollars so it's one million three thousand six i'm looking at this saying well the states have i'm all required to pay one million as hard as taxpayer 1 million seven hundred and eighty 199 off and sixty six cents and then when the when you get to article 14 which is voted on mostly by in i was up at that it was 27 to four i left 27 i know that five or six of them from the school board the rest are all teachers family teachers or retired teachers voting on the budget for for the additional local funds if we if we're going to hold our municipality to a certain rate and a certain mill rate uh why should we be paying additional funds to the school department for 900 and some thousand dollars and cut away from what we need and that's been a pet peeve of mine for a while i didn't realize until a couple years ago that the state of maine recommends what the town has to pay for the school department and i didn't realize it and and how long has this been going on that the state and i know this formula has probably been the same for quite a while on this 1.9 million so every year we're paying a million to 900 000 over a million dollars extra to a school department that's in our taxes on 11.52 we're supplementing that extra cost we're supplementing extra costs this the school buses they got school budget that they send the bill to us so 21. so last year we're safe with one 1.1 million so there's not a million dollars they tacked on so it's not i think it was 900 000 i made this pie chart up to help me out and and to show people and i just can't understand why i mean we look at the red that's school department and we're looking at fit at 11.52 mills and we're trying to cut down a budget of 6.5 mils to keep the ivor tower going that's what i call the ivory tower because and i walk up around the school down and i've seen and they just got their third new bus their fleet is updated from federal money that they got that we never see anything from and they're hearing from dollar their their buses are all graded i see two nice new pickups up there the the the license plate the license plate up on there is all faded out but those nice nice trucks that we have we have to go out for the for the uh the highway department and we go out online to try and find the best of the huge thing that we could find somewhere we got to start looking at you know the cutting costs somewhere or say listen we need to get updated and right now and we're not looking at 6.5 million 195 you don't think i mean that's that bare budget last year the year before we did that the same thing people we we stopped taking money into reserves to to alleviate the taxes but when you got three new bus and they replace the buses every three years so may we and they get the best of the best you know take deal and we could complain because we got a couple new ambushes you know and and and now i'm looking at and hey we're going to get we're going again taking out the reserves to appease the school department that sends a bill of 900 some thousand dollars over what the state that we should pay so and again i want to say i we need our school department and that is not my complaint like my complaint is that you we have a group of citizens who agree that the school needs the additional 1 million 3 000 some odd dollars in order to run their school but we didn't even ask for an excess this year we have an overlay because we've been beaten down so much by asking for a simple excess we their 970 000 last year we only had 335 000 that we were asking for or around that amount so we were only a third of the amount and it it created pandemonium people lost their minds over it and it was only to be able to run the services to to provide the services for the citizens so if you can wrap your head around why it's okay for the school to be able to ask for these things and you can see the validity in it and why they need that i just don't understand why everyone keeps coming back after the town for the same thing and telling us we don't need it when clearly we do clearly we do well we've been a serious pandemic ahead of us if we don't start taking care of them apart i think people don't realize that the current state of the economy has increased demand on the services that this community provides including ems and fire and police and libraries because people are going outside and doing more now i mean we are over a thousand calls for service for the year already and that's that's basically handled 98 of the time us being short staffed we're running running to calls it's ridiculous and we're we're getting i mean yeah department uh we're looking at the highway department if only people knew what they're doing with the equipment that they have and the ability that they do it in and what our community asked for them to do and what they got to use for equipment i there's just a bunch of war on old trucks that they're trying to keep going and i said on the council five six seven years ago and i think there was a plan we voted on it you were supposed to have one fairly new truck rolled every year for the next three or four years i don't know what happened it just happened right okay i know but all i'm saying is it it's it's not just his department we got him that took a department he walked through a door there was nothing and he took it and what time he did with what he had to work with and brought it to where it is today what a what an achievement and we can't now look at his department and say well no uh okay you brought the department where it is but we're gonna we can't we can't give you the money to fund it now i refuse to do that i refuse to do that great job and if we get if we read revenue people overlay 512 000 on the budget that has been presented today without any costs i mean i just i understand i understand the need for past few years we've wiggled on the reserves because the one thing and the patches and the last year with the big debate and stuff like that and again we can only cut so much from the reserves that we can we don't we still have to build that up we have to have the capital in there to to fix these stuff because if one of those trucks decide to go today we're stuck and and by not having putting cash for windows i mean yeah and there's a reason why they asked for that reserve because this is what they figured it's going to be needed down the line and that's why i'm not for it i mean i'm all for helping the reserves and and not take away these if we could find another end let's bring in some revenue let's do it let's do a valley but you just can't keep cutting and taking this and taking that because eventually it's going to bite us in the keystone and say well why did you look at this the first time why did you plan for this before you had all the time you had all the opportunity to plan for before but to appease the first a few people because they you know listen well i i don't want to pay this you know we're a bedroom committee we're not a bedroom community and we're and to get our back you know we're worried about the tax base well we're only six point five we're only at 6.5 mills a cruiser don't cost as much as a fire drop i haven't made a recommendation but but it's still amazing but the thing is we're making recommendations we've got the reserves and then we're cutting our nose off the face and i don't want to be caught stuck in the in back and left fields and what you could have planned for before we got the opportunity right here in the planet to start putting stuff in the road and start going through and then the starting half of this and half of this and happened well the reason why we asked this is because this is what they figure they're going to need to replace something in a couple of years and just to keep cutting back that's why we've got the problem we're in right now for the reserve we'll keep cutting back having that cut back coming back when it comes time to that we need it and they're gonna and i know the taxpayers and then it's gonna say well why didn't you plan for this before i appreciate the value of the reserves i get it i'm 100 understand the value of the reserves and i understand that if we don't fund the reserves that we're going to end up in a pickle and get it don't know what else to do we went to the school nothing was accomplished nothing so now we have an almost two million dollar deficit to turn back to the taxpayers and i can't do that without at least trying we and we get that so i understand the reserves and i 100 agree i don't know what else to do at this point and i'm sorry but you we sit here in front of all of these department heads and i have honestly i've had it at this point we sit here and they expect us to guide them and make recommendations and we don't however we have people that go to the budget committee and can very happily give recommendations of all kinds of things and all kinds of bogus no rates that they expect these department heads to come up to and i'm sorry counselor but then you sit here and say nothing you can go behind the scenes you did you gave them a paper that said it was from all of the council with your recommendations of what we would like to see them do you also gave them recommendations of a mill rate that we would like to see obtained and then you brought that to council and presented it i did because but nothing is being said to bring it here so i sit up here and look like the bad guy making all of these recommendations of two thousand dollars that i think you should take off of uniforms it's a drop in the freaking bucket but at least it's something i know it's hard to share it is it is there's a lot of um there's a lot of tension and we all just trying to make it right it's not going to be right we have a two million dollar deficit that people are gonna have to pay kids are gonna kids already go without clothes in our town anyways my recommendation to the police department sorry um i would say two thousand opportunities for the uniforms two thousand off of office supplies and seven thousand off of the cruiser for a total of 11. seven off of the cruiser again these are just my recommendations the council must agree on it but at least yeah i'm looking at the police department budget itself i i would have to make a recommendation and how do you touch on the other departments exactly i i feel that there's recommendations mean something to everybody i really do but i also know that he's starting out with the fire department pardon me so is the fire department that's right and the ems true true like we're not trying to be argumentative no no no no that has to be shared it's only fair to share across all of the departments in order for there not to be any contention amongst them like why should they're not that i want one particular department to be cut or not be cut that's not even what i'm saying i just don't know i understand but we have to vote on it i mean there's one recommendation discounts on anything else for cheap numbers all right is my very top of the counterparts that really covered a lot of the topic we do have a few things that are exclusive to public works that we can touch on but first if i may i'd like to make an observation uh the the difference between the uh police cruiser and the fire truck nobody questioned the need only the cost okay the cost is instantly verifiable you can call and get the cost on that tomorrow the need needs to be determined now because if you're in the middle of a fire you're in the middle of a robbery you're in the middle of a snowstorm we need to know that you have the need for that equipment now we can't produce that on a moment's notice now we have an increase uh in the in the salary time but the council has already loaded on that we can't change it that's that's set for the next three years um benefits uh health insurance that the increase there is really just based on the crew needs um some people require less benefits than others that's really the bottom line and we have to have an increase in the overall sadly the rest of the increases i would love to sit here and tell you that that's for improved services it is not it is just four months ago i would have sat here and said it's just to cover the cost of increases i don't think it's wonderful that's becoming more and more evident on a daily basis it really i've heard the the needs and want thing it's just tore me up watching the budget committee talk about these and launching we have absolutely no wants in here it's only needs it's it's the need to provide the taxpayers with the basic services we we haven't been providing a cadillac service anybody rides on roads they'll test it out uh it's wonderful that you all live on town road actually because you actually get a good feel of what's going on out there ah i uh you know we talk about the increased cost of goods and that's really what it is across besides our salaries the budget committee has actually kind of bolstered our need i i heard one member early on talk about he had a friend that has a trucking business that the tires that formerly cost four to five hundred dollars are now two thousand dollars we we haven't seen that uh fantastic of an increase but we've certainly seen an increase anybody that tells you there's 18 inflation out there eight percent 18 we're seeing 25 35 50. in some cases 100 percent double the cost if you guys are all seeing that it has really had an effect on us um the uh i heard one committee member talk about that their roads are piled well enough that they can get wherever they need to go at any time i'm proud of that fact uh the chief of police that you've come and said that he when he was working for the sheriff's department that any time of day that he needed to go he could he could always get to where he needed to go in the town of fort fairfield other towns that wasn't the case don't let your town be one of those towns please i feel good about what we're doing i would love to do more but we need to keep up the end really the only thing other thing that i'd like to cover regionalization regionalization i'd just like to touch on that because there wasn't an attempt at public works at regionalization of our of our body shop when i came here they were doing uh paint jobs for other towns and maine a lot of them were for the forestry for the state when i saw what they were doing it was great what they were doing except for the billing they were charging half of the fully burdened rate of the employee that was doing the bodywork they were charging nothing for the facilities and they were charging nothing on the materials that were used uh as the the people that were using the service were bringing their own materials so therefore the taxpayers of four-pair field were you know they were really putting in over half of every job that was going out there supplementing the cost for other towns and other entities i really wish somebody would have come and asked me if that was a concern before i would have loved to explain that to them i don't think that taxpayers should be supplementing the cost of anybody on any family especially with that nature so what we did was we immediately increased the cost of that service we didn't stop doing it because we didn't want to do it i just didn't want the taxpayers paying for other entities to get job,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,d8WXOXz9q-w,"Budget Advisory Committee June 7, 2022 (1)",,60.0,3601.0,2022-06-08T13:46:49Z,none,56,1,0,0,well i copied it off was it friday morning i didn't i got it the second time like at the last meeting when you did it i didn't get it again it's mcgill right yelling okay did good morning [Music] a whole other sheet that's got all of them how much money they're made and this is just what they're asking yeah so for for example for reserves [Music] oh okay 606. it just started right here okay we have one member missing this evening billy gerald the rest of the members are here has everyone looked at the last week's minutes they have can we have a motion to approve or command their minutes to approve the minutes in last week's meeting as presented we have a second one i'll second it okay all those in favor business at this point we have our recommendation to the town council and we have not had feedback on that yet i expect hopefully thursday night they will look at that and see where they go all members of this committee are invited to go to that town council meeting thursday night six i believe four four four yes this morning and i believe they're going to have the department heads there and some discussions so what's the format for that meaning is it a back and forth with council and heads or council and the public it's back and forth i know in council and department heads village should get up and give like a presentation or answer any questions that the council may have and i believe that questions from the public will be allowed at that time as well okay so as far as i know and from the public is it like at the council meetings where someone can get up make a statement and that's all it is if they make a statement they sit down and that's i believe okay so it's a one-way conversation thank you any other old business so yeah new business okay all right if you got this an hour ago it's town council directions to the budget advisory committee has uh 13 suggested items that we could be working on we had three highlighted uh areas one being revenue opportunities they'd like to have us explore revenue opportunities to generate income cost saving ideas from employees to study how to incentivize employees for cost savings revenue enhancement opportunities and the third highlighted item was shared services investigate opportunities for sharing sharing services within the town and also with other communities and then other items on that is a town vision statement town long-term planning employee goal staff availability utilization budget process cost savings energy efficiency maximize available state and federal resources town valuation process group purchasing senior volunteer program so that's a pretty good agenda to-do list so we're not going to have too much rest off the budget season we will have a discussion on how often we do want to meet whether it's be thinking about that once a month or twice a month i certainly don't want to need it weekly i'm hoping maybe once a month will be sufficient so please review that you can might we consider something like divvying up some of these things and maybe having a couple of us working on one task and cover us for another task yes yeah sure certainly i think that might make sense yeah that's going to be helpful yes sir um so just to kind of clarify um i know that this isn't really the way that the meeting normally works and that you don't normally i just want to clarify on this list that this list is not from the council this is from a counselor the entire council did not we were all emailed this list to review um and we haven't discussed it or anything um i think the ideas in this list are good but i think there's some things on here that should be being done by the council um and that there's a lot of things that are being asked of you as a budget committee that don't have to do with the budget um so i think that those things are kind of muddy in the waters and it might help to clarify this list a little bit so i just want you to know that this came from a counselor not the council and that you know it is a good list of ideas but i think that there needs to be a little bit more clarification before you guys start putting a lot of hard will this be on your agenda in the next couple weeks again i believe we're going to talk about this in the meeting on thursday right so it should be covered but it hasn't actually been discussed by the council as a whole thank you all right any other new business acceptable great uh i if i sit down and write something out i might as well put it on paper and share all the right information i get the impression there are some amongst us as well as some beyond the committee you can have all of those at all who share the town manager's opinion that discussions between committee members outside of formal committee meetings are not allowed although i completely disagree with the town manager on this issue and i have data to support my interpretation of the rules that govern the actions of committee members beyond our formal meetings out of respect for the opinions of those advisory by budget advisory committee members who may agree with out town manager i come to this meeting quite unprepared to discuss much of anything i believe danielle had a topic she wanted me to discuss since according to this restricted opinion concerning committee members ability to interact outside of committee meetings it would appear that if danielle wants something discussed at a committee meeting then her request would have to be made enacted on a formal committee i had some thoughts about items i would have liked to have seen on the agenda for tonight's meeting but if two of us can't talk to each other outside of committee meetings then it would have been inappropriate for me to have a discussion with jason as chair of this committee concerning agenda items for this meeting it would also have been inappropriate for me to seek any feedback or input from any other committee members to me this all sounds childish immature and foolish and to the best of my knowledge is not based on any known rule or regulation it's a pathway to a very dysfunctional committee it's not how things get accomplished in the united states of america one can easily draw a conclusion that there are individuals in this community of ours who would like to eviscerate the budget activity committee's ability to influence the budget process and spending patterns of our town government i for one hope that we do not succumb to such an effort the stakes here are way too high this community deserves government officials and staff who are working for the best interests of our community i thought we were basically working well together this doesn't mean everyone needs to be 100 in agreement with everything we do it means that at our meetings we're civil we consider all opinions presented it means we process the information offered we draw our own opinions and conclusions based on what we understand to be right you're right my right don't have to be the same we vote thank you kevin i think you know to clarify one it's more than two individuals i think you cross the line when you get to three members meeting and having discussions about business whether it's the council or our committee and some other committees in town that could can be considered a actual meeting which isn't properly posted and noted and it's taken and so forth uh i think one on one if you know there's something someone doesn't understand or you've got a question i think it's fine to correspond you can email you can email all you want i i know i'm hesitant i never did as a counselor because i'd rather do things face to face and in in the public setting meeting and rather than have somebody want to go and go through my email something so that's a personal choice i've made and i know discussions of this group of that i've got to refrain i might make a comment that i agree with someone or something like that but i've left it as that i don't like the idea of conducting the whole committee's business on an email i think it's better done here that doesn't mean it can't be done and just be aware that there could be someone under the right to know laws that may has to and you you're required and you have a permanent record i'm sure of that you know but that doesn't mean you can't and it doesn't mean you can't talk to an individual or if somebody wanted to talk to me about an agenda or that's that's all fine good the freedom of access act is very very clear two people can get together when you for two people that's what they said there are some more liberal definitions i've seen something that a friend of mine had written from mma and it went to less than fifty percent of the committee uh and also address what you can and can't discuss and i'm trying to get a copy of that to share with people what i don't want to be holding something about i mean i i read the freedom of access act for cover to cover it's very clear that two is not no i i agree there's a number of three well to where we have seven on this committee three three three no you could do you know what well what is the freedom of information act says yeah i'm not sure the foa percentage of the committee yeah foa is is clear on two yeah there's no questions there two people can talk until the cows come home they they don't get very clear beyond that like for the legislature in augusta if three people get together that's a meeting but it's not clear to me whether that applies stuff but again you know i i'm i'm leaning on the conservative end i'll do one-on-one yeah and until i see something different that's where i'm going to start yeah and like i said there's you don't need to refrain from using email i i find uh i just prefer myself not to get in that cycle i i'd rather do it here let me ask if the email format is the group format yeah and there's three members having conversations without including the rest of the members in the group how how does that how's that impact i've not read anything on emails now that's a good question one of the things that i've done with this is just kevin and i'm as anal as they become any email i have that pertains to the work of this committee is in the file by itself and coming in because our emails are subject to disclosure yeah you know um any emails that i have that are just mine something that i'm researching some work that i'm doing conversation i'm having with aaron about what he had for supper last night and that's in a separate file yeah and i think that is the point is that if it's going to be the group email that's used amongst one or two or three people to have conversations without including the rest of the groups and what's the purpose of the committee it's like be inclusive yeah my request would be if you're going to use that format be inclusive for all yeah and you know and respect as we just you know we might want to break up into you know a couple individuals two or three people to work on a topic and you know but emailing particularly if you're going to only meet once a month may be very very handy but let's make that plan so that it doesn't feel like there's meetings being held right among the committee without all of the committee being aware yeah because that's gonna that that's gonna i mean i'll be happy with that yeah that'll start the threat of email too yeah too because that's not the way the committee is supposed to be formed it isn't supposed to be a small group within the group working for or against and there's good work that can be done in small groups and i i support that but i think it needs to come back to and be from the full committee first makes it a little bit more cumbersome but then you do have the email format that can be discussed and that can be set up that's you know it's kind of like the town council this isn't just one single member no some may be more zealous than others the same way with this committee but we're all going to function well right and i mean this to be completely you know out there i had requested um that kevin and i need to go over the sheet that him and tony had gone over and get his synopsis that way i could understand without looking at the form and being like i don't know what i'm doing right yes because i don't have three hours to devote to come to tony and get the full synopsis but he was told not to he couldn't meet with just one person so that's where this is all well it wasn't told not to it was recommended that it might not be the best the best thing so okay all right well we can you know as when we finish this initial process here and we look ahead in the future of what we're going to be doing after the budget is passed or whatever they do going forward we can have a little more discussion among ourselves to clarify how we want to do things and would that be good anything else on that heaven no it was just the issue of you know people getting together to work on stuff it is crystal clear foaa i believe is the most restrictive document out there does that sound right to you um so i know for the council we you know if there is more than two then it would be considered a meeting but for us we have been informed that email works the same if there are more than two people in email communication that would be considered immediate format things can come from the chair to the group but not from another counselor to the group you have to go through the chair and then jason would just kind of email blacks kind of you know see attached okay all right that makes sense and and honestly to put it on the table what bothered me the most was the initial response from danielle's statement about the clarification from your town you didn't see all of it i you might have seen all you thought you wanted to but there was more which which really needed to stay where it stated i i don't bite my tongue privately as well as i do in a public forum well i don't know also so it's agreed to can work together that's what you feel yeah it just doesn't feel good if you feel like there's a group within the group working together and it's like wait a minute i feel like i'm playing catch up well all she wants to ask was about a form to be explained it's not we're really going outside of the group right he just wanted it i mean i could have just gone straight to tony in abort diverted all the issues but i just don't have that time i mean it'd be a 6 30 meeting with tony to make it to work for eight and even then i don't think by when it started it'd be enough time so he's probably ground she was 30 in the morning yeah i think i was the only one here at 6 30 in the morning so okay anything else new business have we heard progress on the library not a word worth following i don't know how long that takes well i've been told it's just a matter of asking for the right papers and getting recommended and if it's a reinstatement and evidently so it's not a whole new reissue it's a new institution it's uh sorry we forgot to pay for work with here's the stuff you need to do it and what are you doing is it someone i'll say special that needs to do it an accountant and the trustees need to get together and do it how often do they meet today they just met not long ago and that's uh so they're the ones that need to do it okay anything else any other business or comments i guess we're sorry about that shortly if i may i wasn't here last time or the time before but what is the recommendation of this committee to the council regarding the mill rape or the dollar amount go ahead we made a recommendation for a mill rate of 22. and i've heard that definitely and they rejected that it was a five uh three to two vote at the council we got some feedback they wanted a dollar figure okay so we rewrote the uh recommendation you guys can correct me if i'm wrong and the wording was sublime to the effect of that the council strived for no more than 430 or 470 470 470 000 above last year's expenditures it's roughly this well it was roughly the same thing as the mill rating i'm going to throw a bunch of numbers at you you're a banker you may handle it better i don't need to go there i'm just wondering what the recommendation is where that stand is that's going to be taken up at the next council meeting they have acknowledged receipt of it i believe they will look at that thursday on their agenda next week yes all right i i don't i didn't mean to no no the numbers are all whatever see we we've been working on a town valuation of approximately 186 million we've been working with the understanding that a mill rate of 19.5 funded last year's budget okay so that was the basis of our discussion in the basis of our evaluation okay i don't know how many people are aware of this but the mill rate does not appear to have been calculated correctly last year and i played with some numbers either yesterday before and i think i have an idea where 19.5 came from but i'm not positive when you plug in the budget numbers driven numbers and you let the form do what it's supposed to do you wind up with 22 and change on the low end and 23 and change on the high end and when you again you're a banker you understate you overstate your revenues you wind up understating what you need to raise and the difference is 700 000 maybe something like that and that explains why we're out of money well thank you just for the committee's information i've been very concerned because the numbers i have are the original budget numbers it shows the two million dollar deficit that's what i've got to work with so i've been talking to some major landowners around all of them that i could think of and let them know that if that were to pass as presented their taxes are going to go up fifty percent plus 15 so most of them were not aware what's going on because they've been busy planting and shipping their seed and doing their business but of the people i talk to they're very concerned and i've invited them to contact the town manager to find out just exactly what's going on and to come to the meeting and be vocal ask questions because they can't afford the 50 tax increase neither in any of us really but realistically some of these farmers are paying 50 60 70 000 of taxes you got another 30 40 pounds on top of that that's a lot of a lot of money i've talked to one that's one that was considering building a building here and he says if that's the way the taxes are going i'm not telling anything about it however this is the initial budget as it's presented right yes this is not the budget effort that's the only numbers that's how many numbers were as citizens have okay but they're telling them there's assumptions right and to go around and and get everybody kind of wound up and kind of worked up and worried about the fact of something that isn't even in existence then it shouldn't have been presented in the first place pat if the numbers aren't estimated properly it should never been presented in the first place that's somebody's best guess i understand that but somebody's best guess yeah it's the initial budget presentation and it's always reworked and it's always there's always things that happen differently the final thing i understand the process i've been in this long enough i've been on the council i've been in this game long enough to understand the process as citizens out there are not informed as to what is going to change what may change and what impact that will have on the tax bill so no i think you know all any and all taxpayers that wish to express their opinion you know well i just heard should be welcome to do so and i encourage them too i've encouraged stiff barns to come griffith farms kill college fire uber fire lucerne farms from the crumb farms and blackstone farms i've talked to all of them and i'm not saying if that's what it's going to be but i'm saying based on the numbers i have that's what the council has to work with and until we come up with new numbers you people have to be concerned about what may have unless you get up and ask questions and be vocal so i just want you all to know what i've been doing in the background not to stir up the part and create a lot of ill will but to educate people what the process i just wondered if if everybody is aware of when the final budget vote takes place everybody know that it should be next wednesday so in a week yes okay thank you june 15 the 15th not normally normally it's a week after that i think it's scheduled for the 15th this year but you know okay there again where they they're going to meet this thursday if there's they may delay yeah that's all in their control my understanding yeah you've got two meetings left scheduled this month you've got the budget workshop that you have tomorrow and now your your june meeting to the best of my knowledge is on june okay well thank you very much thank you are you adjourned um [Music] the last couple of years also and i think if anything that could be learned from the process that we've dealt with here in north carolina the last couple of years before the numbers get put out at that public hearing to be considered for taxation to be considered to be adopted and to be discussed i really think that a lot more discussion and a lot more decision making needs to be done prior to those numbers becoming public information at the public hearing because that seems to be the fuel for the fire that's occurred the last few years if more could have been done within the department heads town manager town council in the meetings prior to this becoming public information be considered a lot of this i think could be it wouldn't be happening well i think if that work was done you know years and years it always was done yes it was pretty much close to a final product very much so jason yes and all of a sudden the last few years it's all of a sudden it's like here's this wish list it gets put out there for consideration it gets the taxpayers and the public all up in arms all concerned what happens is then you get a lot of negative energy bouncing around a lot of people that are getting excited about about this so when you take a look at a two million dollar deficit and you don't have to be an accountant you don't have to be a business owner if you're talking about 186 thousand dollars raising a million you do the math yeah and with that information this this is one of the problems because for years and years people were used to those numbers being presented at the public hearing being very close to the numbers that were going to be adopted there was never this tumor in all the deficit stuff so if nothing else we learned from this process i hope going forward that they do a lot better job before they present those numbers to the public i agree with you tom those should have never been presented they're just so farfetched that they should have never come to the meeting searching would kind of meet prior and start working the budget earlier you can talk to anybody who has been a department head or a town counselor up until the last three years there was never amounts put forth like that at the public hearing there was a lot of work done prior to a lot of discussion a lot of back and forth but to come up with the two million dollar deficit and present that for public hearing to be considered here in port fairfield unheard of until recently so thank you i know on the proposed list kevin just circled it you know they've asked us their a counselor has the rest blessed or not to look at their budget process and you know if they put that task on us uh you know we'll can we draft him to work the only other thing that i would mention is the second part of that academy it really puts an awful lot of pressure on those high people oh yeah and it's not fair those counselors are there they're voted in office to take a look at the information that's presented to them and after a lot of hard work with department heads town management they work the numbers they look at the programs but unfortunately what's happened is lately it has really been a situation where there's a lot of pressure put on five town councillors to make the decision as to how much money this town was going to spend and i'm not saying there haven't been difficult times in years past but nothing like i've seen the last few years and that's a difficult job for those counselors it is a difficult job but they're in control they're the ones that have to bless it or not it only takes three i mean everybody else works for them down the line so that's the way it's supposed to work thank you okay thank you for your comments anything else folks um i did mention in my correspondence to andrea the town manager that miss anne fully had brought up the work program um and that it needs to formally go to council in order for it to proceed or if you can send it to the town manager and she'll bring it to the council that's what she advised me to announce so i can attach the notes all i want but it has to come from the town manager which counts billy joe has originally asked for the information so i supported it but one other question when you were talking about that i remember reading for you guys to work anywhere it has to be a 501c you have to be a non-profit non-profit but this town uh i worked for i worked here right the term nonprofit is not necessarily the same term as 501.63 okay the term what the whoever came up with the name non-profit should be shot in the world it's got nothing to do with profit a non-profit entity has no stockholders that's the only difference okay a 501c3 that's an irs designation like if you're a 501c3 and i give you 100 i can deduct it from my income taxes so i guess is 501c3 part of the description of what you're allowed to work with or is it just the term non-profit okay [Music] because i was still in the program and worked for eight hours yeah library any government any town office i guess and i guess we'll probably have that it's hoping to get some feedback from clearasd and you know see what comes from the council thank you i guess i'll make a comment i can't speak on behalf of the council but i can speak on behalf of myself i appreciate the hard work that you guys have put in um it's a really quite a challenge um this year with the budget and all of the turmoil that come with it and putting yourself in those seats you get a little bit of the taste of what our seats feel like it's not super fun but i do think that we're all here for the common good of the town and the citizens and taxpayers like we're all trying to do the same thing so hopefully when we do vote or whatever changes we need to make between now and then um you know people do take that into consideration that we are trying to do the best as a whole and that you know my thought is that probably both ends of the spectrum we're gonna have to give it's not gonna come from one single place it's not gonna you know come from just departments or taxpayers i think it's really gonna have to come from all sides and you know we'll have to review like i guess as a group but it's a hard seat to be and where you guys are so i do appreciate the work thank you we appreciate you sarah's counsel anything else folks all right see you thursday night we had a motion to adjourn i will say you haven't signed up [Music] oh my god that road well i was in the biomass business and one of my biggest suppliers is this is or more yes it sucks but we've already looked at it and yeah the plan on thursday is [Music] is those numbers [Music] nobody's i know there's an email from ella i ask that i'm trying to figure out some of those numbers that are in these forums because it's a waste of our time and one of the things that i've learned is make sure you have the right freaking facts right and have the right numbers in front of you so i said i sent an email to andrea yesterday morning saying i've got uh an income statement that i picked up at the 95 here is it still active and same question with the consolidator you know i'd like to see that was david i just think that there's a lot of work um tension that has built up between last year and this year and i think that maybe you guys are getting some of the following from it so i just think that that's but again like that should be yeah cost of insurances and expenses so it is different but yeah that could work but right now we could do it before and then kind of have it already pre-kind of squeeze it down and then compose it and then we can give a set amount to the departments and say here's how much money can the people afford fairfield afford to spend okay so you come up with roughly a number of sometimes okay as a manager this is what we have to work with you to sit down with your department house and figure out you would like to be and my terminology is top down and what we have right now is so we've bought them up the department has asked for everything they can actually okay but when you have that process all of a sudden people start moving you down okay versus up front joel made a comment at one of our earlier meetings that the tax rate was calculated last year have you heard that comment so i just told him actually just mentioned it to me and i was gonna um does it have to do with revenue yeah that's what tom said he said that um the revenue sharing from the state was counted twice it boys um or made sure i don't know that's i hope because [Music] so hopefully that will become i mean that should be right there so that so the people don't question the reserves oh yeah we know what that's about so that's a that's a good thing hopefully that [Music] is [Music] do you have um he said please give me your ideas this is the form that we use to calculate the tax so this is the money you've ever raised they're having a meeting i'm just sitting here okay so that's the direction you're sharing yes okay so you're thinking that this number is a very good medium yes something 51 okay one yeah hopefully some members here on thursday i'm going to see resident sharing i'm sorry i'm sorry but that is kind of the poison that is like making this committee biased well no i'm not sure it's not if he was one sharing it came from uh councillor yes and he brought it to mr barnes and no it's not approved officially but that's going to be approved officially at the need however it shouldn't be given to the committee until the committee's work is finished and the vote the budget vote is in a week this could you know this could be asked for guidance seven weeks ago not from an individual all of the group um was asked to share and anybody who wanted information in fact the council chair is the one who highlighted and prioritized the list so there was input there from anyone who wanted to could provide input and then at the council meeting which of course that's not until next week then the council will have a chance to review it until everyone's reviewed and approved it it was just a it was just a crazy thing to share the information with the committee that's all that was there's no there's no um action being taken here there's nothing else just sharing the information so that they wouldn't feel the council had ignored their requests so i wanted you to know that okay so thank you 212. i apologize i've had my fair share this number includes all these other numbers okay and so this and this includes okay i see what you're saying so this sheet has 800 million of revenue sharing that's good together so that way i have the information in front of me when i try to explain it okay that way i can say okay full full disclosure i'm not an accountant well nor am i okay i mean i have a degree in finance but it's different than you know right and i am by no stretch of the imagination an expert municipal bye,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,foX46E_SxQI,"Budget Advisory Committee June 7, 2022",,43.0,2564.0,2022-06-08T11:46:59Z,none,35,0,0,0,[Music] accounts right now so they're going to just add very much too much in there that would make sense this morning 606. it just started right here okay we have one member missing this evening billy gerald the rest of the members are here has everyone looked at the last week's minutes we have a second old business at this point we have our recommendation to the town council and we have not had feedback on that yet i expect hopefully thursday night they will look at that and see where they go all members of this committee are invited to go to that town council meeting thursday night i believe four four four yes this morning and uh i believe they're gonna have the department heads here some discussions so what's the format for that meeting is it a back and forth with it's back and forth i know the council and department heads that they should get up and give like a presentation or answer any questions that the council may have and i believe that questions from the public will be allowed at that time as well okay so now and from the public is it like at the council meetings where someone can get up and make a statement and that's all it is if they make a statement they sit down and that's i believe okay so it's a one-way conversation thank you any other old business so yeah new business okay all right if you got this an hour ago it's the town council corrections to the budget advisory committee uh has uh 13 suggested items that we want for the record that we could be working on had three highlighted areas one being revenue opportunities they'd like to have us explore revenue opportunities to generate income cost saving ideas from employees to study how to incentivize employees for cost savings revenue enhancement opportunities and the third highlight item was shared services investigate opportunities for sharing sharing services within the town and also with other communities and then other items on that is a town vision statement town long-term planning employee goal staff availability utilization budget process cost savings energy efficiency maximize available state and federal resources town valuation process group purchasing and senior volunteer program so that's a pretty good agenda to-do list so we're not going to have too much rest off the budget season we will have a discussion on how often we do want to meet whether it's be thinking about that once a month or twice a month i certainly don't want to meet weekly i'm hoping maybe once a month would be sufficient so please review that might we consider something like um might we consider something like divvying up some of these things and maybe having a couple of us working on one task i think that might make sense yeah that's going to be helpful um so just to kind of clarify um i know that this isn't really the way that the meeting normally works and that you don't normally have someone here to stand up i just want to clarify on this list that this list is not from the council this is from a counselor the entire council did not we were all emailed this list to review um and we haven't discussed it or anything um i think the ideas in this list are good but i think there's some things on here that should be being done by the council um and that there's a lot of things that are being asked of you as a budget committee that don't have to do with the budget um so i think that those things are kind of muddy in the waters and it might help to clarify this list a little bit so i just want you to know that this came from a counselor not the counsel and that you know it is a good list of ideas but i think that there needs to be a little bit more clarification before you guys start putting a lot of hard work into it so thank you will this be on your agenda in the next couple weeks i think um i believe we're gonna talk about this in the meeting on thursday right so it should be covered but it hasn't actually been discussed by the council thank you all right any other new business haven't you had something you won't give up i have a statement i'd like to read into the community that's acceptable if i sit down and write something out i might as well put it on paper and share it so we get all the right information i get the impression there are some amongst us as well as some beyond the committee you can have all of those who share the town manager's opinion that discussions between committee members outside of formal community meetings are not allowed although i completely disagree with the town manager on this issue and i have data to support my interpretation of the rules that govern the actions of committee members beyond our formal meetings out of respect for the opinions of those advisory but budget advisory committee members who may agree with our town manager i come to this meeting quite unprepared to discuss much of anything i believe danielle had a topic she wanted me to discuss since according to this restrictive opinion concerning committee members ability to interact outside of committee meetings it would appear that if danielle wants something discussed at a committee meeting then her request would have to be made enacted on a formal committee meeting i had some thoughts about items i would have liked to have seen on the agenda for tonight's meeting but if two of us can't talk to each other outside of committee meetings then it would have been inappropriate for me to have a discussion with jason as chair of this committee concerning agenda items for this meeting it would also have been inappropriate for me to seek any feedback or input from any other committee members to me this all sounds childish and and foolish and so the best of my knowledge is not based on any known rule or regulation it's a pathway to a very dysfunctional committee it's not how things get accomplished in the united states of america one can easily draw a conclusion that there are individuals in this community of ours who would like to eviscerate the budget activity committee's ability to influence the budget process and spending patterns of our town government i for one hope that we do not succumb to such an effort the stakes here are way too high this community deserves government officials and staff who are working for the best interests of our community i thought we were basically working well together this doesn't mean everyone needs to be 100 in agreement with everything we do it means that at our meetings we're civil we consider all opinions presented it means we process the information offered we draw our own opinions and conclusions based on what we understand to be right you're right my right don't have to be the same we vote we look forward thank you uh i think you know to clarify one it's more than two individuals i think you cross the line when you get to three members meeting and having discussions about business whether it's the council or our committee and some other committees in town that could can be considered a actual meeting which isn't properly uh posted and noted and it's taken and so forth i think one on one if you know there's something someone doesn't understand or you've got a question i think it's fine to correspond you can email you email all you want i i know i'm hesitant i never did as a counselor because i'd rather do things face to face and in the public setting meeting and rather than have somebody want to go and go through my email somewhere so that's a personal choice i've made and i know discussions of this group of that i've got to refrain i might make a comment that i agree with someone or something like that but i've left it at that i don't like the idea conducting the whole committee's business on an email i think it's better done here that doesn't mean you can't be done and just be aware that there could be someone under the right to know laws that may have to and you you're required to have a permanent record i'm sure of that you know but that doesn't mean you can't and it doesn't mean you can't talk to an individual or if somebody wanted to talk to me about that's that's all fine good uh the freedom of access act is very very clear two people can get together and you have two people there's no question that's what they say there are some more liberal definitions i've seen something that a friend of mine had written about mma uh and it went to less than 50 percent of the committee it also addressed what you can and can't discuss and i'm trying to get a copy of that to share with people what i don't want to be holding something about i mean i i read the freedom of access act for cover to cover it's very clear that two is not i agree with you information act say i'm not sure the foa percentage of the committee yeah foa is is clear on two yeah there's no questions there two people can talk until the cows come home i agree they they don't get very clear beyond that like for the legislature in augusta if three people get together that's a meeting but it's not clear to me whether that applies stuff but again you know i i'm i'm leaning on the conservative end i'll do one-on-one yeah and until i see something different that's where i'm going to start and like i said you don't need to refrain from using email no i i find i just prefer myself not to get in that cycle i i'd rather do it here let me ask if the email format is the group format yeah and there's three members having conversations without including the rest of the members in the group how how does that how's that impact i i've not read anything on emails now that's a good question one of the things that i've done with this is just kevin and i'm as anal as they become any email i have that pertains to the work of this committee is in the file by itself incoming it up going because our emails are subject to disclosure yeah you know um any emails that i have that are just mine something that i'm researching some work that i'm doing conversation i'm having with aaron about what he had for supper last night and that's in a separate file yeah and i think that is the point is that if it's going to be the group email that's used amongst one or two or three people to have conversations without including the rest of the group then what's the purpose of the committee it's like be inclusive yeah my request would be if you're going to use that format be inclusive for all yeah and you know and respect as we just discussed with the uh the possible uh directions for the from a a counselor uh you know we want might want to break up into you know a couple individuals two or three people to work on a topic and you know but emailing particularly if you're gonna only meet once a month may be very very handy but let's make that plan so that it doesn't feel like there's meetings being held right among the committee without all of the committee being aware yeah because that's gonna that that's gonna i mean i'll be happy with that yeah that'll start threat of you now too yeah um because that's not the way the committee is supposed to be formed it isn't supposed to be a small group within the group working for or against and there's good work that can be done in small groups and i i support that but i think it needs to come back to and be from the full committee first makes it a little bit more cumbersome but then you do have the email format that can be discussed and that can be set up that's you know it's kind of like the town council isn't just one single member no some may be more zealous than others the same way with this committee but we're all going to function well and i mean this to be completely you know out there i had requested um that kevin and i need to go over the sheet that him and tony had gone over and get his synopsis that way i could understand without looking at the form and being like i don't know what i'm doing right yes because i don't have three hours to devote to come to tony and get the full synopsis well it wasn't told not to it was recommended that it might not be the best the best thing yes and then i got my eyes down i couldn't see anything so okay all right well we can you know as when we finish this initial process here and we look ahead in the future of what we're going to be doing after the budget has passed or whatever they do going forward we can have a little more discussion among ourselves to clarify how we want to do things you know people getting together to work on stuff it's crystal clear foaa i believe is the most restrictive document out there does that sound right to you so i know for the council we you know if there is more than two then it would be considered a meeting but for us we have been informed that email works the same if there are more than two people in email communication that would be considered meeting format things can come from the chair to the group but not from another counselor to the group you have to go through the chair then jason would just kind of email blacks kind of you know see attached okay all right that makes sense and and honestly to put it on the table what bothered me the most was the initial response from danielle's statement about the clarification from youtube you didn't see all of it i saw it no you you might have seen all you thought you wanted to but there was more which which really needed to stay where it stated i i don't bite my tongue privately as well as i do in a public forum well i don't know also so it's agreed to can work together that's how you feel yeah it just doesn't feel good if you feel like there's a group within the group working together and it's like wait a minute i feel like i'm playing catch up well all she wants to ask was about a form to be explained it's not really going outside of the group right he just wanted to follow him i mean i could have just gone straight to tony in abort diverted all the issues but i just don't have that time i mean it'd be a 6 30 meeting with tony to make it to work for eight and even then i don't think by when it started it'd be enough time so please buy them uh he's probably ground cheaper yeah i think i was the only one here at 6 30 in the morning so okay uh anything else new business i thought sorry have we heard progress on the library not a word well i've been told it's just a matter of asking for the right papers and getting recommended and if it's a reinstatement an evident way so it's not a whole new reissue it's immediate to reinstatement it's uh sorry we forgot to work with you here's the stuff you need to do it and what are you doing is it someone i'll say special that needs to do it an accountant and the trustees need to get together and do it how often do they meet today they just met not long ago so anything else any other business wasn't here last time or the time before but what is the recommendation of this committee to the council regarding the mill rate or the dollar amount we made a recommendation for a mill rate of 22. and i've heard that yeah and they rejected that it was a five uh three to two vote at the council we got some feedback they wanted a dollar figure okay so we rewrote the uh recommendation you guys would correct me if i'm wrong and the wording was submitted to the effect of that the council strived for no more than 430 or 470 470 470 000 above last year's expenditures it's roughly this well it was roughly the same thing as the mill rating i'm going to throw a bunch of numbers at you you're a banker you may handle it better i don't need to go there i'm just wondering what the recommendation is where that stand is that's going to be taken up at the next council meeting they have acknowledged receipt of it i believe they will look at that thursday on their agenda this week yes all right i i don't i didn't mean to no no the numbers are all whatever see we we've been working on a town valuation of approximately 186 million we've been working with the understanding that a mill rate of 19.5 funded last year's budget okay so that was the basis of our discussion in the basis of our evaluation okay i don't know how many people are aware of this but the mill rate does not appear to have been calculated correctly last year and i played with some numbers either yesterday before and i think i have an idea where 19.5 came from but i'm not positive when you plug in the budget numbers revenue numbers and you let the form do what it's supposed to do you wind up with 22 and change on the low end and 23 and change on the high end and when you again you're a banker you understate you overstate your revenues you wind up understating what you need to raise and the difference is 700 000 maybe something like that and that explains why we're out of money well thank you just for the committee's information i've been very concerned because the numbers i have are the original budget numbers it shows the two million dollar deficit that's what i've got to work with so i've been talking to some major landowners around all of them that i could think of and let them know that if that were to pass as presented their taxes are going to go up 50 so most of them were not aware what's going on because they've been busy planting and shipping their seed and doing their their business but of the people i talked to they're very concerned and i've invited them to contact the town manager to find out just exactly what's going on and to come to the meeting and be vocal ask questions because they can't afford the 50 tax increase neither in any of us really but realistically some of these farmers are paying 50 60 dollars of taxes you got another thirty forty thousand on top of that that's a lot a lot of money i've talked to one that's one that was considering building a building here and he says if that's the way the taxes are going i'm not telling anything about it however this is the initial budget as it's presented right yes this is not the budget effort that's the only numbers that's how many numbers we as citizens have okay but gary's telling them there's assumptions right and to go around and and get everybody kind of wound up and kind of worked up and worried about the fact of something that isn't even in existence in the first place pat if the numbers aren't estimated properly it should never been presented in the first place that's somebody's best guess i understand that but it's somebody's best guess the initial budget presentation and it's always reworked and it's always there's always things that happen differently the final thing i understand the process i've been in this long enough i've been on the council i've been in this game long enough to understand the process we are not informed as to what is going to change what may change and what impact that will have on the tax bill so no i think you know all any and all taxpayers that wish to express their opinion you know well i just heard should be welcome to do so and uh and i encourage them too i've encouraged smith barnes to come griffith farms kill college fire uber farm lucerne farms from the crumb farms and blackstone farms i've talked to all of them and i'm not saying that that's what it's going to be but i'm saying based on the numbers i have that's what the council has to work with and until we come up with new numbers you people have to be concerned about what may have unless you get up and ask questions and be vocal so i just wanted you all to know what i've been doing in the background not to stir up the part and create a lot of ill will but to educate people what the process should be so that's my son i just wondered if if everybody is aware of when the final budget vote takes place everybody know that it should be next wednesday so in a week yes okay thank you the 15th normally it's a yeah after that i think it's scheduled for the 15th this year but you know there again where they they're going to meet this thursday if there's they may delay yeah that's all in their control my understanding yeah yeah you've got two meetings left scheduled this month you've got the budget workshop that you have tomorrow and now your your june meeting to the best of my knowledge is on june 15th okay well thank you very much thank you are you jared um [Music] the last couple of years also and i think if anything that could be learned from the process that we've dealt with here in north carolina the last couple of years before the numbers get put out at that public hearing to be considered for taxation to be considered to be adopted and to be discussed i really think that a lot more discussion and a lot more decision making needs to be done prior to those numbers becoming public information at the public hearing because that seems to be the fuel for the fire that's occurred the last few years if more could have been done within the department heads town manager town council in the meetings prior to this becoming public information be considered a lot of this i think could be it wouldn't be happening well i think if that work was done you know years and years it always was done yes it was pretty much close to a final product very much so jason yes and all of a sudden the last few years it's all of a sudden it's like here's this wish list it gets put out there for consideration it gets the taxpayers and the public all up in arms all concerned what happens is then you get a lot of negative energy bouncing around a lot of people that are getting excited about about this so when you take a look at a two million dollar deficit and you don't have to be an accountant you don't have to be a business owner if you're talking about 186 thousand dollars raising a mill you do the math yeah and with that information this this is one of the problems because for years and years people were used to those numbers being presented at the public hearing being very close to the numbers that were going to be adopted there was never this two million dollar deficit stuff so if nothing else we learned from this process i hope going forward that they do a lot better job before they present those numbers to the public i agree with you tom those should have never been presented they're just so far fetched that they should never come to the meeting searching would kind of meet prior and start working the budget earlier you can talk to anybody who has been a department head or a town counselor up until the last three years there was never amounts put forth like that at the public hearing there was a lot of work done prior to a lot of discussion a lot of back and forth but to come up with a two million dollar deficit and present that for public hearing to be considered here in port fairfield unheard of until recently so thank i know on the proposed list kevin just circled it you know they've asked us their a counselor has the rest blessed or not to look at their budget process and you know if they put that task on us uh you know we'll can we draft him to work with us the only other thing that i would mention is the second part of that academy after that it really puts an awful lot of pressure on those high people oh yeah and it's not fair those counselors are there they're voted in office to take a look at the information that's presented to them and after a lot of hard work with department heads um town management they work the numbers to look at the programs but unfortunately what's happened is lately it has really been a situation where there's a lot of pressure put on five town councillors to make the decision as to how much money this town was going to spend and i'm not saying there haven't been difficult times in years past but nothing like i've seen the last few years yeah and that's a difficult job for those counselors it is a difficult job but they're in control they're the ones that have to bless it or not it only takes three i mean the uh everybody else works for them down the line so that's the way it's supposed to work thank you okay thank you for your comments anything else folks i did mention in my correspondence to andrea the town manager that miss anfield we had brought up the work program um and that um it needs to formally go to council in order for it to proceed or if you can send it to the town manager and she'll bring it to the council that's what she advised me to address so i can attach the notes all i want but it has to come from to tell me which accounts billy joe had originally asked for the information but one other question when you were talking about that i remember reading for you guys to work anywhere it has to be a 501c you have to be a non-profit non-profit but this town uh i worked for i worked here right so you can work the term non-profit is not necessarily the same term as 501.63 okay the term not determined whoever came up with the name non-profit should it's got nothing to do with profit a non-profit entity has no stockholders that's the only difference okay a 501c3 that's an irs designation like if you're a 501c3 and i give you 100 i can deduct it from my income taxes so i guess is 501c3 part of the description of what you're allowed to work with or is it just the term nonprofit okay [Music] i guess and i guess we'll probably have that it's hoping to get some feedback from thirsty and you know see what comes from the council thank you i guess i'll make the comment i can't speak on behalf of the council but i can speak on behalf of myself i appreciate the hard work that you guys have put in um it's a really quite a challenge this year with the budget and all of the turmoil that come with it and putting yourselves in those seats you get a little bit of a taste of what our seats feel like it's not super fun but i do think that we're all here for the common good of the town and the citizens the taxpayers like we're all trying to do the same thing so hopefully when we do vote or whatever changes we need to make between now and then um you know people do take that into consideration that we are trying to do the best as well and that you know my thought is that probably both ends of the spectrum we're going to have to give it's not going to come from one single place it's not going to you know come from just departments or taxpayers i think it's really going to have to come from all sides and you know we'll have to review like i guess as a group but it's it's a hard seat to be in where you guys are so i do appreciate the work thank you i appreciate you sir anything else folks all right so darren see you thursday night we had a motion to adjourn i will say we haven't signed aaron um [Music] i got to know them one of my biggest suppliers is the other side,True

limit where the atvs can go in fort fairfield because i've had experiences with atvs taking right away jumping out in front of me in traffic um overloading their atvs and not i'm not seeing all of the people that have atvs do this but there are some out there that are doing it so it's unsafe for these people even in the atvs if they come into occlusion with a car guess who's going to lose and that's my opinion and i believe the opinion of my spouse but i'll let her make her own determination on that thank you for your comment thank you is there anybody else that would like to speak good boy here for fairfield before stagnant um i disagree because there's always going to be a few bad apples and they can ruin it for everybody else if you're following following the laws everything should go smoothly should that's not always the case like i said you're going to have a bad apple somewhere whether it's atvs or whatever you're doing i just went back to atvs because i missed it and i'm not picking on nobody here i'm just saying my opinion if you follow the laws everything should go good should go good mr boyer if i may clarify for the record you begin by saying i disagree i don't disagree i mean i'm sorry you're in support of the ordinance's draft right i am thank you very much is there anybody else my name is kevin stratton and i support the ordinance strongly support my name is jeremy neal and i support thank you for your comment and i would like to present these comments in writing i will attach them to the record okay thank you very much council will receive all submitted comments thanks man my name is cindy heffer i live in 19th church street and i am for the ordinance thank you for your comment is there anybody else i would like to make a comment mr objective uh my name is steve jeske and i live in the north carolina i only oppose the audience because i think that we could make that a better order than this and make it work better for other people can i speak to that tonight yeah you can either be for or against or if you're neither for nor against you would like to see a revision that would be part of your comment we recently purchased a place down in eastern market and the comments made to me when we were in the process of buying the place was that they were they're an atv-friendly community and they told us that we weren't using that for construction purposes down there they could find many many people who would rent that and it has been a big room for east milner in milan i don't know what's involved in an at friendly community and what they cover but it may be to our advantage to have someone speak to them down there and see what the pros and cons were and see how their audiences are written to see if we could make that as friendly as possible and be useful along with that when we revised the audience under the audience i had a couple of concerns that i had and i don't know enough about it and i'd like to have someone looking for us if we open up some of the roads or the roads that are out there does the town become liable at all for any accidents or injuries that happen on those roads because we opened roads up in the state doesn't recommend that we do that i just like to have that pot looked into um and my experience with atp's in town is the enforcement for atvs is traditionally inland fisheries and wildlife uh and and whatever we do in our audience to enforce it we got to make sure that those people were willing to work with us on that because certainly our police department can't do reinforcement we're busy with a lot of other things uh my conversations with the game ones were they're not necessarily in favor of open roads and when i asked about other towns that i atv failing they could not speak to that because they weren't familiar with what was going on in those vietnamese talents so i don't oppose it i i think that it's a good economic thing for the town of warfield to do i think that we need to do it in a way that's been proven in other towns uh there's no sense in us to be invented in the wheel they could tell us to try the tribulations again and certainly they can tell us about the enforcement piece so mr rojeski to clarify your position you're neither for nor against it your support concept that revised exactly thank you anybody else i'm for the ordinance and from what i've seen over the last three years through my business a lot of people across the country didn't even know four fairfield even existed until they started doing business with us and rentals and they have gun and atv rentals and they actually enjoy our town from what they expect to see of it and there's more people coming up into our area each year want to do outdoor recreational sports and either they're bringing up their machines or else they're renting and they like what they see up here compared to other places they've been in the past you know so thank you very time hi my name is elon ortman uh our driver for fairfield i oppose for the ordinance uh we got some of the best trails out there people talks about us and it's a revenue for you guys let them come in i don't spend their money it's not cheap to ride without so i oppose it thank you for your comment sir call will you call me editor hi my name is ed france and uh i live in san river and uh i'm for the atv because you know it's i mean i'm about to say however and that's a long ways to get into town and stuff and i'd have to trailer it and then it's kind of foolish it takes the fun out of stuff you know as long as you obey the law like duke said you know you always have a certain percentage or you know but hopefully they can get stalked and straighten them out but i i i'm for the rev i mean the uh whatever it is ford is 22.04 thank you is there anybody else that would like to speak about the ordinance make comments about the ordinance is there anybody else that would like to make comments about the ordinance is there anybody else that would like to make comments about the ordinance not hearing any additional comments i'm closing the hearing unless you want me to let him speak with yes and after i'd already asked three times am i only allowed to say that i'm opposed or favor this no but you have to have uh i'd like for those that are opposed to this to know that state law says that we can go 500 yards on the road and three quarters of the people that live in town are within 500 feet of 500 yards of main street so you've got 75 of the folks here within in town they're allowed to use these roads by state law all we're asking for is the remaining 25 they live on these same exact streets to be able to use the streets that others are using legally thank you for your comment thank you i have 20 minutes after six i'm closing the hearing is there anything else you'd like me to do no thank you i'll have copies for the council before their next meeting thank you very much tony okay next uh we've got uh industrial park k-powell expansion discussion great so we are not having much luck with the main international trade center and they have directed us to the governor's office and um decd so but they are willing to work with pdi paypal pdi um in their international expansion whenever you are ready to do that but as far as the industrial park parcels we it was a strikeout for that so it's council's discretion what you'd like to do and that's how we left it at the last meeting okay um you can move forward with your three-year proposal that was presented um or we can go back to the drawing board gain industrial services three pounds approximately two and a half acres for one dollar to be developed within the three years of the property uh we handed over to him and they had three years to develop the property do we have a second [Laughter] oh just don't touch it and it will clear hopefully can you hear us kevin close he doesn't answer it you hear us i think it's because there was a call coming in yeah that should yeah you uh that should stop any second hit a button and don't there you go there we are so we had a motion and a second we'll go to both uh uh next we got other yep and there was a whole bunch of things that came in at the last minute here so we have the budget advisory committee's information and we'll make sure that you get a copy of that counselor you're welcome this is the next set of information that they have given to council to take under advisement i'm sure we can talk more at the dream night department meeting and that will give my department heads time to um um and there was a recommendation made for the sbcds program which we used to uh do in the town with um right and then we have the next one is the promissory note with aws the short-term loan as previously discussed last year at council meeting there is unique opportunity this year again with bigger square solutions they have a reserve account that they can offer one percent interest rate from sereno to the member municipalities they are able to offer us 275 000 loan that will be paid back by november 30th 2022 recommendation is that council allows the town manager to sign a promissory note as discussed with aws and this is that cash flow crunch that we have from june 1st to 2 30. okay we do but we really shouldn't be using our reserve accounts for cash flow this is this is for cash flow only until the um we have over 400 000 in tax money that we don't have collected yet and once we have that collected then we will pay back that promissory note and this helps with cash flows this is what i was talking about back in january that we traditionally do not budget for cash flow for the very last month of our fiscal year and we usually have to get a tan but there is a much better opportunity for us because it's only one percent versus anywhere from three to seven percent yes i i agree and that's why it's a short-term loan and that's why it's in we don't have cash flow currently and we need to have cash flow to get to the end of the month and this is this is the least expensive way to do that we do not i believe it's less than 800 yes the reserve is less yes yes yes you're welcome mr chair i make a promotion that we allow tom anderson from certain notice discuss with aws okay we had a motion we need a second okay well we gotta have a second and then have discussion just the way it is i know can't have a discussion right now we got one motion on the day wait a second then we can go to discussion did you second did you hear what's going on kevin so we gotta have a second to go to discussion but the only way we can discuss it we gotta have a second on the motion right but the only way we can discuss is i have to have a second on the table and then we can win the discussion all right so we had a motion and a second now we'll go to discussion i can say from experience this is a frequent event i've served i i can say eight nine years on the council and this is just an event that happens at this time of year um had the farmers had a normal growing season uh as far as getting on the ground uh we'd have seen that interest change as far as tax dollars but this is one of the earliest springs they've had in a long time and you know they they were on the ground in april so it makes a change there plus the revenue sharing that was scheduled to come in uh at the specific date and it has every year uh was delayed this year it's common practice i i can tell you uh doing this so revenue sharing from the reports of the bba uh we're down roughly 75 000 from what google but it's it's common practice of what this is that well looking at it in two different contracts it would look and appear to be that but if you look at the contract in itself and the that we have set up and then look at this one separately it's it's not and it's it isn't it isn't um like i said it's it's it's like having ten apartments and with everything going on the people are living in it and the tenants come to you and they say well i got the money but i can't get it till next month and the state guarantees the money and it's delayed a month and and you have to run down and and grab some money out of the bank to roll your transaction it's it's it's guaranteed funds it's just how can i put it it's not it's not an investment loan it's just a carryover 30 days it's right it's it's going to be gone if you see what i mean and if we don't do it it's it's just going to change a lot of paperwork a lot of book work a lot of strategies that's going to be the long way to fix it where this is just this is just a shortcut to fix it um well it would if you didn't have the funds to show that it was going to cover it then then anybody would worry but under the circumstances the the funds are there they're calculated and there and more so it's not like looking at a a can loan that you're looking and turning a page and you see where am i going to get the money there's nothing there we do have it it's just it's just a quick fix well the only problem with that is is if we have an emergency of some kind if we have right right but today in in the municipality financial world you could be looking at something happen uh you know at public works you could have something happen you know at another department you could have a you know a periodic state inspection of some kind and have to turn this over immediately it's just nice to know you've got that security in the bank well that's what we're doing yeah i mean it'd be different if this was a long term it's not it's a it's a 30-60 flat out well no that's right i i take them words back six months that's just for taxes that come in right where we have 400 okay yes did you hear all that kevin well i i have to apologize because i i'm getting some some i ain't getting something so i feel the best  you wanna make the motion all right we've already got emotion yeah we got a motion in a second once discussion is done we'll vote but this this you know i i'd be at the edge of my seat asking many questions and and i can't blame you know anybody to uh there again there's a lot of things that take place that you're going to experience being first time on the council and you you pick up oh i know but but just serve and i'm saying on municipality and this this is common practice i've seen it many times come across the paper it's always uh well if everybody's that you you discussed enough kevin yeah all right so uh we'll go to both uh mitch jim kevin and i bowed eye oh what do we do so so uh is is this uh immediately okay that's why i brought it to aws as well and it's very clear with all of them for the same reasons a way to handle your split decision without a second motion tablet until you're next week thank you um i mean at this point um the only thing are we free to discuss this further off this motion right now that we settled okay um so as we stand taking it out of the reserves is that going to interfere with the lot right so we cannot use reserves payroll you can't use them that's that's why you have reserves accounts for specific that's why the reserve accounts have specific names to them like the repair and maintenance reserve account or a truck reserve account or any of those types of reserve accounts playground equipment reserve account and they have to be used for those ideas sure we really need to change the wording from reserves to capital improvement because it sounds like a big savings account it's really out there for improving equipment to the idea is good kevin that we can jump in but but municipality government law won't prevail the town manager to go in and use the reserve accounts for casper no it's a good question no you can yeah and they got payroll and whatnot to me so at this point yeah can't take another reserve account there's whatever counts is up for certain things so understanding kevin the difference between the reserve accounts can't be used for cash flow can we reconsider this so we can keep the town moving for another couple months oh i agree so we need another motion yeah we need a motion to approve the um the promissory note from aws 275 275 the financials through what we figured the 275 will put us right where we need to be and that's your commotion all right i'll second that motion okay we had a motion in a second we'll go for vote mitch jim kevin and i bow die next on the introduction of fire and rescue services cost recovery ordinance yeah so the point of this ordinance is the state allows municipalities to build for cost recovery related to fire services if there's a municipal ordinance that allows them to do so there's not a state law that allows them to do so what i've done is i've talked to a cost recovery service that works with over 250 fire departments in maine and new hampshire i've used wording from numerous other municipalities to create our ordinance that works for us and fits our call volume and the types of calls we go to so what this would allow us to do is bill insurance companies for fire related costs responding to fires responding car crashes cleaning up hazmat spills any type of fire related costs that isn't covered by ems billing this has nothing to do with ems bill there is one part in there revenue it would it's recommended by cost recovery that that be used go into a reserve account for equipment replacement which would help us with everyone being reluctant to fund reserve accounts that would give us something towards our reserve for our equipment replacement mr chair i'd like to introduce ordinance 2205. [Music] we had a motion in a second oh does this for a public hearing yeah okay for public hearing are we on the club are we allowed to ask questions i can if it gets to the point of a discussion with us comment public comment period uh has been over but if you you're proposing additional revenue to the fire department will that reduce the funds that the town needs to generate for the fire department well i'm sure that we will discuss on june 9th yeah i was just going to say that discussion on june 9. but that is a good question [Music] all right we have the minutes from wednesday may 18th oh sorry the second public vegetarian made ship and the council meetings on wednesday may 18. you have the minutes from the second public budget hearing may 5th yep these are the two big packets and then the minutes from the council meeting on wednesday for may 5th 2022 and may 18th 2022. we had a motion we have a second set we got a motion in a second again kevin and i will die anything else mr chairman make a motion all in favor say aye i want to thank everybody for coming tonight thank you yes thank you very welcome good luck thank you,True

it's oh no see the bread you will be able to fix it for your pet [Music] i know that for sure mapleton you take the laptop you don't plug it down is it oh my gosh that's what i tried to ask you about yes did you find your wife oh yeah god talk about not knowing what you're doing this is this would be it for me today okay last night [Laughter] if you want kevin i'll pass around my computer and you can read them real quick so danielle at some point like maybe tomorrow can you come down to the shop no i had a hard time spelling frontier at 8 30 at night i kept typing it and it wasn't like it tried to correct it and i was like why i just saw half of the two ambulances okay okay yeah i saw that i'm going to email janet again you know what i can mess with this and i'll miss half the meeting or i can do this later if i need to know anything there might be um certain spam blockers especially for you at work so look in your in your junk frontier pharmacy dot us right kevin okay oh good i recognize his hand pharmacy with the network volunteer pharmacy do you need to read them real quick he's got a coffee oh okay janet do you want to read it off man he's gonna he's gonna help him i had that a couple weeks ago yeah it's not nice it's been crazy it's gonna there's a freaking frost tonight yeah i know i haven't bought them up and then i got only one little row and then all my cucumbers are about like that i wanted to talk to me i wonder if it's going to see if what's his name had anymore had any raised bed um ronnie yeah i literally like sat down in bed and i was like oh tomorrow was monday and adam looks at me it was it's tuesday tomorrow and i was like ain't got errands on my tail in my defense i didn't even know what day it was that day because i was medicated that sinus infection just wiped and wiped me one for the permanent file and then i can share villages my minutes come out in english them in french i could yes you could is that good maybe a few choices in there okay uh i'd like to call this meeting to order 608. that the records show that all members of the committee are we have a motion to approve the minutes of may 24 2022. second motion is second all those in favor dairy old business i believe that's not the minute that's not the minute oh it is there's some wording that i'd like to see it okay worked differently all right that's why we're right here it's it's it's more just to make it easier to read then i think the first sentence should say the fort fairfield budget advisory committee makes the recommendation makes the following recommendation to the fort fairfield town council period or nicole you think we should strike the following something to change just leave it just that we make the recommendation that we make the following recommendation to the fort fairfield town council i think the reason we have gold is we're trying to make it clear that this is not a fixed remember this is an attempt you know but in my it's an attempt you know they may wind up with a smaller number with a bigger number they may make the attend and make no changes and that's explained down in here the word goal to me is very defined and clear and specific it isn't it's specific i mean it's just kind of language specific as opposed to you know because this is the goal this is the recommendation and it does say in there that things are subject to change and we know that this is after committee makes the following recommendation makes the following recommendation to the fort fair protein council and you can put comma subject to change up or down if you want but i don't know kind of well i think you've got a goal in there that shows they have the leeway i agree so keeping going in the first step first sentence or okay keeping it in the motion yeah so the first sentence would be the fort fairfield budget advisory committee makes the following recommendation to the fourth careful town council semicolon motion reads that the town council direct the town manager to work with the town department to review and realign proposed budgets to a total goal that would be supported by an increase of 470 000 generating for property tax revenues [Music] further explanations we understand that the mill rate and the property evaluation are subject to change with that in mind the committee based their recommendation on the evaluation of approximately 186 million dollars at a meal rate 22. this number is an increase of roughly 12 and a half percent over the budgeted property tax revenues for the 2021 2022 fiscal year next paragraph this would allow for a marginal increase in the meal rate to accommodate inflation related items while maintaining current levels of existing service and keeping the burden on taxpayers as low as possible this change is slightly more than double the cpi change from january 2021 to january 2022. last paragraph the budget advisory committee recognizes that this is ample justification for higher levels of spending just as there's is ample justification for lower levels this level of spending creates before fairfield taxpayers as a point of reference the increase proposed in this recommendation is a fraction of the increase proposed in a fiscal 2223 budget submitted to the capital just that first sentence kevin loves it well i mean everything that's in there is everything right has been it's a presentation of a town council and the town council will do what they want with it updated without a second any discussion i hate putting my name in a second because i don't want people to think okay and um any other old business and it's not that he doesn't want to talk with us it's that the subject of assessment is an entire course college program i spent two hours with him friday i don't understand exactly i i have a better feel for the form in the process than i did friday morning but you know there's six seven of us here around the table [Music] yeah the business there is a town council meeting jim [Music] regarding the business that wants is that the one regarding the business that wanted to see about the property yeah but the meeting after is that about the the people who wanted to buy the land yeah okay okay unless they need to go home today or [Music] and by inclination i don't think they have danielle was you gave to finalize this and or well kevin's got the pizza it doesn't matter to me either way i can get them back to them tomorrow okay so you want me to get that to them business hours tomorrow questions 27.24 they actually the one that we actually ordered secret balance okay uh anything else folks the only other uh you know it's kind of frustrating for us i think it is yes nothing else that was just the information that mrs hell brought up yes program the a-cap program you talked to us indicated they have to have a resident in ford that they're giving services to but the a4 td is the program that i recommended for mature older and there was a lady here who was interested that i gave the information to and she was interested in libraries thank you um um i also realized last year the town budget was passed with 353 575 where could that deficit be this year in other words it may be another conversation part of this but the directive here with this motion is talking about the tax taxpayers but i don't know if it has anything to do with the actual spending based on what seems to be a pattern from year to year of passing a budget that's got a little bit more of a deficit part of this conversation maybe you should be taking a look at this because who's to say that maybe this year a way of working to get more money um we've not discussed it specifically um one of the things that frustrated me personally and some of the elements of all systems we basically from our um the budget as presented to the council uh and then at the end of the day you want it up to the past um for years so the point spending more [Music] so let me ask if the deficit is also added into that sheet by you right the the form that calculates yes so the deficit is added into that and that's where the state makes a recommendation for a mill rate is that a year right right this year but all of that is generated here the small input field is all calculated here and when you go through the form that is entered correctly when you get down to the bottom you've got a low in the height right between the children where so last year when they went lower than even the lower recommendation they picked the low they picked the lowest they picked the bottom of the yeah so just that has to add into or connect with the deficit somewhere well the deficit gets passed at the end of the day they haven't used none of the departments at this point that i've seen in actuals have used their full budget the only ones that are concerned about maybe going over budget and not to pick on ems but it depended on the overtime hours and if the budget was passed at the next meeting then he'll be fine if he's going to go into next year using this year's numbers obviously he'll be screwed but that's out of his hands and over time and extra causes out of your hands as well you know yes we're hot but janet i understand what you mean like kind of like look at you look at what you have now and kind of be like okay that's our nest egg now you know or kind of protect it kind of i mean you always want some sort of reserve i know rainy days right now it's it's zoned really strangely yeah it's i think it's just regulates it yeah do i put this in a minute scary where did you see those numbers they shouldn't even try to look again um that's sort of a silly question but how we've got any thought to the budget the fiscal year goes july to july 1st to june 30th of moving it from calendar january to december and what do other municipalities do and the school budget would all be set and there wouldn't be so much guessing obviously it's you'd have to do like six months of a you know changeover but is it a law that it has to be that way the the state budget is it is a law that it has to go is it no different the municipality can choose whatever for seven years i would exactly when it got changed to a fiscal year there's good arguments both ways i think one of the common arguments is so that the school's budgeting year and the town's budgeting has become the yeah yeah superintendent doug actually made that statement at the budget meeting how thankful is that the town of fort fairfield is a july june july 1st to june 30 yeah crystal town and it helps them with their budget so i don't know why but that is what he said well what happens is if the town in the school has got different fiscal years then somebody's budget is going to get juggled and spread over the other party's two pistols right it's not impossible that it just releases sometimes we i think anyone else do you have a motion 37 minutes we keep like we were what two hours then an hour and a half an hour we're getting better yes i just,True

six o'clock may 24th and all members of the committee are present [Music] have members have a chance to look at the last week minutes okay you want to take a few minutes and take a second look at those so must so so so um okay we're ready to proceed uh can we have a motion to approve the minutes or if there's any errors or corrections being made to let and all those in favor all right may 17 old business i guess our old business goes i guess our recommendation uh i can't sum that up yes uh i wasn't here but that's all right um i presented a packet of information to the town council uh there was a little bit of a discussion on it the motion the motion we had recommendation we made was moved was seconded it was voted only down the other thing i had asked the counselors for is uh more direction from them as to what they are expecting of us we're kind of like on our own autopilot here okay um i they made no mention of anything at that meeting and i've not heard anything else anyone else has also the town manager did comment that in the numbers that we were using there were errors i'm not sure what those errors were i have not had any any feedback on that i mean i i acknowledge this is if there's an error we'd like to know about it yeah straighten this out unless you got the questions of the time council presentation i think i got the understanding they're basically what would like to have us present numbers and and be clearer perhaps okay yes yes i have had that discussion that's part of what bob kilcollins called me about today you know instead of talking about mills can we talk about numbers yeah you want to have that conversation here i reworked the proposal in and promotion aaron helped me straighten out some words that i had a hard time with thank you that wasn't great i want to do that now well absolutely you know i think uh you know that's the route we're going to have to pay if we're going to we have a handout that talks about the formula that's used this is this is a this is the proposal that we were investigating the diagnosis right right but i don't know if the formula is correct to use but that's okay we've got a new formula that we can look at correct right yes it's the same dollars that's at the end of the day mills well that's when we made assumptions of using last year's numbers for the formula it will come to a dollar figure of what we would be requesting them to cut the budget yeah now that cut could be all expenses or it could be offset by some additional revenues they may have but however they get here i mean if property valuations go up and there's a higher assessed value well that's more income for them to spend absolutely certainly an option you know the adjustments can go anywhere i think we were pretty clear i want to take a moment you know that's so cute let me just yes okay the first page yeah two sides is my attempt at reopening that i double or triple spaces so that you all have rooms and i don't want to transition that you've got you got room to play with that the other the other two pages that are attached there are essentially what i had attached last time and i i think we can do some work to condense that some more i just ran out of time yeah okay so where are your numbers coming from um [Music] the change from 1995 to 22. that's still dealing with mill rate mill rates and dollars are the same thing it's just two ways of looking at the same thing so but number wise where did you get your numbers to figure 471 thousand i rounded the we rounded the evaluation at around 186 million when we were talking about the assessed value of property that's taxed it's like 185 9 something or something it's real close to 100 these aren't my numbers this is what we were talking about yes yeah i i just i concur you know last week we discussed that we'd be looking at roughly 471 000 increase over last year's project or you know budgeted expenditures and that's what we felt would get us to the 22 meals that we targeted so i think that's the correct approach that we can't have any more net expenditures than 471 000 increase increase i mean that's pretty simple you know the other option i mean we we do not have time or want to go line the line uh you know i i you human i did that and i lost everybody's attention last week but you know i guess my point the whole exercise is how difficult the process is going to be for the town the councilors to get there but i mean that's the task that i guess we want to assign to them and see how if they can make it work what i tried to do we had a lot of our supporting stuff was part of the motion last time and what my little brain came up with what i that second paragraph is bold i think is the motion and then everything else just supports it again i have to bring up the school i know people think that the school is not is an off topic that we can't do anything about it we can still be present and we can voice at the at their budget meetings just like anybody else can in their form of government there's nobody holding them to a line they've got all the increases that they've asked for nobody has gone to them to ask them to tighten their belts whatsoever and when they make their increase that is also an increase on us it's an increase that increases our over all budget as well if you look at this year's usage not one of the departments has gone over budget at this point they're all under budget yeah um that's pretty incredible considering that we reduced the mill rate to 19.5 last year oh they got a good history of that they certainly they do have a deficit here's what we're going to have a wake-up call when the mill rate is not 19.5 this year right that's what i'm saying but that's why i bring it up but you can't bring it up all at once but that was part of the discussion last year with the town council when they decided to go 1905 to calm some of the fears i guess about tax increases and raises there was a discussion about what's going to happen when it hits next year yeah it's going to be up and it's going to be higher than we're comfortable exactly so why we need to cut the budgets and try to keep it yes there's inflation rates and we kept it within that line we gave them double the national inflation rate to and that's where the numbers came out for us yep so i mean 1400 in the fire department almost 600 percent in the uh rec department um it's not sustainable so what we're asking is that the council recommend um that departments submit their needs as opposed to their wants the process would be a negotiation between the town manager can i address the school issue please yes certainly the only thing that matters at the town level as far as school budgets are concerned is the portion that's raised from property taxes okay because everything else town council has no control over it that's great okay the school budget fiscal year 1819 2008 82 777 school budget fiscal year 22 23 2 203 0432 from 1819 to 2223 that is a 5.8 percent increase and you look at all the debug the departments all the budgets nobody was even close the closest one is other that was six and a half percent [Music] i look at what our taxes what our tax dollars are spending for our school system and i say they've done a freaking outstanding job i don't know what the total budget is i'm sure it's gonna have more than that but total budget doesn't really matter it's the town's tax portion is what matters that's agreed you know but the the point that you know citizens as well as counselors you know the more they can voice to the school board their concerns and to see if there's anything they can do to lower anything it's a good effort it's well worth effort uh you know we've done that in the past i think it was effective uh you know and there i don't think what they're asking for is unreasonable but uh like kevin says but again important for their before when they before they vote is important i suggest that anybody can get there do so the school's increased from 21 22 to 22 23 it was 1.06 but we also have to consider the school got lots of federal money that's irrelevant well it isn't it may be irrelevant or relevant for us but it still has to do with how the school is managing their money yeah wouldn't you think they'd be able to ask for less money from the municipality if they've got if they got a bunch of federal money the federal money had to be spent on certain things or they lost it so it's hard to ask them to spend it on something totally different when that's where the money is but we don't know what those certain things were so i guess that's where we should be going to the school budget here and find out again i encourage people to do that but uh that's beyond our scope at this point i feel right just like the revenue sharing and the county taxes i mean we're not going to influence that here so what we can do is simply recommend to the uh town council what we'd like to have see to have them do and you know i think what kevin has put down is uh precise and numbers that we have seen at bitcoin that's like with um library they get their 501c3 back and i've got somebody that's willing to help me set them up and do a campaign to get them some grants because they can't get grants from the foundations that i mentioned last week if you don't if they don't have that stats that's right and that really needs to be you know who has the authority to get them to do that i'm not authority about is that their trust board of trustees has to be on board to do that they're working on it she told me i spoke with her again today and i think it was andrew swanson was originally doing it for obama but he's too busy so i guess he decided not to do it and now they have i can't remember who she said was doing it but i mean if i need it shawn newman is the chair the truck the trustees so that's uh i told her she wants me to call and i can you know stress how important that is that you get that because she needs firmness she needs in our roof she's got some shingles that are downstairs but they're not enough there to do a roof and i had somebody look at those pictures and again said major major repairs or a full roof and that stuff yep you know so if we can pull that all together and try to do a campaign to get everything for in grants yeah that's going to save the town that's an excellent idea the 501c3 i mean my experience is whole but when we set up pine cell services yeah uh one of the corporations we set up was a 501c3 yeah it's just someone needs to understand how to fill out the forms and how to dock the eyes and how to cross the tees to satisfy i think it's irs is who makes the rest of the approval and it's just you find someone who knows how to how to put the information in the form the way they want to see it and you have to have somebody willing to maintain the records because every once in a while you do have to send ongoing proof of the filing process and absolutely what i understand [Music] no that that 501c3 for the library could be a game changer for her for her yeah yeah absolutely absolutely right that's a reserve account that wouldn't either 150 for the roof and then so just for everybody's benefit yes i just went look the school board budget has been posted they are voting on their budget from 26 which is in two days so a few more voices opinion getting out of the boat on the 26th at six o'clock at school right now at the high school add it to my camera okay [Applause] any more discussion on the proposal kevin you know the way he's restated it or you have any more you want to explain about it kevin what i'd like to do unless they have an emergency meeting next week don't have time to come back i i'd like to take the last three pages and try to condense that i think there's some but the the piece that matters the piece that's our emotion is that first piece of paper on the is the the last pages they've already gotten that right yes so while they go yes they have gotten the last except for the little asterisks at the end i would suggest that we're going to meet next tuesday there's i doubt the town is going to have a meeting between now and next tuesday monday being a holiday i think that's a safe assumption uh let's rework the back up with this uh yeah i'll be available to collaborate as well and then we have put a do a good motion forward next week and can you help us with the words again please we should all be included in those emails any other topics on the old business yes we keep forgetting this thing we have to decide who's one year and who's two years i never saw that but can you it's just uh it's a part of the charter i knew it was i read initially chart okay we all have this if we go out i'll leave it out loud here this is the budgeted advisory committee ordinance and it says members shall turn serve turn serve for terms of two years for transition purchases the initial turns shall be staggered so that as nearly an equal number of turns shall expire so there's seven of us so three or four of us get one year times and the other three or four of us here two years ago i asked if the council when they appointed us that designated pool was one year not to my knowledge you're not supposed to go there billy joey kelly joe okay we're we're gonna have fun doing this yeah you guys are gonna come back two years is it worthwhile asking if the rest of our last meeting other than the 12 minutes that are posted exists as far as a digital copy you mean kevin well when you go to the new uh for the airfield the first meeting i think everything's there i mean i didn't look at it for a minute right stand through it and then i could go a long ways down the list to find last week's and there's only 12 minutes there so i thought [Music] on the yeah like my computer otherwise than that you just have to fall back on the minutes which are approved and now permanent record okay any additional business new business um personally i want to try to set up a meeting for me with tony roback to have him educate me on how assessments work the appraisals were because it's all tied in to all this and before i go ask him for me i was wondering are there other committee members that would like to have that same interaction if there's a just a handful of us maybe we can find a time that works depending on us or if the whole community wants it and we see if you can come spend some time with us at one of our communities we've been asking if you could appear next tuesday that you'd be willing to i mean i got a bunch of questions and when i look at stuff i always try to do this sometimes it's not i figured tony's the guy you know i said i'm the only one looking for that i don't because it's so critical to the whole process that we're going through to make sure that we're looking at the correct numbers you're looking at the correct formulas if you wish i'm trying to close the language um kevin not sure did you see the email from miss powers this afternoon i saw the worksheet i saw it like 15 minutes yeah so maybe we can print it and have tony kind of work us through it too that would be a good idea i knew it was an attachment i knew yeah i scanned it as well but yeah it's a lot of numbers to digest yeah [Music] 3 30 this afternoon so the other question i have is i show up at these meetings with stuff would you like me to send those to you i would wouldn't be a bad thing what all that means is i'm gonna have to get my act together because if you're still personally i mean you have a problem right to look at first that's what i'm saying is if you would like to see i think we should have a conversation about where we go from here yeah differently um we we looked at the organs we look at the feedback from the budget meetings we did what we thought we should be doing we went to learning council with god except we could speculate to the house and home what i'm wondering is you know is we're just going to get voted on in a couple of weeks other than this this is probably all we have to work with you know like do we want to pursue some research about shared services we but you had a wonderful idea uh about sharing staff you know what other types of things general things out there that maybe we could start tackling until the council gives us more specific direction i don't know if we you know we've got much time to give this oh no no no no this is not for this you know this year this this is going going forward forward i i i can see the process if we start you know december january but this process working closely that you've got a lot more time yeah i think to wrap up before this session is done uh you know we can get a few ideas for them just to stimulate their thoughts uh i think i think it'd be helpful you know well you know one of the things i thought was like we know they're already talking about ambulance service doing transport and so forth and they're up to speed to be able to do that another ambulance online i guess that uh they think they can be in operations uh escape i have a question how does that work yeah i i don't know who has yeah that 22 requests so i don't know if it's like an open door it was a short period of time but they had 72 calls that they could participate in depending on the level of service depending if it was just basically key service i think it's just right or if it was service transfer right lights and sirens down ambulance that the water transfers a huge long-term purpose yeah back and forth that's that's captive that's when people are being transferred back here from hospitals down south you know they have surgery they're recovering from [Music] and the other thing that happens but you know the ambulance needs some scrutiny but i'm not ready to scrutinize them and i'll do fairness to them i need i'd like to see their pro forma that they put together yeah i'd like to see where they're at right now actual versus what the first one was absolutely are we getting close to where we need to be historically ambulances ambulance service has been crazy lucrative i've talked to communities where the ambulance paid for itself plus the fully funded fire department now that's not current data i do not know if things have changed since the information that i had um i know nobody in healthcare is losing money they're like they'd like you to think they are not um i can tell you that i've started doing some research on just the exact same thing and some of the problems right now that ambulance services as everybody else is suffering is finding staff that are willing to work staffing issues other reasons why there are transports that are being looked for in other sources they can't keep if they can't keep their ambulance crews staffed they can't do additional transports that was one of the things that went through the back of my mind when we were talking about you know picking up this transport business are we staffed to do that and i don't know i mean yeah that's another question that registered i don't know but i'm glad to see that they're thinking about generating revenues there and that i can understand it takes a couple years before you can get to that point but i don't it's a tough build i think the staffing pattern that's happened in the past year has been a little bit difficult for everybody to get there yeah every department every business i don't know where everybody went that used to work but they aren't working now that made it too easy to stay home and i think some of it's still out there i'm not sure and even the incentives lately have been ridiculous i mean twenty thousand dollars for an lpn i mean that's a nine month course and i could have my lpn for cna twenty twenty thousand dollars incentive so yeah nobody but we are fully staffed downstairs ems and there's quite a few paramedics who are willing and ready to do transport so they want to do that that's what they like but they don't have the vehicle so now we gotta get around and go that's right that's right well ultimately yeah they do well and that was within that's that ambulance purchases this fiscal year not what we're working on so so jason i know you said you watched the last meeting did you did you um this public the public hearing the next meeting that the council is going to have with department heads yes invited this committee to attend for information yes for each department well state suggested suggested that that would be a really good i think that would be a wonderful thing then we get to hear ourselves from each and every one of those departments yeah where they're at what they yeah i think that's very important really are you coming in on that it's going to be on june 9th june 9th yes where it's a special meeting and department is it may be different kind of different we'll just follow up with andrea i think later this weekend melissa yes do you know what time the meeting is scheduled for i just checked and i will let you know and i think just because we're looking at next year or the year before i don't think it's out of the question to make a recommendation to council to start even another group to start researching transports and shared services or whatever yeah i think we're the logical body for that you know um are we going to be taken seriously to go speak to to other towns and it depends on the pool you send and it depends on how it's packaged and how the negotiations go if you go negotiate with irving woodlands for anything you know they don't want to give you anything and they want you to give them everything if you negotiate with somebody where both parties that are negotiating are looking for a deal that works for both and either both are profitable or like in our case both are saving money or both are doing it providing better services for the same money and both sides share and benefit equally that's the making of a long-term deal and the the example i use is try community oriented yep you know it's now called acoustic waste solutions and that almost brainchild that was but it's freaking awesome no i i think uh you know a couple individuals from the not the whole committee but a couple individuals from the committee maybe a counselor or maybe the town manager you know joe and i think they would be received well i know when we had an economic development committee uh you know we paid visits to businesses like uh you know rodney mccrum's business and mars hill and you know trying to encourage is there something they may do here or something and you know we had some good conversations with businesses outside of fort fairfield and uh this is along the same line and uh you know and we have meetings with preschool here who are on it's ambulance services when we are trying to negotiate uh contracts and uh their their doors are open and we had good discussions the the vision i had is pretty much what you're saying you know uh one or two or three individuals or maybe one or two of us and maybe we know someone else in the community that would like to join us on whatever topic you know shared services is an easy one yeah you know i would like to have a discussion at some point of the budget there may be a better term for this because you already have about not there's two ways uh to do budgeting with departments i call it top down the bottom up and i call what we have right now bottom up department heads put their wishes together that's assembled goes to the town manager uh it's tweaked and goes to the council and if i was a department head and bottom up system my freaking budget would have everything out of the sun well i i you know they explained that maybe that's how it's done but i know i'm not haven't got experience with this current manager but prior managers they put a pretty good inkling out to their department heads where they thought they'd want to be i mean and then they took it from there so i mean so that's more the top down it is but you know they it they don't refer to it right like a steve did you have a question i thought you raised your hand know so that the discussion of that is something that that interested me yeah at some point along the way i you know my history with their the process you know i explained last week i thought worked very well it wasn't that difficult process but i think mr toll kind of yeah described the same process yes you know and it has changed in the last few years and here we are it's not good just just to interject for a second jason you're absolutely correct what used to happen is that department heads would prepare budgets generally we would be given some parameters and those parameters would be directed by the town manager and i'm sure that there was conversation with council that would give everybody an idea prior to getting into the budget process real heavy or too far into it so everybody sort of knew what we were looking at for numbers and typically the numbers were very conservative that were presented to to council when we used to present our budgets to the council and work session and typically we would take that um the input from the council and sometimes we'd have to go back and we'd have to readjust and we'd have to take a look and we might have to trim we might have to change a little bit so that by the time the budget was presented to the public hearing which is what we've already had back a couple of weeks ago it would be a budget that would be in line with two to three percent increase per year maybe per budget some years were exceptional it might be a little bit more in a particular budget because they had either equipment needs that they had to have addressed but typically by the time it got to public hearing it was a budget that may have been a couple three percent more than the year prior to and there was a lot of feedback prior to with carbon heads town manager council prior to anything being presented at the public here yeah that's typically how it worked there was a lot of back and forth yes prior to the public hearing you're still like a hybrid of the two that i just the picture that i just painted but more more of the talk now it depended on the town manager and their philosophy but for the most part the managers that i worked with were very open and honest and they gave the direction that the council in general was looking for and then we would have to try to work within those parameters thank you i guess that's what we're asking them to do their needs and keep their this is what you have to spend and break it up the way you want what's this yeah rewarded yes yeah so the only thing i was going to add to that was as far as going back to getting together was not necessarily making it more official but i know that they have just as an example of viewers the arresting agency on aging or the president it's kind of also the chamber of commerce for something the chamber of commerce is going to be communities will and saying hey what can we do just like you were talking about shared services so i don't know if it needs to be like shared services council given some i'm not saying that these have an official name but that made least everybody in the community has the ability to have input on it it may be that caswell wants to come in we need to open it up to everybody not just specific uh towns or cities that you're looking at if we have blood for everybody they may have input to help they're getting it accomplished that we may be able to take and modify for us my vision was to start with two or three communities okay work up the camps without the bodies get they they bought their way in i don't i was told the numbers once it was staggering but you know they walked early so now we've got four central uh rooster communities participating in that model and it was this year seeing the benefits of doing anything absolutely and i think if you're trying to sell something i mean the logical starting points for us are livestock style okay the neighbors we interact more easton is logical also it's another neighbor of ours but if you go and talk with them and you're presenting to them a model like rooster waste solutions they're already there they already know it works you know can we take that model can we apply it to whatever other else so i don't know if that needs to go to the castle's motion saying hey we would recommend the chief so i said well absolutely yeah i think you'd have to have their condition well support yes okay we don't have round one direction from them yet right no right no i think we've got a whole path of this though so it may be just the same thing well personally council doesn't want to give us direction let's set our own that's my that's that's my attitude you know make sure we pick something that can work let's not bite off something that is going to be so monumental that it cannot be made to succeed take little steps well i i i'd caution you on that perspective of trying to reach out to another community of selectmen counselors management without direct support of our council and management because you'd fall in your face quickly okay the door would be might not even open okay so i mean i think you need that we need to have that conversation with the council and and see if they would entertain us uh taking an active role in those projects such as that but i think before you go out like that you've got to have their support and blessing right you'll also need your department manager right you know you need to go out there and say what he's got you know you're going to need the town managers to work together yeah you know so yeah it's going to be a multitude of people not just that's right the seven of us has taken the time or looked at what is going on with ambulance slash fire departments statewide in other words what are other departments doing what is their full-time versus part-time what are the costs for their departments has has anybody done like any type of comparisons or tried to dig into that to kind of get comparison information other than we've we've had a lot of talk about cost per capita obviously yeah and that's ours compared to other communities up here in the county but i'm curious to see state that's all over all that at this point right and we don't know how those numbers came no we don't know if there were expenses and revenue figured into that or if it was just flat numbers we don't know the basis of those numbers so i started to nobody has really looked into that to try to get we haven't started comparisons to see what that is we've had our discussion i haven't gotten far yet yeah i have a foot in the door if we want to look at madawaska's kind of ems system because they have the frenchville and senegal yeah that they feed out too so it'd be similar to like a law i'm still in the you know easting kind of branching out um i can definitely approach eric and see how his you know they've they just bought a brand new one here this fall 2021 brand new so obviously something's going good there we don't know but maybe not but no eric has his own department and then it's gym with yes so it's separate departments yeah it was an article about regionalizing in many parts of maine that they could operate something recently through the last month there's no question it's got to be a broader population than what we have to keep it substantive you know sustain it uh with our population but we have a lot to offer we have a lot to offer we don't we do we have good equipment we have a good crew we have trained fully personnel is awesome but yeah we do need to bring in some others to survive without wine so the preschool can survive without easton we can just get them on board with us when it comes to staffing that's your issue i've seen both sides i'm a first responder i mean mars hill has marcel blyton and bridgewater yeah so that may equal four grand all together they survived full-time staff 24 hours a day a week and they've just enabled service yeah southern rustic just at the same exact thing and they're surviving they got three or four amps i believe and they got stabbed all the time [Music] to house the ambulance and marcel has some of the past ems just wish we could steal one but those are standalone services right without the fire department being connected i know for a fact that mars hill will start on five hundred thousand dollar budget two ambulances full-time staff building so so i can build crap i mean if it's if it's something you guys want me i mean i can easily email eric and at least get a model of his budget and see like percentage where he puts things you know if they're willing to share then you know i think of them you know i don't think of caribou and limestone i think going back up like kevin says back up home but where they have those branches of those other you know what i mean i want to know what the agreement is and how he budgets it and whatnot and i think eric would be willing to at least maybe not provide the full numbers but at least say this is how we did it any information i think from a budding i mean nobody wants to see anybody fail so i'm assuming other towns would want to help other towns especially where maybe there's no competition but i i know for a fact limestone limestone's cost is a hundred dollars ahead right now that's their issue yeah okay they're happy with what they have at a hundred dollars ahead you want to talk with him that's the ballpark you need for the end so there was caribou right now you and i wouldn't do anything different all right so but what is our cost per head and if it doesn't match that's the problem we're going to charge our own town double that and then we're going to go out for a new business and charge him a hundred dollars ahead when it's costing us 200 230 like that that's the problem right now that's where we're not going to get regionalized because our cost is too high i foresee that definitely like the first year or two hopefully eventually ems would pick up you know what i knew where there would be enough business and then that would i would hope taper down you know as revenue starts coming up right i'd like to see that model yeah over the years kind of start you know leveling out yeah yeah we definitely need a lot more information yeah and i mean it's still relatively i'll say new it's still it's still you know in its infancy so we haven't seen it right you know i think i i mean i don't know details or anything but i'm not completely sure that carol was as stable and secure as we all think they are with with their services so yeah that's just i have no clue if any of that is accurate but i know that i've heard it in a couple of different directions right and if they're not you know certain in themselves then it's going to open up limestone we're basing our numbers on a couple of years ago yeah yeah it's not current data so i don't know what the difference is but i know there's been some changes there there's a new chief there's new great there's been some different staffing issues changes scarable has their annual report online so you can actually look and see what their their year-end accounting statement is you can take a look at those revenue and expense numbers for the fire and ambulance and look at that that information is online it might be one year out but i know i know that it seemed as though it was in that hundred dollar per capita because they were servicing a lot of other smaller communities yeah they were also part of that plus they have a hospital over there and they're able to do transfers which is where a lot of money is with ambulances if you look at their numbers overall you're going to find that when you run the numbers on careful they're going to they're going to be very close to that 100 per capita figure and the information is on their website okay anything else like i said we can work together on the wording to put together a motion next tuesday uh keeping back to your minds of suggestions for better ways to do things and and ways to raise revenues you know so we can you know just give them some bullets on the page of things to consider and think about the council the special meeting with the town council june 9 4 p.m in public is welcome great i'm going to take them off now i'm assuming here yeah where's my notes on that okay hi my name is ian hall and i had two suggestions for budget okay um that i wanted to run by you sure um i'm not picking on anyone but the library uh requested to add a position due to clubs and entities wanting to use the room downstairs um so they wanted to add a position i worked for a program a4 td and it is for individuals 55 and older um it is they pay the wages for you to work so um i worked from december 2017 for jim reisner until march of 2019 and i'm to do clerical work and it's no cost so sometimes looking outside the box for to hire just a body to be there can reach out acap where i currently work has a workforce development program so people are looking for jobs they also pay the wages so sometimes when adding a position also for public works for lawn mowing or learning how to do that there are agencies that we can look at that would come in pay the wages and it wouldn't go to the town and the other thing that i wanted to look at was this is all throughout one of the programs the development is through a cap it's a federal program that i am working for it's called a4td associates for training and development so you have mature workers they can work at the library they're given a certain amount of hours no cost to the town and i'm sure there's other agencies out there that when you're looking for just demand a building you know wreck department lifeguards rec room that type of thing it cuts down on payroll yeah absolutely and the other idea that years ago fire department used to have a committee a wife's club they used to do raffles something like a request for air packs they could do car washes raffles and instead to raise the money and i think we've gone away from that yeah we we had a discussion this community i think is two weeks ago on that line uh you know washing vehicles and little things to help their own departments and every little bit helps right yeah so to get a little extra so those are two ideas that i had okay thank you for sharing yeah that's a good point going back up north all the fire departments do a chicken barbecue yeah and i mean you're talking thousands of dollars yes they get that i've been to them and you know what you donate half of the income to a senior class for the project grad so i mean yes okay you split the income but you get a whole bunch of kids that come and help at four o'clock in the morning sucks but you know try being there every time you know but that's that's just something i mean and that's matawasana i mean i don't know what seneca then you're in all of those i mean they all do santa again santa got this one french villa what those ones four kent just had theirs last week right now do you know who the contact is the regional director for the afford still the i can get back to you yeah it's still the same person okay it was a gentleman right yes okay okay yeah that idea is a lot like shared shared jobs and stuff that's it's a lot it's similar well but they're all helpful things we should be thinking about yeah right i mean it isn't going to raise millions of dollars but it could make debt you know at twenty thousand dollars for a part-time person if a catch will need to take the bill and send us someone an a4 td is looking for placements they're very unsure it has to be a non-profit but the town government and once a library goes through it would be perfect and they cover all insurances like liability everything for that employee so yeah so if something happens yeah they cover all of that i do believe they can't be unsupervised but that and put them on the off hours where the super body is not there to be alone and then put the the egg cap worker or whatever during the day with the library that's a very good one i think looking forward to the joint meeting with the council do you have any other publications any kind of challenge is is i'm still looking for guidance i'm old enough so i can't filter all that stuff out anymore so just asking kind of to be placed on the agenda to further specify what they want from us so they'd have time to think of it right we can provide that to andrea as soon as possible and then she can put it on yeah that's the three the town uses but we can add more [Music] requests yes well and shane made a post yesterday and i saw that and a lot of people saw that and i think that's why there's some turnout tonight so yeah that's a good use of shane's facebook right now everybody's [Laughter] amen,True

looking at public comment period if anybody would like to get out to the podium state your name and uh hi i'm billy joe sharp of course [Music] i have some written written comments here i hope i can keep them in line so i was recently appointed to serve on the newly formed budget advisory committee we first met on may 12th and had what seemed like a very productive well-communicated meeting there were a few members of the community president along with the councillor and some good discussions came from this meeting we at least found a starting point the second meeting was held last night may 17th a few more citizens came and still a counselor as well it is my experience as a former town employee with knowledge of how meetings are to be held in conduct and such i was very frustrated after last night's meeting as the dialogue changed quickly from having a recommendation for council it's more of a trying to make demands onto the council it was my understanding that we were acting advisory and would only try to come up with ideas to share with the council what it quickly became was a town meeting and what it did was take the focus and attention office advisory committee and shipped it to the public in attendance and it became a back and forth unproductive two-hour meeting and it's you know don't get me wrong it's nice when a member of the public can ask a question when they don't understand a term a statement or didn't hear something correctly there's no problem you're here to understand and learn what isn't nice is when the member or members get loud argumentative and disrespectful to a member of the committee present or other town officials there was too much this is what needs to be done or else don't pass the budget there is inappropriate discussion started about the contract of the town manager and this began a very heated discussion until i had to speak up very forcefully and stop that discussion from happening it is not appropriate nor is it legal to have discussions about town employees in the capacity that this committee is serving now while i thought after the first meeting that maybe this committee could be objective and come up with some fair and just ideas because that was discussed openly but after last night i feel that the committee majority has become too involved with a group of citizens that are interjecting a lot of negativity and factless claims onto it and can't offer objective fair and just recommendations the bully and bullying mentality on the bully and bullying on the playground mentality of some of our citizens has got to stop as a former town employee i can attest to this abuse we have withstood for almost a year from certain citizens do you all not realize that this is not right not acceptable or do you think that it is acceptable the arguing back and forth and interruptions during these meetings have got to stop it's time to conduct these meetings properly and keep the control so i asked the town council tonight to come up with a code of conduct for all town meetings we are a town council form of government and have a charter and we need to follow those rules i was hoping to be able to have a positive impact with this newly formed budget advisory committee but last night proved to me that rules and laws were broken and i want people and staff to know that i do not share all the views of this majority of this committee and rather than waste my energy competing with them and the public that attends these meetings i will resign and focus my attention on the staff and departments of this town that have been beaten down to feel useless and unwanted i will work to help you their voice so tonight i do officially resign from a budget advisory committee thank you thank you i wasn't going to speak tonight but um i'm not going to go into what i wanted to say all i want to say is when you're going over the budget realize that the department heads in this town have come in under budget the last few years which i say that speaks a lot for them so think of that when you're going over your budget for them thanks thank you tammy i don't normally do this i have to come here and speak on behalf of billy joe uh you know for the last year or so she's been coming home stressed crying going on about a lot of things have been said now taxes they take the brunt of the front office taxes going out she was in the review for slander many of things untrue she's one of i think and i've heard a lot from other townspeople that she was one of the best uh clerks that we had she loved her job loved it she come home every night pulling her hair out you know ever since this tax uh new tax they come out for the portland come up and reevaluate them uh you know it's been downhill from there she tried she she did the best job she could for the town she worked towards doing the best job she could but she got so much slack from the other side she had to quit got a job at defense she tried this committee thinking that maybe it'd be just a little bit different same story same people yelling done with their lungs trying to change things in this town blaming the town manager over here we've got a town officials that approve everything that goes on in this town but we're going to blame the woman same reason why they're blaming billy joe maybe for certain things that's what i'm sick of i've heard it now for a year and a half so i told billy joel she didn't think i'd do it come down here at least speak a little bit on her behalf that there's no voice for a woman in this town right they're being smothered and i've heard i've watched the town meetings i hear them they're loud they're obnoxious they think they got the truth they got you know they throw out all these uh i know this i know that there's no question about it and i've heard andrea on the watching it from home right she says you know you can't go buy that you can't go by the she knows what she's doing i don't believe they do there's there's you know there's a lot of things that you know that the town manager has to deal with all the different departments keep them under budget blah blah blah there's a lot to do right one person two people want to stand up here and say you're not doing your job right i'm just wondering if she was a man it could be different because a lot of women in this town can't take it anymore they're being overrided jim i hate to pull pin you out on this but to start it with that right you and your wife going around the petition putting billy joe on the paper how do you think that made her feel you pissed me off i wanted to make it i wanted to come up to you and talk to you about it good friend of my father right you want to cut the ems out my father lives across the street over here he would have been dead if we have ems hadn't been over there as soon as they were he would have been dead he had no breath left in him when he called his heart was 911 the bare back bottom and nothing left you'd have been dead there's no question the vms hadn't been there in five minutes they put the air oxygen to them revive them your best friend you want to count all these programs you got all the answers right you slandered billy jones in the paper you got all the answers you took names that were on that petition and you put them on a different date because what you were doing before it even happened before they approved it the council you had already gone around and put a bunch of names on this petition you had and then when you found out you you can't do until after you just copied and pasted or whatever you did to another petition and then you blamed her she went to school she took all the courses that she had to do to do her job do it 100 but you come in and corrupt the whole thing she was only telling you how to do your job how you should do it but instead what you do you slander in the paper what do you think that did to her i heard it every night it's not right you people you don't do it the way the law is you want it you use your your manhood or whatever it is right to get get your point across say using any of the laws that are there that's what they do that's what andrea does she hasn't done one thing in this town that these people haven't approved whoever's on the council she suggests she brings the two forward right you guys vote on it does she vote on it who's getting all the slander her billy joe me many women in this town i'm sure they got a heap of if she was a guy i'm certain they're not going to stand up to him i'm certain of it [Applause] anybody else uh we'll move on to um correspondence and reports license and permits as of may 13 2022 we have received one off-premises catering permit application from northern maine brewing company recommendation is that council allows the town manager to sign a permit for northern maine brewing company and i will die next we'll go to licenses and permits pardon me we just did lessons excuse me one second that's off one i'm sorry uh financial report checking account balances of april 30th 2022 was 171 629.67 and machia is 5 000. excise collected in february was and 55 dollars and thirty nine cents compared to sixty two thousand six hundred sixty four dollars and fifty three cents last year as of april 30th 2022 uncollected real estate taxes for 2021 were 448 816 and 67 compared to last year at 478 149.64 as of april 30th 2022 our revenue was up 2.15 which equals our exp which equals our expenses that were up 3.26 we received april revenue sharing in the amount of forty four thousand five hundred thirty six dollars and sixty nine cents on april twentieth twenty twenty two total revenue sharing received to date is six hundred and forty seven thousand eight hundred and nine dollars and thirty six cents we are at 75.03 versus the budgeted of 83.33 that is down 8.3 from the state equaling 71 359.81 next we'll go to uh aws uh report mr majeski any councils our last meeting was on april 29th since then some of you may or may not be aware we had a fire up on the lead for phil i think monday night maybe tuesday night it was extinguished there wasn't that much damage there was no damage to the line it was up on top of the hill but cause i think the spontaneous combustion was caused called in by the state police at 2 30 in one and we get help from many municipalities to bring things out there i just wanted to bring the council's attention in and i know our assistant chief knows now that we are set up out there with a dry hydrant um and i wonder why the trucks were shuttling back and forth to town to get water i don't think that they were aware of that so um olympia was working on bringing a program to work with our fire department to make them aware of what we have out there for availability and possibly talking to the town about uh putting a pump on that dry hydrant through the landfill maybe there's some cbg funding that we can use for that um to make sure we have a pump right there in case a fire truck gets there that doesn't have a pump capability because they were coming into town you supply hydrogens our finances at the time of our meeting for the end of march we were ahead of schedule by uh five percent i had a budget um we are for we because of code we haven't had a halls meeting we used to meet with the halls once a year to go over what's going to happen in the next year or so it's really just a place to sit down and have a dinner and discuss some of the issues that they may have come and going to the landfill we specifically want to target that we know within a year so the things that prescott are going to be changing that's going to be the first week of june um and any of the councils everybody to come to that if they'd like to it shows you a pretty short reading but it allows it allows the halls testament but what's going on it allows us to give them some suggestions on what to make things work better for them we received bids for our bulldozers there's only two companies in the state of maine that offer bulldozers that are that are capable of running on the landfills uh good example is the fact that we used to have windows to help suppress the fire there's different shields and stuff that we put in those bulldozers um mark to a recommendation from the boards going back to see what it would cost us to have a service contract included in the bid so as soon as we get something back from that we'll have a better idea on the actual expense of the bullets um we have a new position that we're contemplating opening up at the landfill for um an operations manager we know that uh mark has given us a tentative resignation date in the future and we're trying to make sure that we're all aligned for a change over and out it's going to happen and the board suggested that mark look into this operations management first to to look at how that might help fill the void so we're still in some discussions as to how that's going to work out the description people have saw that back from mark and we're moving ahead with our engineering company on the constructions of cells five and six we're about a year ahead of time for doing construction stuff but with all the construction that's being done in arizona county we feel if we don't get a contractor on the boat pretty soon we may miss that window for next year and that could cost us a lot of aggravation with where we put stuff if the cell's not built so we're trying to stay on top of that any questions i could answer um again i'd like to thank the forefather fire department and the municipalities that came to help with that was there any damage any equipment no no no no we're quite fortunate that um it was up on top of the hill not down by those throughout the cells and we don't we because we've got dishes in the past we don't leave our equipment up on the hill and nothing wrong because you you know you just know it make sure you don't tell around there but and we're also looking at um the potential for dp letting us use leachate for the extinguishing device and maybe keeping our pawns high enough that we could pump out of them if we could and we know the five departments don't want to run into the trucks so it's another reason for us to look for a portable pump that we would like to try to get so if we can't be more information on that we'll get back to you i don't know if mark's talking about that yet or not thank you guys very much appreciate it thank you steve next we got the facial year 2223 budget public hearing update and the first order will be the minutes from the first meeting of april 28 2022 i'll make a motion we approve the minutes from the april 28 2022 uh first public budget hearing second second that function in a second any discussion i would like to take a minute to just let the committee know i know there's going to be some learning curves that i do know i've been serving on a council in our municipality off and on for many years and i'm still learning and i don't expect everybody that is on the committee who's going to pick up and run with this and there's there's a lot of tension not just in our community in every community right now with all the budgets that all the other communities are working with i can say i did take time and review the meeting online and i i would like to hope to think that everybody can can uh get the kinks out of what we're doing uh like i say i know i know this isn't gonna take off running like a weld oil machine everybody's got ideas and i think there's there's gonna be some mistakes made along with making mistakes if we realize that and we can we can admit it learn from it and move forward that was a whole idea behind this committee uh i i do want everybody to know that after listening to the meeting i realized there were some hiccups and i just hope that working forward we can we can get through them and gain ground with it i think there is some opportunities in it i i do i think that used for the right reasons we can gain some good information from the committee to us but we're all on the same team here and we got to work together um and like i said i know there's going to be some uh there's there's going to be some mistakes made uh that's just that's makes us human uh and we'll get through them but we got to focus on the reasons that we're there and i would like to see uh you know the up and coming meetings that we can gain some valuable opportunities to gain some information and i at this point feel really uh mad that billy joe uh is at this point stepping down if there's a reconsideration i i would be open for it um i like it like i said i can't emphasize enough i know going into this there was going to be some bumps hopefully no bruises that's for sure but i um i just uh i apologize uh greatly to you and anybody else that might have been affected by some things that might have might have got off track but hopefully we can learn from them and move forward and so i that's where i'm at with it so i just want to say i apologize sincerely mr chair i would just like to the question obviously there was one counselor at the meeting uh i didn't know there was a meeting going on so i don't know how the public or something to know that meeting going on and and you know because i would love to bend at the meeting unless then you know we're all supposed to be working together i think that uh i don't know how this the budget committee worked out or how how this deal worked out but uh obviously that there's people from the public that found out about this meeting and wasn't able to voice their opinions i knew about the meeting but i was told that uh counselors shouldn't shouldn't be at those meetings because of the conflict of interest that's what i was told by anybody i didn't realize we were able to go either but was there a council at the meeting yes are we supposed to be at the meeting it's a conflict of interest okay i have a answer from the mma lawyer that says he read the ordinance and he says the counselors are perfectly willing to go as a citizen you reached out to an mma legal sir on your own behalf okay well since it's been brought up um i guess i just i've sat quiet for a really long time a really long time and i'm if you're sure yes like the point of order you had emotion on the floor you had a second on the floor and then you began a discussion on a side topic which is not on the top on the table at this time i would like to hear the vote to approve or deny the minutes please tony is right well we have a discussion though well we're in discussion yes but we've got to solve the minutes so what i was going to say is as far as the way that the budget committee and things like that have been going i do feel like there has been a lot of counterproductive behavior by some citizens again i didn't go to the meeting so i don't know who i don't know what was said i have no idea at this point i'll have to go back and watch it but i am really really disappointed that um we are losing billy joe on that committee because i know all of the work that she did for the town and i know how well she understands the budget and i know that she invested a lot of time and energy into this town so i'm really really excited it was serious yeah and i i think that um you know what was said about females and being bullied and i don't care if it's because you're female or not i mean to me that's irrelevant i just think that it's ridiculous and we shouldn't be treating each other like that in general i mean we're all adults we can accomplish a goal without having to be name-calling and and i think we're losing sight of the actual budget itself by doing all of this so this committee's advisory but i hope that we're still working on the budget as a council is really all i want to put into that if that's it we'll uh go for the next speaker on the um budget is mr bouchard with the budget advisory committee uh the chair of the budget advisory committee mr jason vice was unavailable for this evening so we should be sure to speak with you i don't have a formal presentation no it's okay but we provided his powers with materials from our meetings which should have been distributed to more of a question and answer thing from you know the one thing one of the things the committee would like from the council is a little bit more direction on what you would like from the committee we we had to do a little bit of guessing as to what exactly our role was you know we looked at the ordinance you looked at the feedback that was generated from the public at the two budget hearings it kind of just weighed it you know you know i i thought the conversations and the proceedings were reasonably productive um our focus was was just on the global picture because from our perspective we're looking that we had basically five weeks from when the committee's first meeting was until the time that you folks have to vote on the budget so let's we decided not to focus on on like individual departments or individual lions because it just wasn't that enough time in the schedule to do that the other issue is our focus was exclusively well maybe not exclusively primarily on the expense side and speaking personally you need to look at expenses you need to look at income you got to balance the whole thing okay so we were trying to get a lot done in a little bit of time if you have any questions on anything that's in there i'd be more than happy to try and answer them for you and like i say if council has something more specific like we'd like you to address abc we'll gladly do that well i think it's a learning curve yeah unless he wants to do 120 hours worth of work into yeah to the question of meetings our perception is there's a lot to do between now and your next meeting the meet we've scheduled ourselves every tuesday at six o'clock for meetings um i'm not sure about how the initial meeting was publicized uh but at our first meeting like all your council meetings are posted i think two or three places in town something like that three places three places okay we tried to to follow that same methodology one of the things i'm going to ask tuesday night is if we put a posting one person for every meeting that we're going to have until you're open so that people know it and then we did not discuss that amongst the committee this is kevin asking you is there a spot that can be generated on the town's website you would just ask permission from the town manager's office to post to the website and to social media and we can certainly do that for you and because by state statute if you are considering musical official now you need to post your meetings minimum of three days in advance of your meetings um so before every meeting for every tuesday meeting you would need to post in those three spots can we post one notice that has four meanings on it and i can verify that for you sir again i don't know the specifics of what you're wondering my perception as far as notice is concerned is usually it's a minimum requirement for us we have to post every meeting there is no we can't just post from here and you know wednesday but i can find out as the budget advisory committee if that is allowable we will do whatever the rules say we're supposed to check i i'd rather err on the side of putting more information again this is kevin i'd rather err on the side of putting more information out than well you need to know i appreciate your help okay um we're looking at this crazy short window that we're trying to get stuff done thank you um before we move on in the face of the information that was given and moving forward as you had said you want correct information at the fort for building mill and it's mil it's just it's not my l-l you can point your you can point your finger here in that one calculation is incorrect your information is incorrect if you would like corrected information that the committee would like that i would be happy to get that for you um because you're lacking a lot of information in what you've put together here for your what you are showing to council and i would hate for you to have this information i i view that comment as instructed so yeah please okay i will get that for you as well um the last presentation on um budgets is from d.c henderson from port perfect fire last week me the council thank you for letting me speak i am not going to shoot from the tip tonight like i usually do i wrote it down so hopefully it will go okay the fire rescue budget has been a hot topic for the last two years it's created frustration both with members of the town and the department i wanted to take time tonight to touch on a few things that i think are important for you to remember when considering the budget first and most important thing for you to remember is that every member every member of our staff is here because they want to be they are part of our department because they want to help the citizens of the town they are members because they care about what happens in this town they are not here to become millionaires or increase the size of their wallets on the back of the taxpayers all members make an effort daily to go above and beyond and give back to the community excuse me second thing i would like you to remember is that when i was hired as the head of i was hired as the head of the department for a reason my role in the department is to operate the department safely and efficiently i was chosen because my knowledge skills and ability in both fire and ems each year when i sit down to create a budget and that starts before thanksgiving for me i start by considering taxpayers i look at the level of service we provide the taxpayers at a level of service they expect from the department i then go through each line item individually and use the best information i can gather which sometimes is very limited i use this information to come to the lowest possible amount that will allow us to do the job we are expected to do safely and efficiently i do this for every line item including reserves i have to consider long-term needs of the department when considering reserve watts these are line items that have been overlooked for decades we can now see the result of overlooking reserves for decades throughout the year i reference the working budget daily and make sure we are using our funds in the most responsible manner i explain this to you all not to to my own horn but to remind you that i was hired to run the department i was hired to put in the long hours to do the research to find the facts and to be the subject matter expert in fire and ems i am glad that the council and the citizens have an interest in fire and ems and i enjoy answering any questions anybody has about it i enjoy speaking and explaining why we need the things we're asking for and why they are essential to do our job safely and efficient and efficiently know that this budget does not contain any wants it only contains needs if the toilet at your house is broken do you call an electrician if your car is broken you call a carpenter if you need to build a garage do you call a plumber while all of those people may have knowledge of the tasks you are asking them to do they are not the subject matter expert if you want any of those tasks completed in the most cost effective and efficient manner you consult the expert in that field i appreciate all the time and energy everyone has put into this budget as you move forward with the decision making process please keep these points in mind thank you thank you [Applause] okay next old business update on tax acquired properties and the following property was put out for bid with a minimum bid of 1500 bid closing was march 30th 2022 at 12 noon bids were

subsection 506 discussion for several years the town has offered a tax club so that taxpayers can pay their taxes in 12 monthly payments payments are made from july to june and are due on or before the 10th of each month the town commits taxes on october 1st so payment of any taxes prior to that date is a prepayment based on information i have received from maine municipal associations legal services the town council needs to approve prepayment authority each year and that prepayment is only for the next annual tax commitment not for multiple future tax commitments the tax collector is recommending that council authorizes the tax collector to establish a tax club for the 2022-2023 tax commitment god next we got proclamation 53 uh anniversary of municipal clerk week background the international institute of municipal clerks iimc initiated the municipal clerk's week back in 1969 to celebrate the contributions of municipal clerks in local government our profession is one of the oldest documented roles in government the proclamation attached proclaims the week of may 2nd 2022 through may 6 2022 as municipal clerks week throughout the town of fort fairfield and give special thanks and recognition to the contributions of the municipal clerk in local government recommendation is that town council signed proclamation 22-05 municipal clerks week i make a motion we sign proclamation 2205. we have a motion in a second hello melissa hi mick kevin hi jim next we got uh nmdc membership board appointments nmdc will be holding their annual election meeting in june of 2022 for the election of executive board members whose terms are expiring in 2024. the executive board is elected from the nmdc membership the appointments last year were mitch butler counselor andrea powers town manager recommendation is that council votes to approve the above mentioned names for the nmdc membership board appointments so moved next we got the tan katana trust company background as is customary in the past to aid the town with cash flow in anticipation of tax revenue for the fiscal year a tan has been voted on and approved by council at council meetings the request for next year's tan 1 million is prior to our tax commitment for better cash flow until tax payments begin obtain a short-term obligation of a municipal government to finance current expenditures pending receipt of expected tax payments the tan debt evens out the cash flow and is repaid at the end of the fiscal year once tax revenues are received the recommendation is that the town council authorized the council chair and the town managers to sign for the fiscal year 2022 2023 tan with katahdin trust company at three point one two percent at one million dollars is there any reason why you didn't research aws we got it two years in a row and it was voted on by the board members that we have to allow the other communities to um have their turn uh with aws aws there's more there's more communities involved with aws and we have to come out on their turns um and it only was offered to the communities if it was beneficial to the members um but the interest rates have skyrocketed so it's really it's not as beneficial as it was last year it was extremely beneficial for us last year we saved a lot of money so we need a motion i move that the town council will authorize the council chair the town manager to sign the fiscal year 2022 2023-10 with the trust at three point one two percent for a million dollars and that would be issued after july first 2022 it can only be issued afterwards got a motion in a second melissa hi man jim hi kevin hi and i will die next we got uh fourth fairfield frontier atv club 19 ordinance council meeting both president of the frontier atv club

chair i'd like to introduce atv ordinance 2204 i second that motion we had a motion in a second any discussion we'll go for both melissa hi mitch all right kevin hi jim hi an eyeball guy uh next we got the spirit of america award nomination for fairfield jmg the spirit of america foundation was established in maine to encourage volunteerism and the commendable community service since the first spirit of america foundation award was presented in 1991 to alma jones by investors mayor over 500 spirit of america ceremonies have taken place the spirit of america award is presented to a local person or person project or group for outstanding community service using fort fairfield criteria to honor the recipient for recipients spirit america foundation is a 501c3 public charity established in augusta maine in 1990 to honor volunteerism the fort fairfield middle high school jmg program has been exemplary in their community building efforts for over a decade the recommendation is that council votes to approve the spirit of america award nomination to the fort fairfield middle high school jmg program so move get a motion in a second we'll vote melissa hi mitch hi jim hi kevin yeah hi and i voted uh next we got allen's environmental usa ce inspection the usace just for reference for council is the united states army corps of engineers the fort bearville dike is under the levee safety program with usa in order to pay to stay in the program we must meet certain inspection requirements at the 1 5 and 10 year inspections this year is an extensive inspection that must be conducted in order to remain in the program the closest company that can provide the inspection and the certification is alan's environmental the next closest company is in lisbon falls then new york state allen's environmental will be able to perform the inspection before eustace's arrival this year attached to this memo is the quote from allen's environmental for twenty six thousand three hundred dollars the recommendation is that council votes to allow the town manager to use g one three zero one zero zero zero admin reserves to pay twenty six thousand three hundred dollars to allen's environmental for the inspection of the fort fairfield dike what's that involved we have to make it thank you i understand i understand that but uh maybe maybe darren can answer this question is that is that you have to make a motion yeah she can explain the procedures we have to dare to cancel so what what this will be is video inspection of basically around 3000 feet of underground pipe um close to 500 feet of it will be done by a submarine with sonar it's uh the pipe is called a pressure conduit it's under water all the time you can't put a dive ring um allen's environmentalists had to buy specialized equipment for this so those are the lines from the river into the gate into the gate and then from the pump in that area so there are four lines that go from the river in to the landsat side and uh that then there are uh there are lines that run the length of the dike at their toe drains so is that is that one year for how long is that going to be good for no one thing that we've looked into counselor is that if we can get this uh certain certification this will be good for for 10 years so if you think about that way it's 2600 a year to provide us insurance from the army corps of engineers if something happens to our dike and it fails without this we'll be on our own we're responsible for full gotcha okay and i believe with this after ten thousand dollars i'm sorry i just didn't know anything about it so i just yeah yeah yeah this is the time it's it's a necessary thing so we do a yearly inspection with them also but this is we're at that point where we have to do this very extensive inspection and we thought we had it last year and then their engineers um have informed us this winter that it's not uh good enough we have to have more extensive inspection not everything was completed so the setup now that we'll it'll be all done the right way at this time correct because we made sure we got their specifications from them and signed off by them i've been involved with this for seven years and we've been working towards the goal that if you vote yes tonight we will have achieved that goal we won't have to even wait until the videoing is done um they will put us in a program and we will [Music] thank you thank you any more questions thank you thank you so we had a motion and a second and discussion we'll go to vote melissa hi mitch hi jim hi kevin hi and i vote next we got the minutes of april 13 2020 in our regular council meeting chair i'll make a motion approve the meetings of april 13th regular council meeting second we had gonna motion in a second uh we'll vote melissa mitch all right kevin jim and i bow die next we got warrants number 21 22 23. i'll read all three words word number 21 in the amount of 412 492.53 was completed on april 11th 2022 they've been checking account balance at 164 288 and 24 cents please noteboard number 21 included the payment to sag number 20 and the amount of 178 532 dollars and nine cents warrant number 22 in the amount of 173 288.90 was completed on april 26 2022 leaving checking account balance at 110 261.65 warrant number 23 in the amount of 194 571.22 was completed on may 9th 2022 leading the checking account balance at 50 413.85 we had a motion melissa hi mitch all right kevin hi jim hi anne [Music] next uh we got other we have actually quite a few things listed under others and i see that uh here also so i was just going to brief you on but i don't know if you have something you wanted to share as well i noticed you had your maps out earlier so i didn't know if there was more that you wanted to do than what i was going to share with them but i don't know i don't know what you're going to share with them the international trade center has grants available to businesses who work in international trade which k-power does they they deal with other countries and because of that they can apply for specific grants and so i was going to ask council's permission to work with them and k pal to try to get the grant money to purchase the land at um changework because you had made the um designation last year that you would like each acre at 18.5 so if we can work with them to get them what they need i think that would be very beneficial to the construction partner of their manufacturers the governor's office also is very interested in businesses that are doing manufacturing as well so there are other projects and programs that i'm going to research for them to get them to what they need how long a process do you think as the wheel turns i move at the speed of municipal government so i can only do what right as far as answers that i received back do you have a timetable sir um yesterday i don't have a timetable yet um there's so much in the works at the moment that it's i can also work with so as far as as looking at what you have for a vision of operation is is it like immediate well it could without opening up that without me having that discussion with the owner i know he's made reference to the possibility of needing to do something you know as soon as this summer so okay but you know everything is it's just really moving timeline but it's not impossible it's not impossible i have a plan if i can speak yeah in the past when i've dealt with a town and i know others have dealt with other towns but when towns had property this town offered me a deal i'm no longer involved with them at all i mean they have the name but that's that's it i'm no longer involved so i'd like to speak uh this town offered me a 26 acres across my shop 12 14 years ago to develop to build a development out there i got involved in some other stuff so it didn't happen they were going to need that property to me and i had three years ago three years to develop it if i didn't develop in three years the town got it back simple but it didn't happen but i know they've offered deals like that in the past to others and these guys want to build they want to put people to work if they end up this property it becomes taxable property and they build on it and just it's better all the way around i i for one as a councilman don't want to hinder these guys in any way at all how about i put a packet together of a proposal of what would be beneficial for the business as well as the community um and have council take a look at that and then uh forward that onto the main international trade center and see what they can do to help us i just want to make sure that they're aware that we're willing to do whatever we can to make it possible for you guys i i understand that i'm we're as far as as far as we are as far as we are concerned i mean i don't want to create the wrong impression but with everything we've got going on right now for us to put time and resources towards you know developing grant you know in writing them number one i've never written one before don't have a clue so i don't know what's involved in it or the time consumption that it has but i can tell you i don't have time to write a grant uh we're just everything is is moving pretty fast and and the seasons are short term we're just short staffed at the moment as well so so any any uh obstructions in your way other than this would stop you to start breaking ground if you could say in the next two weeks is it is it that quick that you guys are i don't i don't foresee us breaking down within two weeks if that's what you're asking all right so what i don't want to see i i just don't want to lose the opportunity if if you guys have a idea of an offer or what you need to move forward that's all we need that's all we need i i i know there's grants and i know you're probably looking at one of the best persons to help you on a grant than the town manager is yeah and she's she's almost got a magic wand well but i i looked in you know i talked with the folks over at mdc uh a while back you know about the possibility of grant money as far as either purchasing land and buying equipment because the amount of equipment that we're going to need when this is all said and done it's you know it's upwards of a million dollars so uh you know it's money's hard for everybody yeah um it's but when i talked with nnbc they just said this as far as they were concerned there's literally nothing right now right so i i kind of gave up on that whole idea yeah most of most of what they do is tight experience and things like that so um they wouldn't have access to them in the national trade service so has there been any type of an offer at this point on the lane you're still in discussion well we had not made any offers because the question we actually if you remember pose the questions with them what can you offer what can you do to help us understanding that you know money's tight and we're having to come up with a lot ourselves to do what we want to do and if we put up another building that's going to be an extreme cause so we would be totally appreciative of anything that the town could do to help us out towards expansion towards putting people to work towards creating more tax infrastructure for you folks i mean it's a it's a win-win for everybody as far as that goal that's right you know so i just you know we didn't know what was available or what you could do don't know how hard your hands are tied or like or you know what you're able to that stops us from motioning kevin just mentioned offering speedy eye that piece of property for a dollar for three years with the understanding that you build on it within the next three years and if you don't then it reverts back to the down what is the um like the footprint of this property what is the amount of land that we're talking about like this i don't know exactly i mean i went on an app on my phone we might want to clarify that it's roughly it's roughly two and a half acres all together all three parcels do we know what the value of it is currently um council voted at valuation of industrial acreage at eighteen five per acre so what should we need here tonight well if you would like me to continue to pursue discussions with the maine international trade center nytc i would need your permission to do that sure i'll make that recommendation i'll second it but i also think that we need to um look outside of that as well because if that's not something that they're interested in doing then there's no reason for us to correct and that's why i also stated that council would let me put together a proposal with the time attorney yes just to have everything in front of us whether we decide to do a dollar or a bigger amount or you know funding but we should have all the information before making this decision but we need to do it quickly because i don't want you guys to have to be waiting on us so the sooner the better we can move forward on uh on our legal side to have it ready either way for them to move forward that's right so i recommend that we have this together within the next two weeks is that a reasonable time frame that would be reasonable for you guys within two weeks time period folks getting together again in two weeks we will in order to do this we'll put a special council meeting together yep melissa hi mitch hi jim hi kevin hi and i will die next another yep the next one is the um this is from the state of maine department of economic and community development here ms powers the office of community development ocd has reviewed the submitted letter of intent to imply for the 2022 community development block grant cdbg economic development program edp our reviews show that the town of fort fairfield on behalf of tebow farms llc has met the requirements established by title 1 of the housing and community development act of 1973 as amended and the state of maine cdbg program so we are moving forward we are already in the process uh anything else another versant power has a request to provide service to the new solar farm for quicker solar llc that will be at the old reenergy plant location at cheney grove in order to serve them with a voltage needed bursted power needs to upgrade the facilities to accommodate in order to complete the rebuild person power will have company-owned facilities of home town properties the company acquires the right to enter set and maintain the facilities with an easement the attached easements are needed to complete this project also attached to the layout of the work to be completed to assist with the easements the easements relate to wp1 wp2 wp3 wp4 wp5 wp7 and wp9 recommendation is council votes to allow the town manager to sign the easements for power with bursant for fort fairfield solar llc's solar farm do they want to put the substation up there and maintain the substation put the do we have a second sorry got a motion in a second we'll vote melissa hi mitch we have received a request from gateway title to sign a quick claim d prepared by gateway title because a lien reported in june 1967 was never discharged there are no back taxes owed on the property a recommendation is that council members sign the attached foot pain we need a motion i need can i move on for voting the fort fairfield fire rescue is requesting permission to make an offer to the city of hospital e450 ambulance labeled as medic 16. this unit was involved in an accident and they did not get it repaired properly leading to the engine failure they were replacing the ambulance with a new ambulance and are no longer using this vehicle i have worked with director hanson as well as righted ford to get cost estimates to remove the blown engine install a new engine and repair all bodywork that needs to complete on the vehicle needs to be completed on the vehicle the total estimated cost is 19 000 we are requesting that you allow us to make an offer of 800 for the unit and this would come from our current working budget for an all-in total of 19 800 we would have a fully functioning ambulance with a new engine to purchase the same unit with a functioning original engine would be between thirty thousand and forty thousand dollars this would provide us with a third ambulance that would have a significant useful life having a third ambulance would allow fire rescue to work on increasing revenue as we would have the ability to provide long-distance transfers when staff are available currently we are usually unable to send long-distance transfers as it would reduce our ability to cover the emergency calls in our town this used ambulance would be used as a second out ambulance if we were to send another unit under transfer this is a large demand for long-distance travelers there is a large demand for long-distance transfers and this is the only and and this is the only for the department to increase revenue we're going to talk about it okay increase revenue without expanding to cover additional towns we recommend the council allows deputy chief anderson to offer the city of hostile 800 for their 2010 ford e-450 ambulance with the funds to be taken from the fire department's current budget thank you d.c so this is a bid by the way but we need the permission to make a bid on it so this money will be coming out of the point 122 budget and this is the opportunity um council did direct forfeit require rescue to find other ways to bring in their revenue and this is quite honestly as dc has stated many times transfers the largest amount of revenue without having to purchase a brand new ambulance to do that this um supports that the ability [Music] so that's the amount that i have come up with after doing the research that makes it a horrible reasonable class pay half price you know operating engine so what type of um income is available from these long distance transfers like what is the demand for that just today so i wish i hadn't counted the other day but as of two weeks ago we turned down 72 long distance transfers since january first so each transfer again as we talked about last meeting there's three levels that you could charge for what it's empty [Music] so each one depends on what the transfer is but the money is really the moment miles as we discussed the longest to transfer there are many loaded miles on top of your initial charge for whatever level carrier provided so like i said a rough estimate if we account for emt basic calls and our specially care transfers rough estimate a very low estimate is battlefield or new transfer those are just the ones that we've been a bit available by the phone to write down the information on the transfer there's been many that have come in at 2 a.m or while we're at fire scene we've turned out more than that that's what i can tell you for sure are those local transmissions so i know the castle originally said we didn't want to do any transfers i have some local transfers in but i'm sure that we can still cover our emergency problems so the third ambulance would be for long distance transfers and generally ems terms long distance transfers anything out of a losing cap so i have proven staffing available i'll send a crew to do a tammax that holds me or holding the board ken as long as i know they're here and i'm available or another staff member available to first respond if our first ambulance is up our big problem is um i'm sure you've all seen it as soon as one ambulance goes somewhere in town the second ambulance is right behind it we could go a day with no call the next day we'll have six calls within an hour so by sending somebody a long distance transfer takes one of our ambulances over 12 hours and that's we don't my understanding intended to capsule this initial intent was to make sure we had 9-1 coverage for our citizens so getting the third angles will ensure that you do both time and one but also try to get some more money again it's a hot topic i can't make any money any other way than transfers for the department and you can't really do transfers without risking 9-1 coverage to go to the best option that i've been able to find but like i said in the memo that annuals didn't have one engine and that's 147 000 miles it would probably be closer to 40 000 and this is one of the main reasons why we lost our animal service because they want to switch over to just transfer because that's where the money is and this is why we're in the moment so the big difference we talked about medical insurance and pain emergency calls are always highly contested by medical insurance companies they don't want to pay they don't want to argue about what care you provided was really necessary with transfers most of the transfers are pre-approved by the insurance company and they're required every transfer is required to have a medical necessity sheet signed by a doctor saying it's medically necessary so you don't want to argue but it will promote the payment from the insurance company as much as we do and do we have enough staff to do the transfers right the majority of the 70 some transfers we took her down have been because we couldn't safely cover the 911 calls if the transfer was gone because it's so far i again i don't want you to think that i'm giving the impression that we will take every single transfer request we can because that's not accurate i consider every transfer request and make sure we're providing the coverage of the taxpayers need while also trying to think about our bottom line and that's what we discussed when we first started the animal services is to reach out eventually to do some transfers to bring in a little extra revenue because if you can't depend on medicare and medicaid all the time and for diverse purposes the only other way that we would increase our revenue is by working with other cameras and we try that we continue to try that but that's not on us to decide on the other counts that agree it works with us so if you work on that this is the only way that you can positively increase that and i have all the large you guys have approved um all large ticket items that would go in the ambulance so we could still have them for training as our initial purpose but we'd also be able to staff and stop that ambulance um the big cost that was left was just the first monitor so have you looked at you and over inside and out instead of everything that needs to be in it very intimately [Music] so it's it's really the problem is is the engine and there's some minor body work that director hands and i done a good chat and took a look at and it's uh it's still in very easy and still my favorite ambulance even with the balloon can i go guys i know this is appropriate i'd like to go back to what i have before i don't officially speak for the entire budget advisory committee but i'm pretty sure the committee was welcome any counselor's presence to be honest with you at the first meeting in the world wondering why in north carolina we did listen we didn't know all the particulars we just were walking the way the government established the ordinance it doesn't call for council should that be it doesn't call for council to be there i'm just throwing it out if there is a counselor there that i would like to be there as well that if one can go it should be yeah if there's an issue about capacity can you not attend as a private citizen as a municipal official they cannot attend his apprenticeship i know so many counselors you'd have to call a meeting correct they would have to post that they were in attendance okay yeah if that's all another um yeah we really didn't discuss what the budget advisory committee report was sent to us and we were asked to do what i'm based on the recommendation of the budget advisory committee that the council direct the town manager to work with the department heads to revive the budget proposal for physical year 22 23 so that the total expenditures will be covered by a mill rate of not greater than 22 mills um the rate is calculated assuming the property valuations and other unknowns remain at the current amounts of fiscal year 2122 and it represents an increase of 12.5 on the current not to sidetrack but it's almost impossible to set that millwright can't have discussions right okay we have a motion a second so we can have a discussion um the language that is in that is the 22 mil rate is that so if you were to direct me to um with the budgeting 22 mil rate 22 mill rate today versus 22 million in october um when the mill rate is set is not the same numbers this information that is here is incorrect that they used during the time we'll send you the corrected information so um the municipal tax rate calculation standard form is all the information that you need and currently everything from line above line 14 to line one changes between now and october sometimes significantly sometimes not at all um so it to say that you're going to fix a no rate to your budget now and unfortunately our fiscal year does not match up with the state's fiscal year for when they give us these assignments so we have to make projections with all things as i said at the last council meeting with all things staying as they are with no changes the total maximum tax rate allowable by the state is 26.74 not 31.1 which they have given um so their information is not what the state has given us um and again these numbers change uh excessively sometimes especially considering the municipal revenue sharing uh betty homestead veterans tree growth there's a tif there's a lot of things that change our value the total taxable evaluation of real estate does not always stay for our money so that in effect changes what the minimum tax rate and the maximum tax rate is allowable by the state um and then of course council has the courtesy to choose um in between any one of those numbers um when when the time comes in october to set the mill rate but right now and this is just an estimate this is not what the actual final number will be um and i cannot verify that because again we don't have all of the information when is the next budget meeting for the council like june and then and that will be our final meeting before we vote before you vote then we'll have that more accurate information again and october those numbers can change then we'll know what we're going to have for the final number and we can decide if we want to go with this or this or what direction that we feel and again i would also like to since we're on this topic of discussion and discussion has been open to me as well i would just like to remind council and the budget advisory committee that the municipal expenses for this year are more than covered by the municipal income that comes in by three hundred and ninety two thousand ninety eight dollars the excess that you are seeing the two million eighty eight thousand five hundred and forty three dollars comes from msad 20 and a roosted county tax that's important to remember when you come and ask me to lower everything to a minimum 22 million so in our discussion i would just like to say that i think it would be more beneficial if we were to have another working meeting with the department heads instead of force them to try and make numbers match a specific mill rate i think that maybe we could have another working meeting where they come we have additional questions we look a little bit deeper into things instead of doing telling them here's what you're going to do and and we work with them instead of tell them what we want and demand something i mean obviously we want to have a good budget that benefits our citizens that benefits our departments but i don't think we want to tell them what to do we want to work with them in order to to find you know a common ground at least everybody's probably going to have to give and nobody's probably going to like it on either end unfortunately like they're going to have to give a little the taxpayers are going to have to give a little in order to make this budget work that's probably what's going to have to happen we all know how taxes went up last year and we we know the taxpayers aren't going to want that this year so the mill rate actually didn't go up last year the valuations went up because they were over 20 years due so taxes didn't actually go up in effect as far as the mill rate goes and the rate actually went down um so that's important when we're having this discussion to remember that the value your valuation um if that changed significantly it only means that you were not paying your fair share of the tax burden prior to the rebound so that's it that's an important discussion to continue to have because i think that that gets confused a lot when people are talking about well my taxes went up you know a thousand dollars or my taxes went down a thousand dollars i do hear that as well so we have to remember that value your the valuation of your property has a lot to do with how much you pay um the mill rate has to do with the budget and those those are two very different conversations and we should have that again okay there is a motion so uh we to get through this we're going to have to vote on the motion at hand is to uh direct the town manager to change the budget to the fiscal year 2223 budget to a permanent 2020. okay i would like to see this as much as anybody because i i know what my taxes cost me per year um but with the information that we get from the budget committee that they're going to identify some corrections and where we stand from here i i would i would like to let this stay open until we meet at least one more time i think we have to vote on the motion though right so at this time uh we could yes i i the motion that he presented we have to deal with that motion we can't table it unless that was the motion to do at his motion so at this point we'll go for vote on the subject of 22 mills melissa no no hi kevin i have all right i'd like to make a motion that we meet with the department heads in a working meeting and if the budget committee can be involved i think that would be even better the budget advisory committee yes you would like an invitation sent to them as well yes please we will send you the email with the uh date now will that have to be a a scheduled yes sir right okay i was just jumping i didn't want to jump the fire do we have to vote on that yes in order to direct me to melissa okay uh other than others and others that's uh moving on next we have an executive session employer promotional executive session sra four five six eight there's no matters second we had a motion a second all in favor say i i i want to thank everybody for coming tonight,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,LbYU3Lae5aw,Budget Advisory Committee Meeting 5 17 22,,13.0,758.0,2022-05-18T11:28:37Z,none,56,0,0,0,it's all yours this is right and then the last one was a different way of looking at them we haven't talked about that i might be out for lunch so oh okay i'd like to bring this meeting to order it's a 602 17 um uh for the record uh all members are present advisory committee and review the last week's minutes may 12th questions or additions or corrections okay we have a motion to accept those minutes we have a second okay all those in favor all in favor motion carry approve the minutes last week i don't know you have a recommendation on your agenda my question goes to presenting this to the council tomorrow i don't know that we asked anybody to be put on the agenda i think how we approach it is basically providing documentation of our emotion and the form and i would expect that that our emotion that we approve uh would be brought forth on their agenda as part of their discussion i don't think it's necessary for a member to actually present them but if there's a member there if they wanted the question sure okay from that perspective i would be here but i can be in massachusetts should we it'll be provided it should be provided to the town manager should arrive for council for tomorrow night's meeting doesn't need to be on the agenda but they will have the information it doesn't have to be a topic but they can at any time as old business bring it up and discuss it that's right they'll at least have it to review that night okay what you're saying is these minutes will be provided for the counselors they yes now but now that they're they're approved um i would um forward them on to miss powers and miss powers will include them in the counselors packets for tomorrow night is that a secretary can do it no problem just typing in her email and sending it away okay very good all right uh and this is the stuff that we've talked about on the internet yes day speeds old business information accompanying uh our motion to do some explanations of it uh kevin you put that together if you anybody has questions of that or gary david or they're bouncing waiting i'm i'm presuming and i get myself in trouble when i presume sometimes yes are you aware of the motion we made last past last week here we go just shut yesterday in the minutes no those aren't minutes that's stuff kevin's prepared well there are we there are minutes and i don't know if we have extra copies of those but need your major just printed the seven for us yes it's the letter i here anyway part of where i was coming from of that was i was concerned that some people might look at our motion by itself and either read more into it or say where the hell are they coming from or that makes no sense there okay so i wanted to provide with that some of the things that we discussed and some of the today's yes minutes and we can provide as un we can provide as unapproved minutes by well as long as i get them done by theirs we don't have to be if we if we no kevin can present this yeah that's all in the comments and it doesn't have to be minutes no it's just like minutes need to be approved but if we agree to something we want to attach to the motion and we have it in front of us in writing as long as the talent office gets i don't know if you can attach them you can do a motion this this has happened your emotion has happened right yes done yeah right it would have to be a whole new whole new shift discussion notes i if if i was my suggestion would be simply forward your your explanations or your background information of our decision along with it and you know it's it's available for them to read or not you know it's up to them so anyway i sent that out got a little bit of feedback uh for those of you who don't know the griffith farmers in town are friends of mine they rent land from me and one of my deals with my tenants is so i spent a huge chunk of the weekend in the truck that wasn't potatoes to the plant with a crap a lot of time on my hands waiting to get unloaded so you know i threw the idea out let's explain ourselves and i'm thinking holy we're gonna find the time to put this together you know so it just it just all came together not while driving i was just gonna say typing and driving was texting just a lot of people so then i got your email that says keep it short because you're going to lose people at that point four pages yeah that's not well let's condense so i've got both versions there and and certainly if my memory wasn't right or we need to add a subtraction off i think you know in my my opinion uh the longer version read well there's not too much to read and i think it gives a good summary of what he concluded to do last week but i i would go with that and i would simply uh send that along with the minutes and and uh and do what they want with it so attach this to our minutes in just a long version now it won't be part of the official minute but i don't think that's a a question they can answer them it's pretty clear what they are to talk about the only the only david and gary's information last week we also you know we the first two pages so this one this one recommended supporting now so this one here is the long version so this one you turn this page in that page then he did a consolidated version and i requested just me so that's what's going on okay okay do you want to see a copy kevin the only the only kind of comment i would have about this particular one is supporting notes yeah um is this the show on the on the the last sentence of that upper paragraph where it says the committee settled on a goal for the mill rate for the 2022-23 fiscal year of no more than 22 mills which is well that was a starting point for them to work their budgets we knew we would never get to a 22 mill i think that's a little that's what i mean it's making a statement that we're not gonna it's not gonna hold up so you wanna remove i think it'd be rewarded aaron had a nice way of putting it i can't remember how you put it last week well yeah but that reads like we're going to set the mill rate to 22. right now i guess that's how i read it yeah yeah um i think the committee settled on a goal for the for the foreign departments to work their budgets yeah we haven't talked about that i want to talk about um,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,fDHybI1F4RY,Budget Advisory Committee meeting 5 12 22,,142.0,8533.0,2022-05-13T11:57:18Z,none,122,0,0,0,and i'll start playing this and then i will get out of the way it's 22 minutes you can stay i watch this no you shouldn't oh my gosh seconds that's yeah yeah i should get one of those they're handy but then they're activating too sorry guys i have one on the inside so i can watch the cats oh do you do they know they're being watched uh i i think you can talk to them through the inside municipal officials maine's freedom of access act is commonly known as the right to know law the law provides the public with the right to attend and observe most municipal board meetings and with access to most people maine's right to know law is certainly not unique as most u.s states also have an open government or open records law and on the federal level the freedom of information act applies to federal agencies the primary purpose underlying maine's right to know law is to create a more transparent government than to inform the public concerning the actions of government officials and how government decisions are made first we will discuss the portion of the law that applies to meetings before we begin note that during this presentation for convenience we will use the term municipal board to refer to and include any municipal board committee subcommittee commission or panel of members the right to know laws requirements apply to public meetings or what the law calls public proceedings the term public proceeding is defined in statute in relevant part the statute defines a public proceeding as including any meeting of a municipal board consisting of three or more members where any board function affecting the public is transacted mma legal services interprets this to mean that when a forum of a board meets and performs any board business including merely discussing board business then a public proceeding covered by the right to know law has occurred the definition of public proceeding is very broad a public proceeding could inadvertently occur if a quorum of board members were in contact with each other regarding board business via email or phone or in person at times and places outside a public board meeting this could violate the law although the right to know law does not prohibit all communications between board members communications among the core of board members involving board issues or communications that take the place of deliberations that would otherwise occur at a public meeting should be avoided as they may violate the law whenever a public proceeding will occur advance notice to the public is required although the right to know law requires advanced notice of public proceedings it does not provide much detail as to the specific type of notice that must be provided instead the law requires that meeting notice be provided in ample time to allow the public to attend and be distributed in a manner that is reasonably calculated to notify the general public in the jurisdiction certified board this is a flexible standard that allows each board to tailor meeting notice to its own needs and customs for example in addition to posted notice a board might choose to use newsletters websites public access television channels or newspapers to disseminate notice the right to know law also does not specify any particular time period that notice must be issued prior to a board meeting mma legal services recommends that boards strive to provide at least seven days advanced meeting notice for regular recurring meetings held on a particular day and week of the month a standing notice posted on a bulletin board on a website in a newsletter or disseminated via similar means is sufficient for example a meeting notice might indicate that the board meets every second tuesday of each month note that the right to know law sets out minimum notice requirements for public meetings of every type of body where no more specific requirements apply however many statutes particularly land use and licensing statutes require specific methods of notice in certain situations and often impose more stringent notice requirements than would otherwise be required by the right to know law in addition municipal charter coordinates or bylaw provisions may impose greater notice requirements or require specific methods of notice that go beyond those required by the rent to know law if an emergency board meeting is necessary the right to know law requires that meeting notice be provided to local media such as local newspaper or television media whenever practicable the notice must include the time and location of the meeting and must be provided by the same or faster means that was used to notify board members we recommend that the board also provide public notice to the extent possible and again local charters ordinances or board bylaws may impose additional notice requirements for such meetings whenever a public proceeding is held any member of the general public has the right to attend and observe the meeting members of the public also may take notes tape record videotape televise or live broadcast public board meetings provided that their activity does not interfere with orderly conduct of the meeting a person seeking to record or broadcast the public board meeting does not need to ask permission or provide advanced notice to the board however a board may establish reasonable rules governing recording and broadcasting as long as the rules do not defeat the purpose of the right to no law although the public has the right to attend and observe a public proceeding members of the public do not have any right to participate ask questions or provide comments unless the board chooses to allow an opportunity for public comment generally the right to know law intends municipal boards to conduct their business in public however the law recognizes a few situations where a board may discuss certain matters in private these are called executive sessions the right to know law strictly limits the subjects that the board may discuss in executive session to only those matters listed in the law at title 1 main revised statutes section 405 the law also sets up specific procedures for entering the executive session first the board may only enter executive session from a public meeting for which advanced public notice has been provided even if the executive session is the only item on the board's agenda in order to enter executive session a board member must make a motion that includes the subject matter of the executive session and cites the specific subsection of the law authorizing an executive session for that subject matter promotion must be approved in public session by at least three-fifths of the board members present and building and must be reported in the board's meetings executive sessions may only be held before discussions of the subject matter covered by the motion to enter executive sessions board members may not discuss other topics in the executive session in addition any form of board action relating to the matter discussed in the executive session must be voted upon in a public session this slide lists the subjects that may be discussed in executive sessions remember that each subject listed represents a narrow exception to the right to know law's public meeting requirement in addition each subject requires a specific criteria to be met in order for the executive session to be authorized for example the personnel executive session allows discussion of several listed personnel matters and also requires that the viewer discussion usually will be expected to damage an individual's reputation or invade an individual's right to privacy similarly in order for municipal officers to enter executive session to consult with a code enforcement officer the discussion must involve an enforcement action that is currently pending in court and which was brought by a co-enforcement officer who was trained and acting as the town attorney in summary before entering the executive session board members should review applicable statutory criteria and be confident that a proposed executive session because squarely within one of the subjects allowed in the law legal assistance should be sought if the board has questions as to a proposed executive session next we will turn to the portion of the law addressing records the right to know law contains a very broad definition of public record that defines record in part as any written printed or graphic matter or any mechanical or electronic data population from which information can be obtained directly or after translation which is in the possession or custody of a public official that has been received or prepared for use in connection with government business in essence for record under the right to know law includes almost any information related to municipal business that a municipal official creates procedures or possesses a record made through paper documents computer files emails audio and videotapes db games cds phone drives or information in other electronic formats generally a municipal record will be considered a public record unless a law or other employee contains the record confidential be aware that there are many types of confidential records under both state and federal loans any member of the public may ask to expect public records for any reason at all the right to know law states that a record request may be presented orally or in writing and also that it need not be presented in person remember that the right to know law merely provides citizens with access to public records that exist on the day of the request the law does not require miniscule officials to answer questions in writing or to create new documents upon request nor does the law require municipalities to understanding requests persons seeking to inspect or obtain copies of public records on a continuing basis must file new requests that they want access to records that will be created after the date of the original request members of the public desiring access to public records may ask to visit the municipal office to expect records of schlipson and either make copies or have copies made in order to inspect records in person the requester must make an appointment during the reasonable office hours on the staff person keeping fragrance at a time when it is not incomplete a member of the public would not demand immediate access to records or demand an after-hours appointment a person may also ask in the disability to assemble records and make copies to be picked up mailed and forwarded to the person the right to know law requires every municipality to designate an existing employee to serve as municipalities public access office the public access officer serves as a contact person for public records requests and is responsible to ensure that record requests are properly acknowledged and fulfilled municipalities that do not have regular office hours must post the main phone number of the public access officer in a conspicuous location in order to facilitate the public's access several time frames apply to fulfillment of the regular trust first the record request must be acknowledged within five working days of receipt we recommend that the acknowledgement of the arrangement possible the municipality may also ask for clarification of the request if it is unclear usually clarification questions would be included with the acknowledgment within a reasonable time the municipality must provide the requester with a good faith non-binding estimate of the time it believes necessary to fulfill the request and the law requires the municipality to make a good faith effort to respond in the time estimated record requests must be fulfilled within a reasonable time this is a flexible time frame which may vary depending on specific circumstances including the breadth of the request the estimated ease or difficulty of locating and retrieving records as well as municipal staffing resources contrary to popular belief the right to know law does not require record requests to be fulfilled during flat days if a public record contains confidential information that information should be redacted or blacked out before the record is provided to the requester generally public records stored in an electronic format must be made available either as printed documents or in the media in which the records are stored at the requesters option except that the municipality is not required to provide a record in electronic format if the record contains confidential information that cannot be removed from the electronic record in such a case a paper copy with confidential information from drafted may be provided the law does not require a municipality to provide members of the public with access to a computer terminal georgia provides software to the new records nor is the municipality required to convert records to different electronic formats upon the trust members of the public may now be charged with fee to see the record request nor may a municipality charge for in-person inspection of public records however the charge for staff time may apply if the public record must be compiled or reported in order to be defined for inspection the municipality may charge its actual costs from all records to a person and it may also charge the reasonable copying fees however effective october 18 2021 the law will limit the copying fee to 10 cents for standard eight and a half by eleven black and white page and the law will prohibit a per caged copycat for records in the providence of china in addition the right to know law allows students for time spent searching for retrieving filing for the jack of accommodation for requested reference effective october 18 2021 the first two hours of the municipality's total staff time was free but thereafter a charge of up to 25 dollars per hour for staff time for foods and if conversion of an electronic record is necessary of the coverage of actual cost perversion during china now the municipality must prepare and estimate that the time and cost required to request within a reasonable time after receiving requests if estimated fees exceed thirty dollars the requester must be notified when the principality proceeds to complete and if estimated fees exceed a hundred dollars or if the requester has previously failed to pay record fees the municipality may request payment of those fees before it proceeds to compile the directives but regardless of the total people ruled the municipality may require payment of all foods because it actually provides the records to the requester and we recommend that the municipal offices will drop the written feed policy so that these will be administered in a consistent and appealing way if a record request will be repeated the refusal must be issued right with five workplaces the municipality must state the reason for the denial for example it might cite the statute doesn't mean that record is confidential a tentative denial may also be provided if additional time is needed to research the status of the requested record for consultant legal counsel a willful violation of the right to know law is a simple violation carrying a potential penalty of up to 500 which can only be enforced by the attorney general or district attorney also any agreed person may appeal to superior court seeking review for an alleged violation of the right to know least can include a court order voting for decisions made in an original effective session for an order directing release of public record the right to know law requires most municipal boards except for purely advising humans to create a basic record of their meetings this requirement applies regardless of whether the board took action and needed the meeting record must include the date time and placement meeting for present and absent an action schedule if all of all votes were taken the record must include all motions and votes taken by the individual member the record requirement doing that with a written summary over an audio video or other electronic recording needed the record must be available for public inspection within a reasonable time in addition the right to know law requires a written record of any additional approval or denial for the municipal application license certificate or current the written record must include the reasons for the denial or state any conditions of approval similarly the law requires a written record of decisions involving the dismissal or refusal to renew the contract with a public official employee or appointee except in the case of a probationary employee the record must state the reasons for the decision including findings of facts sufficient to reprise the individual concerned and any member of the public of the basis for the decision be aware that state or federal laws local charters and local ordinances may also require written decisions in certain situations however review of these laws is beyond the scope of this presentation record retention requirements are not technically part of the rights but are closely related state archives laws and regulations impose record retention requirements on municipalities by requiring municipal officials to preserve and safeguard the records of their office these laws also prohibit destruction of municipal records except as allowed by the law together with the state archives a state archives advisory board issues detailed regulations and schedules concerning record storage and retention of municipal records each municipality must retain at least one copy of each municipal record for the minimum retention period required by the schedules these schedules and other guidance materials can be accessed through the main secretary of state's website the right to know law requires that certain officials complete a course of training on the requirements of the law on the municipal level the training requirement applies to municipal officers which would include select persons counselors and plantation assessors it also applies to municipal clerks treasurer's assessors and their deputies as well as budget committee members school board and committee members and public access officers and effective october 18 2021 the training requirement will be expanded to include managers administrators code enforcement officers and their deputies as well as planning board members these positions are subject to the training requirement regardless of whether they are elected or appointed positions covered officials must complete training within 120 days after taking the oath of office for each new term he or she is elected or working to serve the training requirement can be met by completing a training course that summarizes legal requirements regarding public records and public proceedings which outlines procedures for complying with public record requests and that summarizes penalties for failure to comply with the law alternatively a thorough review of the frequently asked questions section of the maine attorney general's freedom of access website will fulfill the requirement after training is completed the official must make a written or electronic record attesting that he or she completed the training the record must be kept on file by the official or the municipality and must be available to the public upon request a sample certificate of completion is available on the main attorney general's website and also on nra's website [Music] and review thank you for viewing this video mma members are encouraged to contact mma legal services with questions additional materials and resources thanks peter next step would be selection of a chairman you know we start with roll call we did things a little backwards yes you're right so yes i'm kevin bouchard i've been the resident of turkey since 1979 um i spoke at the last budget advisory meeting and my comments were in our packets here you know i feel i have a background and experience that can help contribute to a committee like this if you want more specifics about what i've got i'll tell you i'm jason barnes retired a couple years a former controller for smith farms in their various businesses background is accounting mostly did serve on the town council for two terms six years uh which ended december 19 2018 so i'm very familiar with this process i guess uh i'm danielle cody probably the most green on the board um moved to fort not too long ago have a history with municipal i worked for town of madawaska as deputy clerk so do have history with keeping municipal budgets they're not your average budget so and then just i have a young son and we're calling fort fairfield home so just to see what fort's got to bring so um billy joe sharp lifelong resident um most of my experience relating here would be obviously the clerk position municipal experience um being directly involved with preparation of the budgets and the information of the budgets minutes of course public hearings so and you know the background experience with what the departments have to go through with all this too so i'm really hoping to be the the middle man maybe the person that can stay the most objective um that's my goal not to take any sides but be fair for everybody um so i think it's really important i'm pat canaven i have let me see i am a resident of fort fairfield i've been over here i don't know 20 somewhat years most of my life i think i've spent one way or another i lived here a couple of times before then um i own a business in town i've owned a couple of different businesses one non-profit i've had to work on budgets by no means do i know municipal budgets i know i have a lot to learn and i'm willing to do that i have a great interest in serving on this committee because i think it needs to be something that's informational and educational and i want it to be positive and i want the best outcome for the town and the residents so that's my interest in being on the committee i have a business in town and i've been on other boards my name is i think i may have been beat by three years mr and i've been here since 1976 born race okay the first time i've ever been live so um i've worked with epas for 16 years and really i was i've never really contemplated public service because i think you have to have a certain mindset to be there but getting exposed to the actual budget committee is kind of under the radar if you want to call it that we don't have an actual authority but if it gives me that exposure to actually know what's going on so that we can actually eventually get to that point that maybe i might consider doing something like that but i'm here to learn i've dealt with federal budgets which is kind of look at municipal budgets like we're talking billions of dollars at the time versus millions of dollars so i mean i've seen budgets so i'm hoping that we can actually look at this i mean everybody here we don't want to give up services we want everybody to have what they want but we also have to know that there's going to have to be a group effort to accomplish that task so i guess that's all i have to say does anybody know that i think they said 13. i think that's what i think that's what andrea said we talked about at the second yeah yeah i mean i listen i like the number seven it's it's a number that affords a reasonable amount of input you get some variety i mean if you're just like a group of three it's hard that if you become a committee of 50 well you can't get anything done right but right now just don't get any worse so like whoever came up with the number seven but by the same token do we want to invite other people from the community to participate with us i don't know who all threw names in i think you're opening up a can of worms your budget the committee's going to serve its purpose but it's open to the public to come and listen in here if we get into discussion you're going to have two three four hour long meetings and that's what the great part of that public hearing was the other night i thought that was amazing there's great back and forth with the public and that's what it's for and whoever's running the committee can control that yes yes obviously if you've got 49 items on your agenda that's sort of my question is i i think we should be looking for public input but we don't also we also don't want to service yeah my only concern would be our time frame we don't have a long time we don't to get much accomplished to be able to provide anything useful to the council this year right yeah one is we're going to try to get something to the council only first or at least i would say for this first one i've got something that we can talk about here in a few minutes one of the things you'll see about me is um whatever group i'm a part of i tend to be a very active participant and i do my best work when i put stuff on paper i sort it out and organize it and you know build on on various things yeah those are we've got a really really difficult task for the 22 23 budget you know so so that's one thing that i i'd like to see us come to some kind of a again some kind of a consensus of what we can report back to the council is this listen we've got a five-week window here what do we think we can do but i'm hoping this group stays together for more than just this one budget i'm not sure what time i don't know the length of two years a two-year program right now so we have this well the appointments are one and two years ago it's gonna stagger yeah i was disappointed that that was one of my comments last week my experience with committees and whatnot the first six to 12 months is a winner i mean you know um so those of us that wind up or might wind up with one-year terms you're just starting to become effective so that that's the logic behind my asked in the council how about two previous terms instead of one and two but that said if some of us don't have the ability to don't want to commit to that kind of a time frame i think we need to honor that also i don't think there's a problem to get reappointed no there shouldn't be should i make sure if you want to serve it wrong [Laughter] or not do we want to put in straws or names for chairman i'd like to nominate jason since he has experience of a budget i mean i have a committee or you know the council he has many years i i would nominate mr barnes we're going to go to the formal process jason and i have not talked about this a whole lot but i think the experience you have working on the town council is invaluable you know knowing the internal mechanics of the organization well like billy joel i mean i she knows the process too we both do i mean you all be working and i'm sure again it's helpful all in favor all in favor eden is yours um selection of a secretary i'd like to nominate danielle either love you too we had a brief discussion i don't have a laptop at home i'm sorry you're welcome [Music] finish meeting dates and times i can't imagine be beneficial to me more than once a week uh but i think we're probably gonna have to do that around the only request that i have is what did you say aaron for a night you couldn't do wednesdays i mean if we if we have to have a meeting with a wednesday night yeah well i think where we've only got so many weeks and the council council meets on wednesday i think we need to keep it early in the week so we can get more in before that wednesday the tuesday tuesdays i don't have any preference uh i don't but kevin and janet and what are your schedules any time after 6 a.m and before 10 p.m i only work till 2 30. so i don't i'm not i'm done i'm out at 4 30 so you have to wait until 5 30 or something yeah right at united states you're rarely going to see me here like this uh when i work for are joe yeah but that doesn't happen just the way so the early should probably be 5 30 yes six ships keep it at six yep okay tuesdays at 6. um now under the training we just had we don't have adequate time to post for tuesday uh we've got fridays every sunday monday tuesday's the day business i don't know what the word is if rather than adjourning this meeting you know if you put your meeting on hold and come back and finish it you know what i'm talking about that gets a little sticky that gets sticky in there that's kind of standard when you have a town meeting form a government yep council i'm not sure but we're not a council we are a board but um i know what you're talking about i'm not sure we could do that mma recommends seven right but if we could get our paper first thing tomorrow yeah i think our charters friday saturday sunday monday tuesday i think yeah if we could get that out first thing 8 15 tomorrow morning because i think we try to post friday for wednesday's meetings so friday saturday monday tuesday wednesday at 6. that's i think five is is acceptable i think can double for the public it it is acceptable it would have to be posted tomorrow tomorrow yep it would be one time only and then we can get on rotation right then we'll get on a rotation would it be reasonable to plan on every tuesday at six at least no no until [Music] [Music] every tuesday from here till the 15th is a standing and if we do have to cancel then we can set out an emergency notice okay that approved that sounds good okay okay so we're good with the town charter building as far as i believe so yes okay that's one okay two seas at six till june 15. okay take a stab looking at going through this um yes sir yeah you've already had that discussion [Laughter] okay this committee might do for the council um i think it's realistic or not but you know what i just handed to you is okay so we don't have a very direct charge and i hate assuming because i get myself in trouble but looking at what's going on looking at the public interaction the last two budget meetings which i thought was freaking awesome i mean it was civil it was i didn't participate in the last year's budget process but i heard an awful lot about it i i draw the conclusion that we have a lot of people in town who have a concern with the budget where it is and where it's going okay um we basically have five weeks which is nothing yeah as far as the time frame and so like at the bottom of this page is a prioritization scheme that you know is my logic yep what can we do in the time that we have yeah you know the the number one is just total global budget okay just the one big number at the end okay i think we can deal with that but there's a lot of there's a lot of detail that goes into those things all right and then drilling down you know a department's total budget stack up all the total budgets okay you want to get more detail to get into the detail of each individual budget you can even go down to the point of line items but i think we all agree with that we're not going i think we're closer to one than we are to three on this thing uh you know so i i'd like someone else's yeah yeah which what you all think i'm i'm with you addressing individual live items i think with only five weeks you may be able to get down to some of it but you're not going to be able to get down to hold it exactly right so i think what we need to do is just like you said we need to prioritize what we think we can look at first and go from there yeah okay what's what has the highest impact in the world right okay i can help you with that see you're just waiting for somebody to lead you down yeah that's what happens when you're retired you can do all this stuff i've created a bunch of businesses i've had to put stuff oh i don't have to put stuff together for bankers you know they are a different type of creature careful i used to be a banker there's nothing wrong with you [Laughter] there are points in a person's life and then the business like a banker is your freaking best friend does anybody out there want somebody i need to keep one for the main files that's fine i have 10 of everything there there's two there thank you and i really didn't have the time in putting the stuff together and some people helped me with it but i usually like to check and check and check and check and make sure you know there's one one spreadsheet that i was looking at and the number didn't balance i couldn't get everything to add up now it was like six thousand on a hundred somewhat thousand dollars but still one of the things i learned about accounting if you're off by a nickel you might not be off by a nickel you might be off in one direction by ten thousand dollars and five cents and then the other direction ten thousand dollars and your thing is a nickel so a lot of the the i think we need to focus on the amount of money we're asking the citizens of the community to pay to run the community correct i agree okay yeah because like the school budget got someone under the budget a couple of weeks ago got thrown into the box i'm sorry we can't control the school budget no not not in this form in this building okay there's room for input but it's not here okay county budget's the same thing so personally i don't want to waste anything and when you start looking at global figures well they're perhaps global figures but they're not necessarily what the people the the property owners of fort fairfield are paying so i'm scratching my because i think that's what we got to pay attention to yes you got to have the overall budget but what hits people is the money that you're asking them to take out of their checking account to the town yeah so that's why i picked on mill rate yep yeah that's what it gets down to because ultimately that's what we bring into well that's that's it okay you the town generates the money that it generates from the community through taxation of real estate and business work personal property so that's my logic for focusing on building all kinds of ways to create no eggs okay but this is a recipe that comes from the state of maine bureau of reference revenue services okay and i might i'm not sure if this is the latest generation of the budget or not but either way it's so freaking close it doesn't matter okay when we go through this process [Applause] and that's that's the number that's been thrown around that has everybody all up in arms and everybody all worried and everybody else and it's not accurate but this is also okay that's another thing you're going to find about kevin if i'm wrong i have no problem with any second you screwed i can't prove your math but i've seen the i've seen the formulation and it is a very very specific formulation that comes from the state and there are a lot of other factors than just this here but you remember one mill blew this town over so my thing is if we plan for you or we base our things on the worst case scenario which is worst case is if it does go to 31 what can we do based off that turnover if the budget was passed what can we do to help that number right i agree with you that it may not be there it may only end up being 22 or 23. after the town assessment correct yes right and i think you know a mistake that was made last year was that the mill was set too low the mill was brought down to the absolute minimum the state would allow which was the 19.5 which is where we're at now when we could have been 22 which still would have been down but because of the assessment and the stress and the anxiety and every the buzz in town the council felt it best let's keep it low we've got to give them a break and that's what happened now 22 let's say we do take the jump to 25 26 it's a heck of a lot better than 19.5 to 25 or 26 than it went from 22 to 25 or 26 right right so it's going to be it's going to look here there are and i think you know that's what we got to really look at is yeah there's no way you're gonna be able to hold it okay that's important it's just i think we've gotta take each department and you know i got a real good feeling and i'm sure billy joe does these departments some i have no issue party at all but there's others that we've really got it and what's going to happen is you know it's a delicate situation because you you uh you set a arbitrary figure we've got to cut this much and just but you jeopardize the part and fold it up you know it's also functions so and they need to be cut back i have already on the library for the slate group i've spoken with a grant writer that has a huge pocket to go out and look for grants for that type of stuff as soon as they let me know they'll let me know if there's anything out there for them the other thing i know one of the counselors that said why don't we just put a regular ruffle well before that happens you better check your other grants that you've got for this is called the site to see if there's a stipulation correct you'll have to pay back and that would be even worse and and you know the figure they threw out was there's no politicians and there are right you can do grants without having to match up there is all that so like i said i get this person goes to lots of different things and they know what's out there for granted you know you're a community member and they're more than willing to say that i'll check into it and see if there's anything else so but these are the things that i guess they need to have more resources on or to understand that there's you know i agree with that because i've read down through all of these requests and all of the all of the explanations and the justifications and some of them are very very clear and very concise and you know you know that that is needed there's no arguing there but there's others that like you this might possibly happen there's a potential this could happen those are less specific and you know those the last thing i just shine more flags the first paragraph the perception is everything okay right it made me want to physically go look and see if some of the things that were happening were happening is there pain feeling is there you know i wanted to go physically see it so i could find out this goes to our initial discussion right uh we don't have to do that every budget request can be justified i don't care what it is every logical legitimate rationale behind you how many horses are you looking to replace this here foreign how many pair of boots do you want to buy it should be between the apartment right so that's what the second thing that will give you sort of talks about and the back of that she talks about my utopia budget process which kind of happens that's the discussions so the second thing particularly that i gave you that has some color to it um given the limited amount of time that's available to go with this where do you want to go with it and like what has one of these things like there's some departments you can look at and at the end of the day and you know one that i'll pick on is the festival you know it's a wall that's it that's the whole freaking thing it always you know it has there's a huge increase but like jason says they've got money coming in it's a washing don't waste your time often there's stunning process right so right really not an issue that's not it isn't worth discussion right and it's bringing in income for local businesses so yeah no it's you know again so that's just one example um so it's like i took all those that were over 100 increase over 1819 the president made them read i took the like 25 or less made them green that doesn't mean one is where they are it's just top three bottom three and everything else is in the middle i don't think we have the time to look at every department's issues yes i think everybody and those are the ones that you need to really laugh i mean they have high expectations and the reserves may have to disappear you know it's all automatically there's no reserves past years when we've had difficult budgets to put together i mean you start with the basics i mean you know you got some increases fuel you know and there's no sense to get down and look at that and how many gallons it's gonna be there and i don't think it's there's any inflation you know right beyond that your labor issues um you know we do have some that are contract union so those are untouchable those that aren't those that aren't you you know you're in an atmosphere of eight and a half percent inflation you if you're offering i think it's probably in the neighborhood of two percent for most employees that are non-union i i just i hate to think i'm looking at cutting i mean you can't you gotta you gotta do that my thought is you gotta look at what departments are asking for any new personnel perhaps recently added personnel and then also new programs you know the wishlist which we know there is some about there and you know you need to get back to basically what the budget has been the last couple of years and not the adding programs or people unless we're not seeing and not just municipalities i mean you know the guy who bought my biomass business changed the fifth wheel on this truck last year he does business for pioneering partners he also helps them with some of the major repairs the same fifth week we all know yeah we all know working the same i'm sorry i get to talking sometimes and i take it for granted that somebody knows somebody says something same fifth wheel same supplier same shipment 1800 okay tires that we used to buy for 250 to 350 you're lucky to get in for 500 today you can't even do that i know a guy that for a steering tire it's pushing two grand never a steering tire on a tractor trigger oh and inflation [Music] you know i got a cpi thing at the bottom of this thing because the reason the cpi thing is there is to try to find something objective that you can hang your hat on now i'm not saying that we have to live within the cpi because i'll give you my perception of the cpi this is a federal number the feds want that number to be small you know so so they they structure it in such a way unless you're a philadelphia lawyer or you know some freaking genius numbers it's really hard to to pick through it but cpi is a number of people understand no they know what it is they may not understand everything that goes into it it's a federally generated number this one is for the northeast us i tried to find one for maine and i couldn't find it but you use that this is like a reference point because i'm trying to find some what can we hang our hat so the colors were sort of my way of figuring out where do we want to spend some time i think we need to spend some time in the top three for sure i don't think we should waste our time on the three green ones yeah and we shouldn't waste our time on festival i mean that that's barely because it's like you said it's a wash yeah okay crudely very basically the process i would go through is what's a reasonable number for this community to contribute to the teleport fairfield during its operations and then drill down backwards from that and i don't know how realistic that is or not the other piece that i personally would not be opposed to is finding sources of lack of revenue the money that they can come in now the highway department shouldn't be competing with your business that's inappropriate correct but are there services that the town can provide to individuals that can bring some income into the tower you know like an example my dad was fire chief in van buren next to forever they used to look to burn hay fields for people and his logic at the time is key driver burn it with the staff and the equipment control and trainers versus just enough totally out of control most communities have gotten away from doing that i would pay before fairfield fire department to come burn the hay field behind my house wouldn't give them ten thousand dollars but what would be reasonable we could sit and negotiate that and not only that because then they can try to do a training exercise just like they had them doing the extraction from the cars i'm certainly going to spin up to the law homes it was incredible you know and and i don't know what we have for our staff and resources but you know are there sources of income somewhere another thing where you were just saying that and i think we've been within the last couple of years you can tell me if we've done this but i can remember one point where the town would go or the firefighters would go around spraying the arms clean clean clean the parking lots and it would be a donation to the fire department i think that's still on the table that that can happen i think they use it also as training for the hoses and the equipment and the trucks and the valves and everything too so i don't know if there's a donation parking lot no we have a sleeper but we don't do anything city cable couldn't pull that off because there's a couple local companies right that are in the business business yeah so yeah parking lot cleaning care we should not be doing that right right you don't go competing with your local businesses it might be if we don't have any landscapers per se in town and personally we don't care about that they want to bring them driveways and they gotta pay the utilities oh water and then again pardon me um was that back when we were a volunteer fire department though now we might be that's why we might yeah was it before i think it was the year before it was just before i don't know i don't i mean we need thousands and thousands of thousands of dollars right right that's not just one driveway from my perspective i don't care where the department spends what i care about is what they spend versus what comes in and what's the net you know and remember they're gonna spend money to do that and is that just gonna cover what they're gonna right by the time your fuel at seven bucks a gallon here okay yeah it can't be a wall yeah right extra time on the engine unless there's some other value to the department like jason mentioned you use it as a training program yeah right i mean if you're gonna if you're gonna spray a yard don't spray they're here in the parking lot you know and i'm not saying that i'm just saying no exactly say hey all right pay us 500 bucks and we'll go straight down first i think this leads me into the suggestion janet made um at the last public hearing and i think it's huge and i think it needs to be be visited and i think there needs to be another committee formed to regionalize our services because the thought was there when they first started about the service but we needed to get it off the ground and now we are and now it's true now we need people to go out and really be aggressive really push these councils go to their town meetings and try to get in and you know look you know but i think we burn bridges with prescott i don't think we want presque isle but what couldn't we get wouldn't it be nice to get used to the route one acre eastern side of caribou around limestone through east it's a necessity it's going to be done yeah i mean we can't we got to share it now it won't survive we've had one before uh and yeah it went falling out and yeah it can't sustain itself [Music] and i think it's aws oh like their map they're kind of no what we're saying is the model we we had a solid waste issue right from the communities caribou for fairfield and limestone got together yeah put together try community link correct you know subsequent to that style bought in and now it's called aws it's a model of communities need to do something for their residents for their landowners and they got together in a cooperative manner and created a non-for-profit entity that exists to serve the donor community whatever you want to call the now four communities that started it there's a perception out there that limestone does not want to work with us limestone doesn't want to work with anybody they are an absolute well terrible community yeah they can't work together they do they have a very very toxic did it with the fire department yeah they can't they just can't work and they hold their end together no and it's sad that that becomes an issue of how you structure it true yeah yeah yeah and only bite off but you can chew and give them the commitment my my conversation was with christopher this is paul's son yeah right wrong different christmas chris is on his second term as a counselor and for fairfield sorry and when i started this i was talking with chris about some other stuff and in the course of that conversation he mentioned that he's on who came in came to the discussion he was on the council i wasn't aware of that okay so he got off on another intention and uh the long and short of it is he is of the opinion that there's a significant number of people in town government who are open to sitting down at a table and working out shared service agreements with neighboring communities on the ambulance issue it's really simple put yourself in limestone shoes caribou's charging 100 bucks yeah and i don't know what number was thrown out at them but i've heard everything from two to five hundred dollars i don't know what it is but if it's a hundred and five you get in the water okay you've gotta be where they're at and i've seen a chart of what communities i think the most about all of those probably pay for ambulance services and 100 of that talk that's as expensive as it gets some compute communities are paying like 30 something 40 some dollars and it's been a while since i've seen this chart but you know 30s 40s to 100 that that's the range should be around so if you go knocking on your neighbor's door and so we'd like to work with you on whatever uh i would the other person i had a conversation [Music] and make that long story short she is of the opinion that management at various levels in the city of caribou are very interested in sitting down with neighbors and talking about shared services right [Music] and in my conversation with chris you know he didn't remember the exact number but it was several times what lime sandwich came in here is the number that was presented so from chris's perspective it's not an issue we don't want to work with you it's like we can't help you finance your operation if we're going to get together and we're going to share services you've got to do it in such a way that we're all benefiting if one community is putting more into whatever the venture is another community that puts a little bit less into it i mean like this is dark and big but you know kind of one and that will happen and this might have been part of this he conversation terrible and prestigious had a conversation a while back i'm not doing stuff i think one of those followers i almost think their style might be unionized but whatever it was okay whatever it was the the organizational structure of the workers in that competition again using aws no no let's not check the whole thing but see i would personally i would approach something like this your goal would be something huge and saving millions of dollars for everybody that start you start building relationships and you do some little thing that doesn't require a huge investment you know was ways to help the count office versus hiring another person so i mean when you start looking at i won't say businesses but the places that actually have employees from them so you look at the technology um way up here you pull from other areas to get that down here so that you're now going like this versus like this so if your peak area is just as an example and i will sit thinking it's the other night perhaps at the library so say for instance first thing in the morning you have some elderly folks coming in for a couple of hours and then from like 10 to 1 30 or 2 o'clock disclosure again so then you adjust your library hours so that you're open for two hours in the morning those four hours in the middle that person or one of those people or two of those part-time people whoever they are comes and works at the town office takes the pressure off the ladies it covers it covers so that they're now not having to cover for lunches like shutting down the town office for a new time having lunch you'll have people in there to actually work then they're going back to the library when the kids go to school schools have three law they're back there from whatever time they leave here until the end of the day we're still gonna be a full-time date or eight hours but then you're managing that people now i understand summer's coming and it's going to be busier but on the other hand you meant you managed to that was what i'm saying i think but then but but now she's going to hire another one yeah because that's what i'm saying yeah this is obviously just a suggestion but if you can pull from that report at the library where juicy i was when i'm saying we're just saying okay we're raising you so share be smarter schedule take those hours put them over here so now you don't have to hire somebody at the library because you're working on them when you started your conversation i thought you were going to say have someone work the morning is didn't the library operate for many many years part-time before our library was hired couldn't with this day in digital age everyone using google and kindle readers and everything couldn't the library be open wednesdays and saturdays stop by one day we borrow the book dropping off on the other day there's people that are going in using computers right people are sitting outside getting free wildfires and the goal of that was for their kids to get their homework done just rarely ever see anybody really in the library is it worth the cost well and that was that was where i was going was not necessarily that we want to shut the library down because it obviously is a historical place we want people to have access to it to when they're using printers to when they research it because it's a live event you don't have a laptop but the library has a computer that you could do in there right right part at this moment i do agree with what you're saying if we it wouldn't have to be a limiting of hours on this individual day you just say okay you're going to be open on thursday friday tuesday so you're still adjusting those hours to the other areas in the morning get into those type of details right but we can get into details suggesting that okay you don't hire them right you share something yeah but you know you work it out somehow it becomes deputy clerk slash library assistant your fellow cows people in the basement and explain to them why you think thirty one percent is different for thirty one yes but on the other hand if you could sell it that hey this is what we're gonna do in an effort to drive that rate down we're going to reduce some of the hours at the left those people are going to come and help that office because the town office needs that it's also how you sell it so listen you know i'm listening yeah i can agree to that my only concern would be when you when you go toward the town office side now i see the extra bodies in there and i would have thought too on a personal level that the closure from 12 to 1 would have gone away by now we had to implement that because there was we didn't have the people i we couldn't we couldn't leave to go to lunch um the tax collector was there all day long so i'm like well you know it just but that that can be that should be eliminated now we should be open like we were 7 30 to find no you know no closure for lunch there's enough coverage over there right now um i don't want to beat up the town office that's my that's my baby you know i work there i know the mechanics of it and it's and it's hard work but i do know what they're doing right now i mean you saw me leave nidra became full-time and then at that time we had a part we had another full time but she got very ill yeah um she's still out right now in medical she's gone through a lot but she's coming back so that leaves the clerk and then those three people out front which is it looks like a lot but they've also cr cross trained every one of those people because ella is 76 years old she is going to retire and she is she tried to train me back when i was there and i went into payroll and i was getting into warrants and i loved it i loved it but couldn't do it because i couldn't get my job done there wasn't enough people to help so i had to bail out on her and then you know she has days where she's god love her she's not well she needs to be out but she's a trooper too and she's going to come in she's going to get that done so what they're doing right now they've got shannon she's she can do payroll she can do warrants and then shelly same thing so you've got that coverage we lose ella tomorrow there's someone there that can pay the bills and do payroll and everything so they're doing it right now we never could do it before there was not enough bodies so yeah it looks crazy in there that there's that many people there now um when you saw two most of the time but working there was hell it was hell to work that way um i had so much sick time built up and vacation time built up when i left there and that was actually something i had addressed i said you know how much people bank out of here for sick and vacation time because of staffing and and whatnot you know i mean and that's an unexpected expense for the town absolutely when you're gonna pay someone out there half their sick time and all their vacation time they built up um six grand yeah oh and that's why i'm gonna use and i'm not saying and you can't take that away from them right if that library is not busy but on the other hand if you can mitigate some of that pressure and even if it's only a simple tasking like if they're just doing the customer service and letting the other ladies that are already trained like all they do is answer the phone right so it's it's a i see it happening i'm i'm with it but i don't want to see someone else's job yet no the town office does not the library does yeah the library is a librarian the library wants the 20-hour eight i thought she told us in the last meeting that they wanted full time no no part-time so in regards yeah right if we don't hire one at the town office what i'm saying is the hours from the library still come into play and it doesn't necessarily need a library if it could be uh and i'm not saying i haven't forget that this is taking the wrong way but what i'm saying is even the wreck department at some point like i understand the wreck department is there for everybody but if there is a slow time when they can take two hours of it and now this is just an example if you enter your day you come down and you answer phones like it doesn't have to be people from the library it can be anywheres that you can mitigate that increased traffic like and you might notice that it's only on tuesdays and wednesdays from 10 to four that you see an increase perfect you just bring those hours or two and then you have that many more people working there on tuesdays and thursdays [Music] absolutely you're describing almost [Music] right right that's what i'm saying it would involve us getting those people trained and understood understandable but on the other hand if we slowly work them into that that's also reducing and it's showing that hey this is what they're looking to do to reduce that overall budget right keep in mind the wreck department granted i know i would abstain from any vote toward the rec department works there however you know for example there are cert tuesdays and thursdays i believe my son would go in the assistant director goes in like at 9 30. and he takes till the 5 30 which gets all the activities after school and the kids go on and kevin does his early to the 3 o'clock or whatever they're flexing they're flexing summer's coming mr sharp's gonna be down in the pool took over tim watts that position they hired to tim for 10 watt to do so he's going through the training now to learn the pool the chemicals the maintenance the whole nine yards that will be him so you've only got a little the wreck is not as flexible as the your library plan right at the library i see that but maybe not so much over here so and that's that's why we're saying in the beginning like during the summer obviously we know that there's going to be busy repairs in the direct because the kids are going to be at school old school goes back in it it may be just we use the librarians during school like they're coming up here and then when school goes back in we use rent i'm just saying it doesn't yeah yeah it can i get it one thing that says okay so rich apartment we need seven hours a week from you we'll leave it up to you when you guys can come down but we need your coverage during these hours all right that's just a suggestion that's what as a supervisor be fast that's what i did when i knew but you're talking training people yeah that's going to cost money to train people the clerks that are in there would be the ones that would happen that would step out to the library to do those 20 hours yeah it wouldn't be somebody coming in because you're going to be spending a lot of money training these people for what these girls are doing i've gone in and trying to get registrations and there's a lot to it and there's a lot of training time involved and i understand that so what i'm saying is i'm not saying that they're going to become a deputy town clerk now but you shake from you should take from here to put down there not from there here maybe not hire that 20-hour person so like chrissy should go down for three hours on monday and then shelly goes down for three hours on tuesday you know kind of do that kind of and the girls can rotate week on week off whatever yeah whatever that means how many years were there just two of you in the office um so when i got hired in um 2010 um there was three of us but i came in um waiting for someone to retire and it went down to two and it stayed two full time back in town hall down when it used to be where i care pharmacy was there were only two very uh there was well i don't know how far you want to go back in years but i know becky did work down there at one time when it was there mary sue levasseur was there at a time um linda dougherty was there and i mean tony can tell you more about the history of that there he said there was like five at one time and one of them worked for the population was a lot more true than it is now online services more people are buying hunting license phishing licensing registering atvs cars everything online now and yet we have four full-time even though more online services are available we have a business river's edge variety that's going to sell hunting licensed vision license registers sleds atvs it's going to be less work for it's going to be less less revenue we're losing revenue for everyone that buys online and everyone that buys it river's edge yeah granted it's not a lot but it's but it is lost forever it's revenue revenues revenue we lose two dollars on new dollar on re renewals and yeah multiply that over is there really there is now that the the structure is the way it is with um when ella's doing you know what and everything she does she's got she can hand over the warrants to the other girls so that day she works on warrants and then when payroll comes up she's got that person so when ella vacates they don't they'll replace her i think what they're going to do is they're going to slide somebody into that position and try to get you know one down and keep that the way it is and get back to the fire department that's her yeah that department i remember when tom used to do it in the pool he had a high school student running school so um that's and we had a lot more kids back then so that's another issue they want to get a trailer to haul stuff in well that's a wall not a need and to go out and try to solicit people to put stickers on it and charge people for all the stuff he's talking about in his budget is really double dipping because he's asking the same festival people that are giving donations he's going to ask him for donations too he'll get sick of that real fast so um those are things and charging a yearly admission for our town kids you've got so many low income kids here there's got to be something else done because 15 bucks is a lot of money for these low-come families per child and i know they're looking at a family um i just don't see that that's right after x amount of kids is worth it but when you only have two or you know you're still paying your full value you know right or single mom you know i mean like you're still paying your full value so and that's uh i guess those are mine that i mean that place that and yes i'm not sure how many volunteers tom had back in the day but we seem to have expanded our rec department um yes and there's a lot more kids there's less kids in this town and my found tons to do before there's plenty of activities i know there was that program where there was the kayaking and all that stuff and that was a grant there's got to be stuff up there still that brings that kind of money in so that you can can uh there should be there's got to be something and i'll ask that grant person if they can look into that because that's what they do for money yep is there any logic to looking at the total proposed budget and trying to figure out if we can afford it and if we can't what we can i'm talking about us here yeah yeah well if we were looking at what he said maybe 22 mils what would be the income that we that what would we need to do to do that and cut this budget to fit that you won't know what to wait you won't even you see a minimum of 22 were suggested by the state this year we should have done that last year brought it to 22. brought it a little further so yeah i think you're like i think from what i've understood um and had discussions about i think the minimum is going to be closer to 25. we won't we won't the council can't can't over supersede that overrule you have to stay there's a minimum that the state will allow you to go on a maximum and you can't and she said it could be anywhere from 22. oh did she okay i i don't recall her saying that okay right that was the rainbow game yeah i think yeah that's the other thing that we need to consider john q taxpayer gets a bit and worst case scenario instead of a thousand and sixteen fifteen hundred well and that's the thing like i was just sitting here thinking even if you cut like if you're proposed to increase your standard mass goes to 60 you cut that in half you're still going to have a million 25 and when somebody gets that bill going from 19 5 to 25 or 26. it is on top of inflation that's going on right now i don't know what the numbers are but the percentage of our residents who are on fixed income who are senior citizens of social security who are low-income folks that are going from hands-on you know everything you look at today but you also have to consider that a good majority of the people in this town who are low income are living in subsidized housing or they're living in housing units so they don't necessarily own property no i'm talking about the property okay but [Music] right like going to the pool or whatever and you know you're still not going to be able to pay i i would never want to turn away any kid in 80 degree weather that they can't go to the pool and go swimming because they can't afford a fee but their parents can't we need when you talk about an increased mill rate i think because we went down to 1905 last year right and now there's going to be an increase regardless of at least 22 right i mean figuratively yeah and there's unknown factors that come into it that we don't have or we won't have um like we don't know what if they're gonna if the state will change what the valuation exactly yep and what revenue comes in from the state they don't know what that will be we don't know what homeowners might be they might give a an increase in homeowners exemptions i don't know so those are all unknowns they're giving me every one of those and go in and work this budget around 22 that's what i'm saying because we know it's not going to be 19. so if we work this budget around that and that number because the 22 is no mark it's just a mark exactly that's what i think needs to happen we have to we don't know we got to pick a number and start working there because you don't have a number people sit here talk all around yeah if you leave i think what is that you told me you figure out what you what you can spend council figures out what's a reasonable number that we can start to run this the job of the school board was really simple is to hire a superintendent the job of the superintendent is to work with his or her department heads to manage the school school boards have no business telling a math teacher and telling a history teacher which subject everyone would cover so i take that we feel that the citizens of this community and the businesses can afford to give you this bucket of money i need you to go to your department tenants and negotiate with your department as to how you how you divide that part of money oh that's exactly right i mean it's your town man they could go to what's in a department this department can have x dollars no more it's up to the town manager to manage how that gets done but you know and that's that's certainly the time manager can come back to the council and say i need more but i would hope the council and i believe you will see that i mean if you cut reserves and whatever yeah they're going to move it's going to happen yeah there's going to be changes yeah but the final step once a manager has worked this out with his or her department heads that's presented back to the council for ratification and the council is expected to ratify it unless there's something that's grossly i don't know okay the council should not get involved correct absolutely absolutely yes and according to charter they can't own it absolutely or because we have five weeks oh you should be like like damage you're saying if we settle on 22 you base the rest of that on everybody's budget that they had submitted yeah we can all find ways to carve big chunks of money there you know i would think that the reserves are an easy target because reserves services with a significant increase to your tax revenues uh costs in a particular year are less than they mean tax okay let's take some of that but let's not take a year is a big issue uh i'm a believer in doing the research but there's there are times right you don't right and i know the point yeah last week you know you have equipment i've dealt with farms for you know to try to build a reserve based on that you just can't do that now but i am a believer in some reserves that it's gonna have to be my new it's gonna have to be very money right you know on your topic you every piece of equipment was tested and reviewed okay every puffer was tested over here every freaking host was tested they're all stamped with serial numbers and you watch those tests and when the proper is getting closer to minimal accepted okay you know what's coming if you know your numbers you know within five years this machine might no longer meet standard that's the yardstick yeah but my point was too is that we're selling our stuff to everybody else and we're getting all brand new bells and whistles and it's like uh and we didn't have a payment on that yeah and this is where these guys take all ten years is that what's getting them on it's not the stuff isn't thrown away it's uh and it's big money i mean you can't even get a voter right now and i'm telling you a new loader a 960 cat is 434 000. that's just and that's you know that's your average water in your business that's that's a drop in your bucket no i'm just kidding you know i understand them needing money to buy equipment but i also made the point you have a maintenance budget right well if we don't use that well then while you guys are sitting around doing nothing let's get these out and run them get them tested keep them working get the oil moving we under i understand that too because we do that so it's but and it's not like they need to get out and move and they don't just sit there while they're and i said when i say the guys at workshop they'll be standing around you got something to do you stood there for the last 15 minutes that was your break so you're gonna go work for the next two hours right it is true well i see a floor in there [Music] but that's you know until shane or mike or chris is back here or even wayne you have something to do until they come back and let you know what your next move is so i mean and i mean i understand and i see again fireman's daughter here the brand new truck roll into town holy cow does that look good you know it's all shiny it's all whatever but sometimes those old trustees are your best ones i mean dad's truck it's uglier than sin it's some old farm truck that came out of the farm and they put a tanker on the back of it and they're like that's a fire truck and i'm like awesome sweet but you know what i mean it sounds like hell when it's going down the road but you know what it pumps water first of all it pumps water second well it's at fire station number two so the lake has access to fire station rather than all being and going into insurance a pc10 which you're going to pay top rate for your insurance there's a fire station that's local so i mean it sounds like hell you're grinding gears i mean dad has driven sick all of his life and i mean he could not get that thing into third gear you know but and i don't want that for these boys either you know what i mean because then you've got young generation i style every stick that i drive it's ridiculous i will be going 55 and stall it and i'm like don't know how to restart this so we're going to wait to like cruise come spend some time with me i saw everything everything every second gear second gear does not like me but it's do i want the boys stalling this do i want the boys having a hard time no i don't want this i want automatic trucks and i want them to fly but the other thing is they get their licenses is what you have to buy you can't just get a license now if you if you did your license in an automatic that's what you have your license correct correct which i mean do a lot of these kids even know how to drive stick anymore that's too bad well i never learned listen like i said i still i'm a farm girl and i saw everything you need to get back on track yeah if you're going to get a cdl today right you know how to drive stick you can no longer uh but if it's not in place yet it's gonna be in place so you will not be able to get a cdl without without saying no we'll call this formal training cards right do we look at and and set the future on that brand new fire truck or do we look at a refurbished or you know one that's retired that one wasn't brand new even though it looked wonderful and yeah we knew the eyes were going to roll yes but keep in mind that yellow one that we got from lda the lauren development authority that was here forever and ever when that went out to bid of course they did their research about what it was going to cost and get it back i expect that road worthy and i can't remember the numbers and then when it went out to bid even ex-chief paul durapo called and want to know you know can i put a bid in he said he wouldn't even give like a hundred bucks for it and he used the piece of equipment so he knew it was john it was yeah just to defend a little bit there he was garbage he came out he laughed at me on the phone i'm like i don't know anything about it but he said i wouldn't even give you a hundred bucks for that oh he wonder what it went for and i told him what it was i wouldn't even have given you 100 bucks for it right okay then don't but you know but um so yeah i i know what appearing again perception and appearance has been a killer for this town and the staff and the departments and and i love them all but i agree i agree with all the conversations here as well that's why i'm like i'm really interested in this because i want to put my input on what i have experience in yeah and i want to be fair and i want to be just and i want it you know i think it's important well a well taken care of 1980s truck you know rather than a 2022 sometimes they do just as well too so you know not as long as it can make it to the house your house is burning you thank god i'm close on time and give an idea of a budget for so we can let them know what our thought so 22 is low but yeah i don't know that's what i was 23 right so i'd rather not find out the town fire department response at that time [Music] which gives you less than halfway but that still gives you a four mil increase i would rather do less than that 23. they need to put these down make them work the budget down that's fine because if we listen no you're not you're both right okay let's say in the back of our minds we'd be happy with a five percent let's propose three and a half three half and we'd be happy with five okay no don't you dare tell because the state's going to set a 25 yeah yeah so i think 22 is too low yeah they just started something lower to bring them to get their budgets down as far as they can get them for needs not wants um take 19.5 times 1.0625 i'm assuming you have a calculator and it's hard to judge the mill rate and what the mill rate is going to be worth in september let's go start over again 19.5 times 1.125 because 21.9371 okay here's something sellable okay you just calculated an increase which is double the cpi increase from 20 from january 21 to january 20. what's up how do you do 12. yep actually and that's the same that's right that's 2193. that's what we can call it 22. if we just went 22. right yeah well what we're talking about here is where the hell you get 22 well we're offering the town double the cbi the last year but didn't you say earlier that the cpi is kind of just the cpi okay this is an opinion okay i'm not a phd numbers guy neither am i but i want it to make sense for the community that we're in correct so i'm not sure i mean but what the number that we just put on the table here is double the cpr okay so that helps to address the fact that it's conservative it helps to address the fact that we've got inflation just going freaking rampant you know just out of control nobody knows where we're going to be at the end of the year on cost of doing stuff but you got to start some of this okay and i cannot speak for the council but i would like to think that if fuel goes to 10 again and highway police fire come back to the council and say guys i need more money to put fuel in my vehicles i would like to think the council would try to work with those departments and to say okay this is unforeseen who to could have could have predicted we're going to six and change today yeah i couldn't have yeah okay we need a starting point i'm amazed that we're here right now i'm sorry i thought we were going to be here in three or four weeks at this at this point but it's a starting point right and we need to have starting points and that's i mean these it's a struggle to look at those numbers and to know that if we don't have somewhere to start we can't i i would really struggle saying to somebody we're going to 26 mil from 19-5 whether the council will prove that or not last year doesn't matter it's the point that we need to have a starting point now because if we don't you can't get them to bring the brush down they gotta bring them out that's my thought problem this is what you've got you decide what you really i agree that the budget i agree with almost everything you said however i think that we have to have a starting point that is not bare minimum we did bare minimum last year and we know that the projections are a whole lot higher this year if we go back to bare minimum this year and inflation continues where do we stop right i mean yes we need to have a starting point and i i can agree on i can agree on a little bit of a higher number than 22 22 i'm going to have a hard time with because i think it's too low but we need to and maybe they can't get their budget down they may not be they may not be able to i think we need to go low too i just don't want to go that low it's a start it's a starting point i hope you heard me talking to you i don't know right she'll get less but if she asks for 25 she might even get 21. okay i just described the opposite of what we're talking about as coming down to a number we've got to work our way up to some kind of a number and i get that too i'm again i'm gonna go on the work here before and and and i know these people right now and and that probably won't change but just please try to keep in mind too the people that are providing this service and that are working here there are so many people on that fire ems side um and even maybe pd that are so uneasy right now that they're even going to have a job and we have worked so hard and put so much money and expense into these people and we've got good people i wouldn't just say that we've got really good experienced people and matt chief cummings has brought that pd back up yeah here um yes and i'm worried i'm really worried that if we yeah if we if we push them all i get the starting point i get it but they are right here they're great they're right there and they there's like three of them now that could go anywhere they could go and they could be gone yeah we're gonna lose them and we can't recruit everyone's having a hard time getting them back in and petey you know that matt's doing a great job i think we got our pd pretty good but um these are specialized people specialized training and they're good people and they're they're providing a great service and we knew and unfortunately yes we knew most of us knew i wish there would have been a higher turnout when the service was getting started and the work sessions were here and we had professionals coming in and doing work sessions with council and the public about what this was going to cost and what this was going to do to our tax base and they said in three years and here we are it's true it's happening and the people that maybe didn't get involved and didn't come and get up to snuff um and it sucks sucks for all of us reading our newspaper articles and attending those meetings he never said that but a counselor unfortunately said that by mistake it was out of turn it should have never been said he as a matter of fact corrected and said this service will never sustain itself it will never it's a service that will never make money for you it's not a money maker it's a service and it's going to cost the public money so now we have the equipment was there ever a what prepared it's a financial projection there probably was there was i'm sure there was there was scott soucy come over from caribou and there was a bunch of them and they set and they pounded numbers and i don't like like i said i was they have to it would have been a public record yeah yeah because but i i think the point really joe made is valid you know if [Music] they're willing to cut i know they are they're going to cut their best okay and then a liability safety is going to be the word and again here we are we can justify everything we can recruit everything but what i can tell you i'm not starting to do anything like this i'm asking anybody about this but if i was in a community or i was looking at this kind of a tax bill and i get that and mcgillin's pays a boatload of excise taxes at this town yeah if i do this and i can speak to myself i can speak to my daughter i can speak to other i hate to use the word professionalism with the public perceptions of being professional when you're looking for a place to live some of the things you think about their skills some of the things you're thinking about their tax rates that's probably it's not the top two it's very freaking close yeah here because the tax rate was was better than what it was impressed services weren't the same but you didn't but what's what if we started 24 like the others and be comparable be kind of right on that cusp like i still still i think we should start level and let these guys cut maybe they probably can't get to percent but they need to really take a good look at their budget i don't think their budget will look that very well they need to work at something to help this i mean the reserves are going to take quite a bit out if there's no reserve but there's other things that i i said that can be cut there there's um i'm going to like i said i've talked to the right right now what their business is their brand to see if there's monies out there for the rest of the president and for the library uh right now and they're there's um to see what is out there available and they are highly competitive there are some that are very highly creative and everybody wants them right you do if i'm a department head and i have a budget that i have to submit every year for review and approval or not approval or whatever i'm going to submit for everything that i might think that i might ever possibly want i can justify it i'm going to ask for the moon and i'm going to know that i'm going to end up cutting some do a real something and that's visible in this budget there are some that should that ask for the moon and there are some that are very cut and dried and everything is explained um so i would expect to have somebody come back to me and say nope this is where you need to be kevin pretty well highlighted the departments that are addition yeah because the others there's a lot that is also out of our control you know labor yes yeah that's all out of our control and obviously fueling the mr [Music] i am [Applause] so i think what you need to do in this and i agree with what i'm saying is i agree with scrooger is getting it as low as possible so if like bob joe or billy fine which happens all the time yeah [Music] they're thinking that the rate is going to be the lowest and it's going to be possibly 22. that then i think what we do is we we because we are just a committee that is saying hey take a look at this advisory this is what we're thinking the town would accept without exploding over the people that are putting this budget in if we can if we say yes we think you need to go back look at your budget and get as close to 22 you possibly can that you know they're going to come back and say this is where i'm at and on an individual basis if you get and you say okay you dropped your uh increase from 18 uh and 19 down to uh 250 percent versus 1413 then we know you looked at your budget and you cut it considerably you know what i'm saying i mean you could bring i don't know if you did this on a laptop or computer but we could plug these numbers in once they bring their budget back it's an excel spreadsheet okay so but that's what i'm saying is then you can look at as an example um the library where they put it didn't i see on the budget they were putting in like 150 thousand dollars in the reserve yeah that's the roof for the room it's a fictional number to begin with because they don't know they have no idea what it's going to cost she literally takes her budget and she what the total cost would be the project couldn't even physically be done if you ordered it today right three years so why would you put it all up there day one right if you want some 150 why not split it in three years or something for the moon thing yeah and so and that's what i was saying about the possibilities for example a fire department so i just made a suggestion i have a fire uh in plastroc there's a fire chief that goes to church with me and i'm like where do you guys do he said we buy our trucks from uh metal fast i think it's in centerville yeah and they're the ones and so i thought he's like yep he said that's where we get our last tracks i'm like okay well at least that but if you instead of instead of you saying that we need five hundred thousand dollars today okay so why can't we do this in increments you know you're going to have your stuff that's going to be needed five years down the road like you were just saying great split twenty five thousand dollars this year twenty five thousand next year twenty five thousand extra exactly right just build it up eventually and slowly have that reserve there so you can make those purchases i understand and like you were saying billy joe three years ago to set up we knew this was going to happen that's water and i'm not trying to minimize it but it's water under the bridge now we're the ones that are basically looking at it saying hey somebody is going to have to pull back on the horses yeah and slow this wagon down right the i forget who made the comment here a little while ago why weren't people here when things are good the town is running well it's quiet the roads are probably the winter time it's quiet we're not an unruly community where the police are trying to get the community into control the fire department they're running some old equipment they're getting by and you know things are good you use what you say is well we did a good job selecting people to be on the town council and direct where the community is going when you get yourself back into a corner which i think is close to where we're at right now all of a sudden everybody comes out of the woodworks and you know you're not going to have to worry if this tax bill goes high you won't have to worry about looking for houses that's and that's the scary part there aren't any right now raise your taxes you're going to lose your tax base but you are however and i i i get aggravated when i hear that i apologize just because i moved from my house those taxes have to be paid i don't want to see anybody move from town either this is our community i want people to stay but just because i moved from my house doesn't mean there's no more tax dollars coming in off it right and i don't want empty houses but i'm saying the money doesn't stop but that's the thing so it goes right back to what janet just said yeah i know i don't really see anybody going oh yeah it goes to 30 and if i owned a business as big guess where i had to give myself a pay raise by leaving the town [Laughter] i could build a building i mean i mean i know i know we need to be doing whatever and so the other thing i actually have for notes was making a suggestion is to try to get a business account say hey well you come and you sign a contract that you're going to keep your business here for 10 years for the first three you don't pay taxes and where's your benefit then where's they're spending money in the town they may want to move to the town versus and so now you're creating a tax base by bringing those businesses in because you're not going to want to drive when you're paying seven dollars a gallon for gas i agree with your businesses you also have them staying in town and staying open for a year or two so i mean we all have suggestions but i think we need to focus on those top three yeah and when we go back to the counselors and say you need to be 20 it's going to be more than just those three right so what are you looking at for dollar signs if you brought them down what's the population report oh i couldn't tell you 30 30. under 34. what's the population 32. what's up that's two years ago that's two years ago so brandon that's true that's true empty places that would have been the last census that would have been the last yeah okay so three three twenty-two yeah i have a really really simple one 3 400 people in town right 100 ahead 340 000 if you can operate the ambulance for 340 000 or less you have your own if you don't contract it out and that's what we should have done well we couldn't though until we got the licensure and the the the uh we knew it was gonna we're at that point now though we are there a competitive yeah financial and they're ready to do it they want they're ready cody even dc even said he said yeah we're we can do it now but we couldn't before right they're ready to rock and roll because they weren't officially they weren't fully set up and they weren't fully staffed right we haven't been fully staffed for long enough to contract it out and there was a lot of kickback from the people at the beginning was no no no this is our service we want it we're not going to contract it out right away it's going to be for us the people of fort fairfield first but now they they're established and now we can do that they gotta get the way out they can do that they can do that now they couldn't last year but they can now they're fully we were happy when the ambulance was sitting out in quagga joe to come into florida you may have been are you we everybody we didn't have control over that stuff right but we were satisfied with it but we didn't have control over that stopping listen why couldn't really it would be really really nice to have a level one trauma center i don't know if anybody knows what a level one trauma center is i don't give a rat's saturday what comes in the door they can take care of it that's exactly right okay it would be really so my point is that's really nice and it's nice to strive for it and it's nice to want it but if you can't afford it where the hell are you and like i say the ambulance is really really really really simple if it costs a penny more than 240 thousand dollars a year to the taxpayers of this community we should shut it down and contract it out who we caught contracting out too i'm glad they take you over so if i 100 but me as a severe allergic okay forget my epipen i have to wait for caribou to come down compared to running up the stairs it depends on what you negotiate at three hundred and forty thousand dollars they can up and change a contract just like presque isle did on yeah at any given time so i don't think it's very functional yet and what do we say for the money we've already committed to yeah right we've got these loans there you can't just you can't just say oh i bought a new car last year i don't want it anymore that's why i know since the beginning build a little garage out by the noise [Music] [Music] shut down is stupid is not acceptable excuse me for a lack of better words but we need ems we need fire yeah yeah we need fire yes we need a damn good fire department things burn so fast now like i said we need fire and and these costs of these these home claims are ridiculous if you don't have insurance we need emergency service coverage period comes from us like we used to have and we never had any issues yeah there were but there were issues there yeah there were no there would always be issues there wasn't trouble when there's an emergency that one question that i was going to ask is before anybody decides what needs cutting where they're going to cut is anybody that asks that people import like recreation ask people you know do we really need this program and that program and that program that's what to the extent of what actually takes place when you come into an actual budget here and you actually thought i didn't realize you couldn't come in and ask questions until mr silver got up and had to ask permission to talk yeah and i'm sitting over there thinking okay so i thought this was a public hearing right it's when the public gives comment so there's there's also a give and take there when you go to that podium you should be treating people behind this desk just as much respect as you expect them to listen to you we're all here we're all on the same page everybody is going to have to pay taxes listen that's kevin that's not anything official so it's just that's that's my so we're all going to have to come that's why we're here the people spoke when they said we would like to have a celebration right yeah they also spoke with you wanted an ems fire service too yes yeah yep do i agree we need something in town yes do we do i agree that maybe we should regionalize as well to benefit and reap those benefits or pull in profit whatever you want to call it help pay for it whatever so so my question is this so just just throwing it out there so if we know that we're looking at reflex or if we want to reach we spend the money this budget or do we i'm not saying that do we do we pull it back that funny with the ultimate goal of regionalizing it's not that we're not saying that we don't want ems service because that's not overcrowded well you are but you are some are some are if it flops it flops i hate to hear that i don't want to hear anybody any department shut down right we can provide we are set up to provide this service for us and now anybody else can't give it up why don't we focus on that and capitalize that right now right but if you offer it for 95 as opposed to 300 and you're not getting any then you're getting 95 you didn't have before the problem is you're still charging your people 300 yeah that's not a good name which isn't going to fly because aws did that for dump stickers where we were paying 50 and everyone else is paying money right right and and you've got to think so we will follow the aws model as well right right and you you've got to think of the the old you know people in town benefit better than the people you know away kind of thought process it's a struggle but i mean like i said we're just we're we're not making decisions i i yeah okay no it wasn't plugged in i'm sure nidra is gone i guess oh there you go you're good i think oh yeah she did that team went to orange,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,1r7nAHCNfgQ,"2nd Public Budget Hearing May 5, 2022",,148.0,8866.0,2022-05-06T11:39:59Z,none,200,1,0,0,i think there's some new updated information uh you know and i know we see the support that we're getting keep in mind this is just a proposed budget um i know we have some uh some work uh forward with the information we've got and i'm sure if anybody's got any input to to put this is the time to do it this isn't a debate uh this is just information from you people uh that you have and you want to conduct with the with the table we'll we'll take notes and uh at this time uh andrew did you have anything to add or do we wanna okay if anybody has uh anything i'd like to uh uh [Music] my name is kevin burchard i've been a resident of fort fairfield since 1979. i've run several businesses in the course of my career i had a retail pharmacy in the medical equipment business here in town in the late 80s to early 90s more recently i operated a biomass business that provided uh wood chips for the biomass border at protractor lightsaber historically right or wrong i shied away from getting involved in local politics my desire was to avoid either perceived or real conflicts of interest such as my dealings with the school department and out of concern for the potential negative impacts on my business by serving my hat is off to people like law who run a business in town and they're willing to go to take on these challenges for the community i understand we're not here tonight to talk about the budget advisory committee but i have a couple of recommendations that i'd like to make to improve that committee if we may the budget committee is is relative to the budget so excuse me get two recommendations on budget advisory committee and one question with appointments the boards and councils and committees or whatnot it takes a bunch of time for most of us individuals to get up to speed in my experience i found that learning curve to commonly be six to 12 months where you're minimally productive at first and you know the ordinance as i understand it provides for standard terms of appointees so that you have a similar number of members changing every year and i 100 endorse that concept but i would recommend and i hope the other members of the comedian might follow forms i don't talk with any about this anymore about this i would recommend the initial appointments be for two or three years as opposed to one or two it because of that learning curve issue that we have to deal with now i'm the only guy in the committee who wants that well okay i'll bow to the wishes of the committee the other thing my second recommendation is the ordinance as i understand it is silent as to the specific time frame of appointments and there may be something in town procedures that addresses this and i apologize if the problem is off on that the committee's only recently been appointed uh the budget process for 2223 is well on its way and my perceptions were closer to the ending to the beginning other than general overall recommendations i suspect there's not a whole lot that the budget advisory committee will be able to accomplish this year my my second recommendation is that appointments be to this committee late december no later than mid-january and the rationale there is i'm thinking the committee should be active at the time that you're working with your department heads it starts in november okay i don't i don't know i i was just you know we're coming in towards the end of the that is just the fact that this is when it got presented to us it's not a complaint it's just it's the calendar that we're dealing with right as we are here and then my question is the budget presented last week as i understand it has a deficit of two million nineteen thousand twenty twenty six dollars in it does the council have a plan on how it wishes to fund that budget my guess is you don't have one tonight thank you thank you anyone else good evening so we're making comments about the budget right my name is diana layton i've lived here since 2005. i'm here to speak specifically to the total uh fire department expense budget line um and i'll try to keep it short but i'm not very good at that so everybody in this room and everybody in this community need two things they need a safe community and they need an affordable community so far the safe community piece is pretty good the affordable piece is struggling a little bit i want to be clear that i've spent the past couple weeks being elbow deep in council minutes and videos and everything else to get a sense of what the motivation and the approach is to the current ems department the way that it's set up i understand that a big motivating factor is response time and making sure that we're able to get the people who need it i also hear the term we're saving lives very often which is accurate again we all need a safe community the problem with that is that sometimes when we posit that it makes critics look like they don't want to save lives and that's not true so i want to reassure you that i'm not just here with complaints i also have a recommendation so i was looking at comments in the big or daily news from the main ems about the national crisis of rural areas when it comes to ems services meaning this isn't just limited to our town and certainly other municipalities are struggling with this as well and trying to find solutions one thing that stuck out to me as they said for a single full-time staffed ambulance to be sustainable they need to be making 1500 to 1800 calls a year for a single ambulance i was thinking we have 3 500 people in our community and i wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy that we're going out and making 1500 1800 calls a year i also remember the remark that there's calls and there's transport and there's a difference between the two so i don't know if there's some nuance there as well maybe we're not even talking about 1500 calls maybe we're talking about 1500 transports to be sustainable and i don't think that's going to happen in our town and i don't want it to happen in our town so i'm going to say no that's not going to work and that's not going to be sustainable so we're not doing it alone southern aroostook is trying to get a consortium together of 12 communities and even maine emt is saying that might not work because i don't want to critique services i've heard very spirited remarks about we need to be able to do our jobs we need to have a living wage and we need to be able to do our job safely too because you're members of the community and you're absolutely right you deserve to be safe and you deserve to have an affordable life as well so i'm not here to critique services but that revenue piece is a struggle especially when we look at financial billing which again it's not just us it's not just us this is a statewide issue there are work groups coming together to try to figure this out we look at the other municipalities and the revenue they're pulling in that's not even super great to use the technical terms super great so i just want to point out the elephant in the room that the emt department the way that it's set up is not sustainable and it's what are we going to do in five years we talk about these are at least to own ambulances so they'll pay themselves off in five years and then we'll have them for five more years i believe former chief bolivar made that statement so then we'll have them for five more years and then what in ten years what do we do we do this whole process again i mean my son is eight he's gonna be graduating high school in ten years and this is not a far off conclusion my recommendation at this point and i understand it might be bigger than the scope of this room and it might be bigger than the scope of this particular budget but my recommendation is that at the very least in the coming year we need to either visit or revisit the possibility of a regional ambulance system that spreads among multiple municipalities how many municipalities i don't know it's above my pay grade but we need a regional system because we can't be shouldering this load all on our own it's not going to work it simply isn't going to work because the other piece of that affordability aspect is it's not going to matter if you respond to an emergency in 20 minutes or 25 minutes or 15 minutes if nobody's there because they moved out because they couldn't afford to stay not only in this town but maybe not even in this county because they decided to move downstate so they could be closer to the hospital themselves and i love them because they're informative and they're transparent and it's a tight budget but i also know from going to those that tax base margin we're counting those kids one two kids per year how many did we lose how many get one two we don't have a wide margin for our tax base if one or two households decides to leave fort fairfield and god forbid there are family with a couple of kids and a couple of acres of land that adds up and all of a sudden the police department that also has expenses and the public works department that also is dealing with the inflation that we're all dealing with right now the money is there and we're wringing out a dry washcloth so we need to do whatever we can to get back to that affordability piece before that bottom starts falling out i think a regional ambulance system might be the best approach and i would love to see some types of feasibility study on that thank you thank you thank you yes if you would like some of the answers we have done for the last two years and um i am spoken about utilizing the portals from marshall through to caswell um and that it makes the most sense having portrait feel centralized there and then reaching out to this corridor and then just like that straight line and we've we've gone to see them and we've given our presentations and they're not interested no one wants to pay for firing influence that's what we've been finding with these meetings um but we're going to keep having these needs and we're going to keep talking about how important it is to do that because it's really more about the service that's being provided for the safety of the citizens here in fort fair council because we do have mutual lead contracts as a community right as well um and it's important for us because we are a professional service and we're not volunteer we do have volunteers here on the fire side but you definitely do not have volunteer ems so it's important to make that essential and we are set out for the administration of such to happen um and we have legislation that is being presented currently that will make it an unfunded mandate for all municipalities in the state of maine to provide fire ems service for their communities so it's coming one way or the other exactly um and what that service looks like we don't know yet if it's going to be determined by the state or if it will continue to be determined by autonomy by your communities um so that's something to keep in mind as well and i i think d.c has something impacted mr chairs i i do want to say your comment about 1500 ems calls is 100 factuals proven fact but to be clear you need 1500 transporting ems calls to 100 pay for that ambulance so that would be no tax burden and so you know no service out of the southern quarter of the state and sustain that according to maine ems so it's not it's not just us regionalization is something that mrs powers and i and the council have talked about and tried to do it's getting everyone on the same boat because we have some places that try to do it for less and it's it's not easy it's not easy to find people that won't work there it's not easy to find people that benefit from that service obviously it's better than nothing but we try to do the best we can to the highest level we can and that's really what saves lives so it's it's not just us 1500 is accurate we can do 1500 calls you pay for one ambulance at no cost to anybody else all right class ams spoke bangor was close to that number but even bangor wasn't fully there so that is factual and it's not just us yeah so thank you for those comments and we fully back that um and we are working hard to get to that point yeah when we have those sessions again when we get back just to respond to that i'm all in favor of regionalization we've got a superintendent of schools that does superintend caribou does it here that's part of regionalization there's a lot of regionalization going on my question is and this very good point made by this lady here what's wrong with regionalizing towards caribou or presque isle which are also established departments that are running um ambulances now that are costing the taxpayers and the communities that they that they provide services to approximately 100 per capita where we've talked about this before ford fairfield now we're in excess currently of 300 per capita if this budget goes through we're gonna be somewhere between four and five hundred dollars per capita that's if the 400 revenue line is accurate i just want to point that out thank you uh we would love to regionalize with whoever would like to regionalize uh however we respond to care who would prescott to supplement their ambulances because they are over stretched they they have less people on shift than when i was a full-time paramedic import in prescott and they run approximately 400 more calls a year now with less people on ship and one of my last shifts i did 15 ems calls myself so regionalizing is great but if you're not able to send an ambulance it's ineffective if they're short of staff and we've got 11 full-time and we've got 25 total full-time and part-time it makes sense to me that maybe we take a look at sharing some of our staff with them and regionalized we already do share stuff that that's where that comes in the issue really is the shortage of ems providers across the state well really across the country yeah cross country yes and mcc is working hard to eradicate that in the county but you can only do so much with the students who attend college for that program so it is it is a very um hot topic and people are very one way or the other it seems very divided on this but as long as we maintain a calm discussion about it i have no problem sharing um information or sharing thoughts as well as i'm sure dc does but because we're not here to attack see him we're on this note if we had to tomorrow find the service that we provide in our community and hire that out you can't talk sandra if that no what would the price be what would the quote be um that it's changed exponentially since the last time you did that last i spoke with leadership it wasn't really an option but they do that but the price would be 300 500 000 a year six hundred thousand oh no just for us to work with houston was over six hundred thousand a year uh and that was just half cost that wasn't we weren't making any profit publicly so i'm sure with pascal would needed more um i guess the main thing that concerns me is like first of all the lack of transparency i i didn't know much about it i had uh um mr roulette stopped at my house to talk to me and mention some of the stuff news my name is paul johnson and i was uh i chatted with them for events but i had no idea no idea what was going on with lack of transparency but also it's like the the process of how these decisions were made and then also well i haven't had any information about why everything kind of blew up regionally with a program that was there before which was you know about maybe ten percent uh not even i guess many less eighty percent of what it is now the budget but i think i think more importantly is it is like like it doesn't seem like and then i i can't i can't i'm just like i can't figure it out that there isn't a process to kind of fade it in it's a good idea to regionalize and if that's the end goal why did we do why did we buy you know make this huge decision for example i want to i want a new truck i can't afford it i want a brand new f250 i can't afford it i have to wait figure things out you know what i mean figure out until i can afford what i can afford we have a very small relatively uh low tax-based uh town why did we just go do this as opposed to making it across a relatively long period of time and uh uh and making it more sustainable um i i just i i don't i don't understand the process i mean it's uh i don't know i understand risk versus reward but this is so much risk and i mean the budget again we need the services i'm not i i'm glad about the response time outstanding but uh but but uh but the that budget line is now nearly as much as a school and it's it's uh it's completely unsustainable i don't understand and as you're talking about people living i mean one of the reasons we chose fort fairfield is taxes were a little bit better than presque isle and stuff even though the services weren't quite there as far as like overall like big picture stuff i mean we're not from here you know what i mean we'll go closer down or whatever i mean i mean it's in you're gonna you're gonna lose people um um so so so uh i i guess um um as far as a question goes what was the process and why why was this decision made as opposed to decisions so like they would have taken more time and it would have faded in faded in more of a regional system as opposed to having a uh our own system and then trying to essentially not sell it but uh to to market it toward other towns so this was done over a period of time it was done very transparently so there was no lack of transparency we had public hearings here at the council chambers that were well attended and they had public opportunity to give that input and there was only one person who spoke against through all of that process um and they worked and the budget was transparent that the projected budget of 1.8 million dollars we started out slow like you had just said we did not go full on with how we were going to do this and we don't have brand new trucks but that's not but that's not transparency i mean i mean the the transparency is like i don't know how much a truck costs if somebody back then that eventually at some point in time we are going to have to fully fund this department and it's probably going to hit us above three years which is where we're at right now if we don't fully fund it now which was back in 2019 um and so we expected that this was eventually going to happen we've had these discussions every budget year about how it's incrementally going to go up so that we can make sure we are fully funding the service um the council voted on it it was i mean there was a lot that was said they are the legislative body for the time for people we are not a childhood important government and this interaction is not normal like the chairman has asked for us to be able to have good quality conversations back and forth with these citizens about this because this is a very tenuous year we're seeing inflation all the way around and if you're seeing inflation at home you can be assured we have inflation here with the town as well so we have responsibilities that we have to take care of so and all we're doing is presenting what it costs to run the services here in town this is a proposed budget for what it costs to run the services but what you're saying is that while it was being approved people knew it would be roughly 1.8 million dollars eventually down the road yes they knew that actually i had said that it would be over too many to run in and so it's come in under that number all right cool yes you like something there when was when was the budget number established during the startup period 2018 december of 2018. and it was discussed during the creation of the department that we could be spending in excess of 100 1.8 million dollars in excess of two million dollars and two million dollars okay and i was out of the loop on that i guess a lot of other people were and that was not at the meeting i'll be honest with you the number that i heard at that time which is why i didn't attend any meetings the number that i heard was this could cost us in excess of a half a million dollars that was the word that was on the street at that time i didn't attend of those meetings i didn't know about it until all of a sudden two years ago when it was created and it was starting so that's my fault maybe for not digging into it but i would like to see if there are minutes that actually state that it was going to be looking at close to two million dollars for this department two years after it was created in terms of that i'd like to see those thank you you know you can come and request us did you have anything else to add i don't think there's anything i can add that was that's i mean i'm sorry i will i hate this podium people i can't see the chairman of the board john won't let me sit next to you if you don't trust okay my me is if you pass this out tonight and there's no change in the school budget for next year there is that's why you have this number here too one did i not get everything i'm [Music] okay my question i do have a couple questions first of all when you do your calculations and i know a budget is just a budget i've worked with budgets everybody and my name is sandra dorapo my name is john he's with me but he won't talk because i talk too much um tell manager your budget is just an estimate but my question is on your estimate for 22 and 23 is not actually when when you look at your actual that you spent for 20 and 20 months yes we're not there yet we're still in this facility so we don't have an actual yes what's your physical year for the town we're we're july 1st to june 30th so this fiscal year does not end until the end of june the end of june so i have to make my predictions on what the state is going to give us for revenue sharing what our valuation is going to be there's a lot of things that take place between august september and october before the mill rate is set and i have to based on what's happening at the state level numbers that are coming out um inflation all of these things and what it costs to run our services i have to project what that will be because of our fiscal year so what are you projecting your military everybody's fiscal years are different okay july 1st i have a lot of other questions but this is just getting first of all chairman of the board i'd like to know who's on the budget would you tell me it was kevin budget advisory committee budget improvement encouraging committee who's here when you last time you had them weighed their hands yeah they uh raised their hands billy joe aaron jason kevin i know janet i think you're pat aren't you [Laughter] thank you so anybody else would like to add any concerns to the budget uh proposed budget um right now we don't have like well based on this it's gonna be just up to 30 or over 30. i can tell you it's not yeah so it's going to be 25. will probably be you you know how much it works addiction because we don't know those numbers so what tony does with that in the role of the assessor he does not get any of that information until september really and we can't finalize what we're doing moving forward um until after all the rest of our work is done like the summer assessment all of that stuff has to be finalized first um all i can do is give a proposed budget of what it costs for our services to go for and you'll you'll see this the more you start talking about the budget there are things that we cannot know but still have to project prior to the no rate um and that's how things will change based on the formula for the tax rate calculation which gives us the mill rate so there's a count a calculation it's sort of like a form that's filled out and it's all set up by the state we just plug in our information and the state does the rest of the calculations for us and that is how we get from the state whether what the lowest flow rate is that we can give or what the highest email rate is and then council can choose anywhere in between there from the lowest to the highest um and you want to think about your overlay um that you have at the end with your mill rates you should never have a negative overlay when choosing the no rate which means you're not raising enough money to pay for your services that you're asking for when you have a negative earnings you don't have a balanced budget uh there's in municipal government there's no balanced budget until the audit the audit is what tells you whether or not you had a balanced budget so it's not like a private like your own personal budget where you have expenses and income coming in it's not like because we raise taxes for the debt whatever the deficit is we raise taxes because if there is no deficit if our income covers our expenses all the way around between the school the county tax and the municipal budget we would never have to send out a tax bill and wouldn't that be lovely to know it's not going to go over well well again there's and there's a lot of things we could talk about with the mail ring but there uh were there was lots of discussion on not putting the mill rate at the lowest small rate uh two years ago um also last year but we did um because the discussion was we keep we've got to try to keep the mill rate as low as we possibly can but by continuously doing that year after year after year you're setting one of these entities the three entities that make up your tax bill you're setting one of them up for eventual failure because you don't have the money to make your services what they need to be your equipment is outdated your vehicles become outdated what you do for programming eventually gets cut there's a lot of things that come into that effect i will say this the mill rates all around us are much higher than our current memory at 19.5 mills um and for us to provide those services 24 25 26 in the communities about us but they have business to support part of that mill rate that's right and we are at a moment we are well actually we have businesses coming in as well um and and we speak about those during the council meetings so you could certainly come in and hear about all the new and exciting things that are happening um and i think it's important to remember that what we're doing here tonight is just presenting to you to the public budget advisory committee everyone honestly what it costs to run the services that our people expect that live here like these are the things that they want to see in their community um everybody keeps talking about well everybody's going to move but we have to remember we have a lot of new young families here in fort pierce now too that have moved here and and folks aren't really talking about them either but we do we have a lot of young new families here in town um i met with superintendent jump this week um and their you know numbers are shifting constantly we went over their proposed budget for next week um some years you you have more some years you have less it fluctuates so and those are things that we have to try to project as well um but i will tell you that we are all trying to work together to make this um a safe and affordable community to live in we all live here we want it to be like that nobody here is trying there is no glamour in public service i i will tell you there is no um nobody's trying to make this like the most spectacular look at us type of thing we're just trying to do our jobs and do them well and safely and the numbers that we have presented tonight are much closer than last week's numbers to what it will cost for us to provide those services um i'm ready to start talking about them yes so if you if you take a look at this the paper here the first point the only number that will not change or that could possibly change on that is the number from the county county the county tax that number is already set and that that that number will not change the top number from mscd20 is their proposed total budget for next week and we'll talk a little bit more about that in just a minute and then of course the bottom number is our proposed total budget for the municipality and then if you look at the bottom like we discussed last week our municipal income our our revenue that we receive here is 392 98 more than what our expenses are but you have to keep in mind if you flip the page over when we send out a tax bill it does not come just from municipalities it is three separate entities all combined together on one tax bill so the expense the total expense is your top number that you see and that is all three entities the municipal the county and mscd20 the income the income is our income that we receive there's there's no other income on top of that that is that middle number and then the bottom number is the excess on top of the 599 that we have asked for discounts have any questions so yes so this this that you see here the 599 129 is our total budget now mscd20 their total budget is 7 million 343 55 they receive very similar to the situation that we have with our municipal revenue sharing they have a system um that's called eps so i have that right sir uh thank you you know what that is essential services yes and so there is a um because of the state statute they uh the state will provide 79 of what that number is in there from their formula if the town commits their 21 to receive 100 and that number is 1 million 140 no 1 million 1 million seven 199 eighty six dollars and sixty six cents to give them their combined amount that they need to receive the five million seven hundred thirty eight thousand four hundred fifty five dollars and twenty one cents the excess that they're asking for is well what they're asking for from the town our portion they're asking for an amount above that 1 199 786.66 to get them to 2 million 203 432 so that's what they will be asking uh the town to put towards mscg20 this year um and we have to take that two million two hundred and three thousand four hundred and thirty two dollars and add that to the five hundred ninety nine thousand one hundred and twenty nine dollars and then the county tax which is two hundred and seventy seven thousand four hundred and something dollars you have to add that to that number as well and that's what gets you to the eight billion that you see on the back page the 8 million 479 770. so that is the three three entities combined is what that is now we take our income off of that and it only brings us to the excess of two million eighty eight thousand five hundred and forty three dollars now listen i am i am not knocking the schools the school has bills that they have to pay they have services that they provide they have to maintain their buildings their equipment their vehicles just like we do that it's it's no different the thing that we have to remember is though those combined budgets together our income is also being taken from the extra that they're asking for as well as the county so if you take the income that we will be receiving the 6 million 391 227 and remove from that the two million two hundred and three thousand four hundred thirty two dollars and the two hundred and seventy seven thousand four hundred something dollars from the county that's what is giving us that deficit at the end so it's it's not just the municipality it's not just the school it's not just the county it is all of these entities combined together and in a season of uh 17 inflation rate eight and a half percent cola rate these are all of the things that are making it what it is um so that being said i have the rest of the presentation for council if they would like so with the school and their their total budget minus their eps uh funding is funded at 100 which means they have to pay the 21 they paid the 79 the state would paid 79 that would give them their 5 hundred thirty eight thousand four hundred fifty five dollars and twelve cents um and then you take that out of the total budget they have um a deficit of that but they also have a fifty five percent that will pay into that as well and so that's why they're only asking the local is the 2 million 203 432 [Applause] and that part is important to remember as we go through the rest of all of these people so the first one code enforcement does the council have any questions for quote enforcement assessing community development marketing and economic development mr lebeck is here if you have any questions for him i will caution council again we have kept the quarterly review down to the absolute minimum that we possibly can but we do not want to find ourselves in the situation that we were just in last year with not having a rebound done for over 20 years and so we hopefully things will get better in 23 24 fiscal year and we're going to be able to start building that back up again um but i believe we're okay with the library [Applause] i talked about the amount of employees library last meeting one full time time correct and then we ask for an additional part time so three part time one full time [Music] in this library budget uh that they're proposing is the re added repairs that was needed for the sleep roof if you look to the bottom for the reserve yeah 155 that's where your 155 is coming up right so that's added in the budget for 22.23 correct okay yes we separated all of the reserve accounts for council so that they could see the difference between observer council and if you'll notice heating oil has gone up again as well as diesel and yes utilities so what's the cost of the additional employee like what's the total cost of that additional person well it's it's it's 101 528 i mean that's that's the total for one full time of three five times but you went down on your operations she did yeah yeah so in um if you look at the library budget you'll see that so [Applause] well is is there any grant money for that new slate group is there anywhere to find a grant for something to maintain that building because it is a special hysterectomy yeah it's a carnegie building carnegie library yeah so there's no grants out there that may help with that slight room so we jen has applied for several planets for the slate group and it always comes back as a denial because we have we don't we cannot show them like we can match there's usually a match to the grant and it's not just it's not just about that also um they required a written quote from a contractor all of the contractors are from down state they are booked out for the next three to four years and the only way to get them up here is if we have a solid commitment that we will fund it then they'll come up and give us a quote because they don't need to go looking for any kind of jobs so once i can get them up here to get a quote then i can apply for the grants but without that quote i cannot apply for a grant yeah so where did the 155 come from where'd that quote come from that is my estimate that you had asked for an estimate of what it would cost so i took the square footage of the roof and multiplied it by the average cost to replace a slate roof to get the 150 000. if once i get an actual contractor up here it may only cost 50 000 to do the repair but i don't know that i'm not a slave contractor and they will not come up here i have made repeated repeated calls they just won't we actually the matching amount what does that have to be well it depends on the grant if some grants are for 20 000 and they want you to match twenty thousand some of them are sixty thousand it depends on the grant and what what grants are available at the time that i applied we generally try to look for grants to apply to that don't require a notch but sometimes sometimes sometimes 50 percent usda r d is 45 match so they won't even come and look at it no and what do you have to do to get them to come they want a commitment but it's paid that it's going to be paid for that they so they don't want to come and waste their time quoting something and then you not do it because it costs them money they have to bring equipment up scaffolding and everything else and set it up to even be able to go up on the ribbon how that usually works is in the bidding world you just go for three bits usually and you pick the bid that you want you lose three bids so to get three people to bid a job like a slate roof it's i gotta regret it's gonna be tough and so contractors are going to drive for five hours six hours whatever and to spend an hour or two and my other issue is so most of the grants have a deadline in the time that you can use them most of them maximum is two years if a contractor is scheduling three and four years out i can't even apply for that grant for another two years because the grant would expire and i have to return the money before we can pay the contractor so it's it's very fine line of timing but i can't without some kind of commitment that there is money there i can't they won't even look at it and it's just going to sit there and deteriorate so how much extra like funding grant funding are we eligible for by keeping it a slate route is it even worth it yeah at this point yeah because you lose that status yeah yeah but if we can't fix it and it's costing us extra money then is the status really it affects our archives there's grants that i've applied for national endowment for humanities grants 90 percent of the reason that i got that is because the library is carnegie library and it's in the national detroit register and that was 27 000 i i guess i'm just i'm just wondering if it's costing us more money to keep it now over it since i've i've been a librarian i know that i have gotten close to forty thousand dollars in grants and the majority of them would not we would not either have been eligible or they would have bypassed this for somebody that was that did happen okay i'm the librarian many many grants for the future right i've been there october will be eight years that's a lot of money to get in eight years since i've been here before i was here i think the biggest grant that the library had ever received ever was ten thousand dollars besides the actual building from the carnegie but we're asking to put away 150 this year is that what is requested that's what i'm requesting it doesn't mean that we'll have to use all of that 150 000 but if we were able to put away say 50 000 i can't guarantee that i can't i i'm just you know you wanted a number this was a number that i had to come up with i can't i can't guess i'm not honestly yeah i and if you only put 50 away and they come up and it says that it's eighty thousand but that's what we have that's true reserve admin reserve accounts for so we can use funds from that if necessary i've asked for money in my reserve and it's always been denied or taken away one hour wow it was never prepared for before i started zero in there now there is zero in there now so now we're just we've been waiting we've been asking for it for three years eight years i've been asking for it for going on this will be my i'm sorry so you mean in the last eight years you haven't been able to get anybody to come over that room there's a real flicking nail it is not but there is when i type the drone photo the drone go up to do the photos there is a ten foot section it's called hip roof i've got a real big education on on ruby so why can't we send those teachers down i have oh i have they don't care they have enough jobs they don't care like laying your eyes on on a job you know yeah yeah so let me ask you anybody actually going up in the attic area with good lights and looked at all over we have not it's it's very very difficult to access um mike greenlaw when he i had um i needed to have a new emergency light put in for the front entrance osha regulation he came to do that he had to he looked to see about how he could run wires to it it's in the bathroom and it's a drop ceiling and there's one section that you can pull out and you have to slide the ladder up in there and climb up in he was able to get his head up in there but he said it's very difficult to get in there without ripping the entire ceiling out taking all of the tiles down um so that's why we haven't done that he shined a light over congress write a senator or a congressperson and take that out you can i can't do it right there so last year when we did the budget we talked in discussion came up of you know possibly not funding any of the reserve accounts and we were told that we had to fund the reserve account so this is saying that we didn't fund any on this no she she already used the what was put in for this fiscal year and approved right but there was a reserve funded last year i just wanted to clarify yes you are friends sorry so there was money that was put away that roof was 30 years old and so we're not that was that right it was young but i just wanted to clarify that yes there was money funded for it right so it wasn't just correct that that was the other side yes okay okay right and how much did we find last year five five thousand okay five thousand which is i get that's part of the 155 i'm asking for the 5 000 again and so what the real 50 though would be a huge jump compared to what we write last year so my 5 000 and i'll tell you how i get to the 5 000. that's if you have a brand new roof which we now do you put a thousand dollars away in 27 years you have the 27 000 to pay for that route another thousand dollars needs to be put away for a new furnace our furnace in the old section as we talked about has been since the 1950s it is you can replace the motor but then what do you do if the eyes go back and you can't find eyes for it you're back to the same issue so running a dinosaur right exactly it is inefficient it's extremely inefficient and and actually honestly i think we do for such a large building we do very well with our heat because we have the heat pumps and we have the newer furnace that is also 30 years old now because it was installed with the origin with the new part of the section so at doing a thousand dollars for all of these different things that's where i come up with the five thousand thousand dollars for this route a thousand dollars for that roof a thousand dollars for this heater and a thousand dollars for this heater those are my five major issues that i will that i worry about um but if they had done that 30 years ago we would have had enough to pay for the roof that we just replaced we wouldn't have to defend it um administrative right and take that away from other departments and this is why i'm saying every year all we need is that five thousand dollars but it keeps getting taken away to fix things that standards and again it stinks to have to say from 150 requested to 50 but we can only do so much and i and i understand but i cannot guarantee that we'll get somebody up here right i can tell them look i have fifty thousand dollars set aside for this group where are you gonna get the rest of the money i'm gonna apply for grants well well where are you gonna get the rest of the money then i'll have to speak to my manager because there is money in admin and we may have to use it so if we approach it differently we may come out with a different answer that's just my recommendation okay red department hmm hmm because i have a chance to look at the um comparisons oh which is two no no not from last week they're the same comparisons from carol and president that hasn't changed their comparisons and do you have any questions so so so um on the playground for the wreck the 5000 uh you may have already said what is the plan for that like is it just the it's just the 5000 in the reserves uh yep so currently i believe if i remember correctly there's now if we get this 5 000 i'll put it at 15 000. um so as we stated in past council meetings we are applying for uh land water conservation fund to be able to redo the playgrounds and as part of that there needs to be time funds coming towards it so this gives us a start towards it now it doesn't have to be through taxes that we raise the funds it could be from fundraising um you know and we've got i believe if we i believe it's june 30th is when the application is due um and from discussing with uh we haven't got all the votes back yet uh as a matter of fact one of the people said we're not even going to give you a go um it's not out of our scope will work and it's okay you're a playground company but okay um but uh june 30th is when the application is due um and once we get that in if we get approved we can then start funding with more grant applications as well uh because some of these grants when you apply for them they don't mind matching funds because your matching funds can be other grants but what we need to do is have a number to know what we need to match but this gives us just something to go towards it and you said there's 15 in there currently i believe if you put this five on there as well it'll break so there's ten in there and then the parks and rec reserve that goes just to whatever the necessary things like the ten thousand so that was to start saving towards redoing the steps up front um and then there's a project out back uh the fire marshal has told us when you go around the back side of the building there is an exit door there even though it's typically not used it's just emergency but there needs to be a solid walkway of some kind yeah as well as um after this budget cycle goes through um we're sorry after this grant application goes through so it's about a two year process so it's equal to that and it just breaks it down we can then start applying for another grant after this one's complete start looking at redoing the community uh athletic boards so the tennis courts uh as well as the fencing around the pool so that stuff could help go towards that as well just matching just to have if we need to match great funds okay so we have seven thousand seven hundred fifteen dollars thank you hmm thank you fire yes did we get another sheet for the fire department over the same unless they got it how about we skip to the pd and we'll come back is please keep in mind counselors that we have a officer who will be going to the academy so when you look at the education training line that's why you're seeing the increased and i've probably asked this before but just remind me do we have a contract in place with this officer that after they go to the academy they are going to work for a certain period of time state law indicates that if they leave one of another law enforcement agency the other law enforcement agency is responsible for for their training costs first year forty six thousand second and forty thousand six seven fifty perfect i thought somebody couldn't remember so thank you is this 22 000 is that is it for more than one officer if you train for example no we have it's 18 000 for an officer to go to the academy yeah and the tuition is what you you've got to factor in the tuition uh for the academy the ammo the overtime the backfill of shifts the travel expense um it's intuitive close to twenty thousand dollars for the training not to include the shift coverage well while they're gone how many weeks is that you say how many weeks how many weeks is that uh 18 weeks 18 weeks outside of it about something good what's a contracted services what's that contracted services dispatch okay thank you this contractor service is something every municipality pays a pays a share of so we pay the uh the state of maine department of public safety and they provide they answer all of our our calls that come in to the station 9-1-1 and that includes the fire department as well that that cost that's in this yes so i just have to say like every budget what i try to do is i try to look at it and i try to find if there's any thing on there that we could possibly take anything from just so people know like every single line i'm staring at these lines and i do this at home and i do this over and over and over and over and so i don't mean to pick it like the department heads and say can we cut this can we cut that but i literally look at every single thing and honestly i have to say like your budget is very lean and i don't see anything even possible to cut i'm a taxpayer in this town too and i feel the same way about keeping costs down so yeah my budget corrects that yeah and i'm not saying that like others are excessive it's just some departments different things costs whatever but like in looking at your budget we have not sent the police officer uh to the police to the full 18 police academy since i went our last officer to go through fort fairfield so we've been fortunate enough that we've been able to hire officers with experience um so we obviously when i started in july there was nobody so i mean we're originally complimented with five officers total we cut that back to four to obviously do some trimming on the budget we also were able to hire including myself two other officers that have already already have a full-time certification so we don't need to go they don't need to go to police one officer in close to 15 years is to the police academy is pretty good it is yeah and that i'd like to add that's also set in a budget to where uh chief commons had to bring that department to from where they were the working standards were minimal and just reviewing from where it was to what you've uh brought it to rowdy but we you know we had to we had to outfit our whole department every officer from head to toe which is 3 500 at minimum per officer for gear equipment uniforms and things like that um you know we've thought outside the box on a few things and you know we don't use the most expensive equipment we don't use the most expensive uniforms we kind of middle of the road stuff so and then you got to keep in mind that things like ammunition have doubled in price and it's hard to get so i mean when we're paying 300 for a 100 000 rounds of ammo now we're paying 556 if we're lucky so it's just that's that's where we're at how long are you qualifying uh we are qualifying once a year but we really should be qualified twice a year um you know once a year to go out and shoot is not a lot so that's the minimum standard from the academy is is 250 round courses but i don't feel it's enough i think our officers should be shooting out shooting on the range more because you need to stay permission do they get practicing uh i i heavily guard the practice of hope i've been there and done that yeah i've been there thank you so if you turn back to tab four for fire this ems i'm not sure foreign so um if you remember from last week the emergency management that's a one-time increase in cost and that's for us to upgrade our bike system to a modern warning system it will cut down on our costs by doing this moving for the future of the dam actually it allows us to have access at the touch of our phones um versus having to man it 24 hours during asaps we'll be able to um versus having to go in so we won't have to pay people to man them how much do we normally pay for that on average do you have a cost for the amount that we pay our people that watch the house class it fluctuates so if you have volunteers you pay that minimum wage the problem is the past two years that i've done scheduling is you don't have enough volunteers covered so then we have to pay our town employees whatever their overtime rate is it doesn't come out of whatever department they work for budgeting right so what does it cost like what did we spend on that last year roughly do you know last year was substantial we had the issue with the gate in the um the pump house that broke it was down so we we punched 30 value extra yeah we did six payrolls last year so it was i don't have the exact number but it was we can pull that though yeah i'm just curious like what that cost versus the cost of the upgrade just for just to compare our entire budget it's a very similar system to what fort kent currently has and i have put in for a grant for that as well but there's no guarantee it's a federal brand so it's all across the country and that's the uh emergency management line on the ems line line yes the e01065510 okay and then the ems expense oh so the difference between um ems expenses and medical expenses coding fewer so medical expenses called medical expenses is expenses for our staff they have two fit testing they have to do tb testing coca-testing any kind of medical costs for our staff ems expenses are expenses for the ems service restocking ambulances and anything related to the costs from the idea that it was different in previous budgets but we tried to separate those clarifying costs if you remember last year everything was combined and now we've separated it so you can see more directly where those funds are going to let's talk and do a previous council member and uh as far as billing goes like uh towards an application if you pick up a patient take that patient to the hospital uh whatever you use on that patient in the process of picking them up and dropping them off um we have to pay for that taxpayers pay for those those products because that was explained to me was you relayed that information to the hospital the hospital charges their insurance company post so that's controlled consumables that is how uh ems building used to be done years ago medicare and centers for medicaid and medicare services changed the way handles building was done several years at least eight years ago we can't bill for individual items it used to be an itemized list if i used five ids trying to get your id we could build for each all five of them now it's a level of care so when i talked earlier about trying to provide the highest level of care if we provide a basic life support service which would be an emt basic there's a set amount of money we charge regardless of what we do on call if we provide an advanced dmt there's a certain amount of money we can charge for that call if i provide a paramedic that we can charge x amount of dollars depending on the level of care on the ambulance and the only fixed amount we charge is the amount we charge for mileage and you can only charge loaded miles so we can only charge from where we take pick up the patient to the hospital for mileage and then our additional cost is per license level so again it now it doesn't matter if i use 100 iv needles trying to get driving or if i use one it's still whatever that set amount he is that we built and then when we submit it to insurance uh that's why we paid this billing company they fight to get us the most of what we built and their averages we need to 85 depending on the month every month sometimes they can get 90 sometimes they can get 80. so what is the highest level did you say airbag parameters so it's uh cms center for medicaid med care services it's a bls so there's bls emergency bls transport als one emergency als one transport and als ii so als2 is you can only get that from a paramedic care it's doing multiple drugs or um doing specialty i like innovations or if i use an i o needle and then the als one is like an advancing t can get that but als one is the majority of our our calls whether it be paramedic or advanced emg but they've all usually fallen down so the ems loan was that is that along with paying back candy it is okay so so i hate to pick it reserve accounts and i know i do it every single year so you probably know what's coming um but i don't know how else to look for a way to save other than to look at those types of accounts because the services we have to pay for and i want to be able to fund them so that you can do your job adequately and people can get paid what they should get paid so when i look at where expenses can be cut i look at these as a savings account you know you you pay your bills and then you put what you can into a savings account so if we have to look to cut that's where i'm recommending so maybe if you can look at what you can cut there that would be i know i know that you that sometimes we can't cut any of those but if there is uh yeah if you look compared to the last one i did cut our education um and training preserve if you guys are able to fund my education and trading budget line items then i i should be able to manage to get the training that i need without without the reserve for that the other line items the ems expenses the trump reserve the scba replacement those three specifically are are very large ticket things we just had a big conversation about why the library doesn't have reserves for their roof and why we the life expectancy of our equipment if it was new today divided by the life expectancy and those are the amounts that we need to put in reserves we don't have there the things we have other than our ambulances are at the at and beyond the end of their life which three were the three that you said the scba replacement the other one i forgot what it's called and the ems it's the one that doesn't have a line item assigned to it oh okay you don't have that yet yes so those those are very important for us to start planning now so we don't have to be in such a key to debate when the time comes to replace them or have to take a large loans like we did to start the service because that's a recurring expense but if we save a little bit like we all just talked about the library big think ahead and save a little bit now it's it's less we're going to have to spend i totally understand what you're saying and i will do work with you guys however you want me to run the budget i presented you the budget at the minimum amount that's safe from the department so i will take whatever suggestions you guys want and we will do that but just just remember if we cut those i will be coming to you not not very long from now and telling you i need a 500 000 fire truck because ours can't get out of the bay and we can't get the one behind it though because the front one's broken so where's you got a maintenance budget right right so do you maintain these equip pieces of equipment as i mentioned i mean we do we have a maintenance budget we're at our business and we maintain our equipment and we've got loaders that are still working and your stuff doesn't go out half as much as mine does especially in the winter and there's got to be some place there where that maintenance budget and shouldn't be able to take care of this stuff for a while so that this reserve does not have to be so high so the price of one fire truck is 400 hundred and seventy five thousand for public paper and if we were to get a grant for that we would have to match that by forty five percent which means we would have to have two hundred and thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars in the in the reserve and we currently only have seventy six thousand seven hundred and eighty four dollars with fire truck replacement so when we talk about maintenance budget as three at least three of you remember from last year we talked about why we can't cut the maintenance budget if you look at your chart you'll see it's the same as last year and we talked about how inflation is astronomical i'm going to spend my entire maintenance budget this year which means that next year i'm going to spend it all and not have enough we do the best we can to maintain the things we have that's why they're still currently running and i haven't come to you and said i need a 500 000 400 000 fire truck but i want you all to remember other than our ambulances every other piece has been the power trucks so that and the ambulances and the power trucks are the only two pieces of equipment that are still inside their expected working life the only reason we can still use them is because the department was a volunteer department so there's a required by law of things we have to do with the trucks testing them using them it's different for a part-time for a volunteer department versus a career department when we move to korea it's a lot more use and testing of the truck and that is required by law we can't not do it so that it we're not going to get the same usage out of new trucks as we did with the ones we have now because they're going to need to be checked more often and used more often and if that had been done all along you might have gotten ahead of some of the problems that have come up now so we do have a maintenance budget we do maintain the best we can which is why i'm not asking you for faster than that on the dollar for a brand new fire truck but i am asking you to think ahead so i don't have to ask you for 500 and how much did you say it's currently in the reserve 76 784 dollars okay um yeah and honestly i hate asking these questions but everybody seems to have a complaint about the budget so somebody's going to try and figure out a solution and if i have to ask these questions i'm sorry but it has to be on yourself yeah i'm gonna question you i was just curious about somebody i just mentioned a few minutes ago there's a um are there outstanding loans um um on the ambulance on the ambulance um and what is the total amount i know that we have is it reflected in this this uh or is this our repayment we plan on the next couple of years or is that reflected as like total repayment in here over the next year or two it's owned to lease and that's our these are payments these are our payments so what's the outstanding loans amount that we have on top of this that if we were to pay it off if we had cash we could you know what would be the outstanding total well we don't normally do that because that's why we're here having these conversations that if we were to if we could have paid for those outright and not had to have done that we would have but we just simply in 2019 could not afford or or wanted to raise the mill rate enough to to make that happen well but then this would be a low reflection right i mean because there's an outstanding loan amount that would be i mean not reflected in a clean budget for the year i'm just wondering what those numbers are um for you okay cool so so there's a hundred thousand dollars here says fire truck replacement is that for fire truck uh bumper or tanker or what is that it's for any truck that needs beer quick question cody your figurative number 500 000 that you were used that is new with a life expectancy of 30 of the 30 years okay if you purchase a it's kind of a custom cap but everyone thinks that it's a fire truck correct those are probably 375 000 correct yeah right okay i don't know i just need to ask but do you guys have any like recommendations because i feel like i'm asking a lot of questions and there's a lot of like stuff that goes on and talk that goes on but nobody else has recommendations so i just need to maybe advise report something yeah but that like was stated i mean they don't have a lot of time either so i've got to figure something out if i could comment on that janet made a comment of the maintenance and cody mentioned that on the volunteer department the trucks sit there and you made mention that your trucks are out constantly which i see your trucks constantly a truck sitting there sometimes is its own worst enemy okay dad's truck firefighter's daughter here that's trump has not moved out of fire station number two in madawaska in over six months when they went to go look at it it had the hardest time starting there's the maintenance card that comes in when all those are sitting we need to get them out i'm moving and keep them running then you're looking at your fuel expenses well it doesn't take that long to get them out and running and rip back them back in just to get the fuels running through them right you've got it cracking and all that because they're being used correct yeah somebody's on duty they're not using that truck they should be doing something so that's that's what dc was referring to they have uh weeklies and dailies that they have to do by law every day so those vehicles that we currently have are vehicles that were part of the volunteer paid on call and that's why they are so outdated and beyond their use because they did sit for periods of times for years sometimes before they were for 19 so that's the issue that we're running into is that we have vehicles that um they're past their life use for safe safety reasons but we're still using them the best that we can with the maintenance budget that we have in order to make sure that they are functioning for our staff to be able to do their services now is there a refurbishing outfit that does fire trucks that can refurbish them you can't refurbish a commercial cab uh you can refurbish a custom cap and they can remount and update it but when it comes to a commercial pad you're talking about just taking the body off and putting a new chassis underneath it and it's at that point it's almost the same price as buying a new commercial cap one because i'm sure you all heard about firefighting foam and how unhealthy it is for people it's also unhealthy for the truck and when it sits again with a volunteer department that only is required to check it monthly those foam systems break down and start leaking into the truck and that starts deteriorating the whole truck so it's uh it has been made in the back mentioned that sitting is the worst thing for it and unfortunately when you have a volunteer department you can't get over to it every day like like what be able to do now and we're doing the best we can to try to fix those things that come up the problem is when we got those trucks they weren't they had budget issues then too i guess it's the best way to talk to address that so we took something that was maybe closer to the bottom of the barrel and we've used it beyond its life you can't really refurbish something that was never intended to be refurbished because it was bottom of the barrel to start with um again they've been useful trucks we've gotten there servant expected service life on them we're continuing to use them as best we can and use our maintenance measures to keep them going but it only feels so long before there's critical failures that are just so cost costly that it doesn't make any sense to make them repair kevin did you have something that no i have a question we've heard term by wall a couple times what law are you talking about made bureau of labor bureau of labor regulates your equipment your labor regulates our required equipment checks so every time there's a bureau of labor stand at evaluation we have to show them the records of our daily checks of our weekly checks they'll pick random employees and ask them to perform a daily or weekly check for them on whatever piece of equipment they want whether that be a fire apparatus or a breathing apparatus they'll pick up right excuse me pick any employee that's random to demonstrate those skills and then they'll come to us to show them the paperwork that shows that we mentioned safety works i was just curious because euro labor does not sound like someone that's done the deal with ems well yes this is fire related anything ems related is required by ems rules and and the law of that work but but each one of those services and bureau labor does do some things with ems but aems is the governing board for anything related to ins and maine ems is part of the state domain correct they are the governing agency of every ems service in the state of native licensing thank you tab number seven thank you uh you must be excited and counselors please remember as things change um as new um information is given to us from the people that we get our fuel from that we get sense like all these things they change um until we get to the point where we have to vote on budget and it is what it is at that point and we have to do the best to project where those costs are going to be i really hope that we see a decrease in fuel gas but i'm not certain that's going to happen since at 6 29 right now would be projected to be over seven by next month now the vehicle fuel in lubricants is that for just highway is that for all the departments for the police department uh to the evening council the amount that you see in our budget is for our department alone okay um that does include maintenance for the fuel system that's that's all under us um i just did a four year average uh we use 25 000 gallons of fuel some years it's been as high as 29 some years as low as 21 but it averages that was pretty easy um we averaged it at five dollars a gallon we're currently over that the majority of what we use is diesel um [Music] you know we're seeing projections of possibly over seven dollars a gallon throughout the summer you know i'm really hoping that it averages that back closer to five but at twenty five thousand uh gallons that's just a real world number there's so your parts repairs access on your freight uh that number um you're comfortable with that number uh to me to me in the works that i do um that number is kind of scary it could be not scary high scary level the way things are going uh counselors i'm not comfortable with any of them no it's just it's uh we're in non-chartered right you know something as simple as a brake rotor that we were getting last year for fifty dollars but right now a hundred yes uh you know we do have some flexibility there we have some parts on hand we've saved our used trucks so we could rehash every part that we have uh we're pretty resourceful when it comes to that um i i don't feel great with the number but i i i do feel that we can make that work we can get through yes sir that's all we're doing i have to agree with you i know numbers when it comes to this stuff too and to me it seems a little bit low now we've had that discussion and again this is why we have reserves right you know like we don't know what's going to happen in the very near future we've got some global issues that are really affecting what's going on today you know hopefully in a few months things will moderate you know we hope isn't going to get us through but um we it's again why we have reserves we can dip into that if we really get into a crunch you know it's like uh tommy and i had talked the other day you know it uh it's irresponsible to under budget but you also never want to go into a budget planning for 50 inflation i mean that's irresponsible as well because our budget's just gonna keep right skyrocketing it's a tough situation so looking at your parts and repairs for like your 2021 budget that's been moderate to be accurate not much yeah it's really changed the majority of the changes as you know it has taken place in the last two or three months yep if you if there's anything on that that is really low is paying reserves i don't get my sidewalks again this year a real number for paving reserves right now would be somewhere between 800 000 and a million dollars a year to get us back where we need to be and then the real number after that would be depending on paving costs around four to five hundred thousand a just keep our keep ourselves in a 10-year rotation the the council has heard over years past that that they were on a 10-year rotation you have 80 miles of road you have to pay eight miles a year to be on a 10 year rotation was just as simple as that and if you look back through history the town has paid 0.29 0.59 miles that's that's not a dead near rotation how many miles do we have here 81. we don't have our paving reserves is that 225 225 000. we should be like 800 000. yeah i've recommended the last eight years every year that we we put away a hundred thousand i think we got uh seventy thousand one year um majority of the years has been around thirty to thirty five thousand hasn't kept it and again what we would have done three years ago at 68 dollars a time this year is going to be north of 100 oh yeah so doing anything this year although the roads need it carefully would be irresponsible no i can't pick on anything on that budget that you've got it's uh very well written and thank you thank you first so hmm there's only one reserve line for this one is that correct yes um i did not request the additional reserves for admin reserves undesignated any of those this year our admin reserves has 257 323 dollars left i mean if we were on schedule with that we should put twenty five thousand dollars yeah that's great but we're only asking for ten thousand okay you um so admin includes town office town clerk code enchantment assessing tax collector community development did we add another person to the town first we did yep full time [Music] and the education and training line is accurate for that new training powers [Laughter] so we are doing and taking as many of those trainings on free and online and so that we are not sending any of our staff to augusta okay yeah there are a few that have i mean mma makes us pay for that that's good because we are members of mma um and there is a lot of supplemental trainings that they can do as well sometimes yes it's not what we would like to do but considering for this year we thought it was best to stay inside okay nope just checking this time the general is that what you expect out of your expenditures or is that the actual general assistance budget so yes so we um that is what we see generally okay um we don't anticipate i mean even during cobra we didn't have any jump in um yes i suspect yeah yes that's that's nothing this one okay so if we move on to the same tab the festival expense and then your income is directly behind it so you'll notice that the income has increased from last public budget carry to this one we went through the director and i um we went through currently what we already have that has come in and we were able to base that off of the projected budget for because if you remember our festival falls in between two budget years so it sort of gives us a little better idea of where we're at for the following year do you know what the reserves on this one are used for uh yes so we this year we use them for the picnic tables next year is the anticipation of the staging and cheryl william our director was able to get us all of the umbrellas for the picnic tables were speaking of the festival for the direct department we have already started the process of the fundraising for the playground we have found a donor for the tickets that you will be purchasing to raise funds with figra and we're doing a potato ground guess how many potatoes are in there so those have been donated by the blackstone farmhouse kyle bust nice so just to be nitpicky yeah the budget um the only thing that i see is i know it's like a special year for the festival but we have an increase of four thousand dollars on fireworks so just i mean our fireworks are always really really nice that's actually and so last year um we didn't do the full amount in that year we separated it out so it's actually the the amount was seventy thousand seven thousand so it's a thousand dollar increase okay and it's more reflected but we were still working off of code okay so that's why it looks like great that that's a little bit more it is what years reasonable yeah the rate increase went up wasn't caught first year okay so now we have to catch it so budget is 3775 expense minus income so we our income exceeds our expenses they haven't heard sponsors correct and that income number may change even before the may council meeting so we we updated it no no accidents you know there's not a lot of money there's not a lot of net dollars coming out of taxpayers generally what we try to do is make sure that the income festival is um and in this year it is very difficult to make that happen uh but we are still striving to do that so cheryl is still seeking out sponsorships so what's the full cost of that staging is it the 10 000. so you know the original uh cost this past past year when we ordered it was 16 000 and we have in the reserve account 409.78 currently um but that was uh before coding and then our product never showed up thankfully they never charged us for it so um and that was a little over 16 000 then um but now you can sign up to 24 5 for the same staging just two years later and it's staging that can be used for all different things not just for classical that's why we looked at it the rec department can use it um we're waiting though um so tab eight other expenses and unclassified our other expenses would be community center which is our heating oil and our coal utilities building repairs and the bond payment this is our last year set a question yes tom okay did i hear kevin mentioned earlier that there was repairs being done on this department budget or was it is that coming from the community say again um did i hear kevin said earlier that repair money was coming from the rec department budget to repair steps up front no i think you you really can't conversation okay so this is two different sets of monies to fix the steps did i miss something nope go ahead we've made a recommendation that each department that shares this building puts away five thousand dollars a year into a reserve account to help to fund the maintenance of the building we have fire departments that has certain needs pd that has certain needs right okay thank you so there's four you have four different requirements town office budget correctness that is correct so we're putting 20 000 away from the building we do this joint bill yes and we have a roof that leaks every year um and we know that we're getting close to the point where that will have to be um not repaired but redone um and so we're incrementally putting aside for that but the cost of materials and labor continues to go up we may have to get a bit more aggressive uh 23 24 24 25. these steps out here as well yeah so this section that we're in right now was the part that was built on and then of course the armory section over here and then putting the race unfortunately this the new section had no underlayment there's no ice water shield or anything so every time you get a just a small ice dam build up which we do we have leakage and i suspect when we peel the roof off to have it replaced we'll see damage oh okay chief you see regularly and we were going to speak to aws about i did we have we have come to a definite agreement and understanding that yes that income level has to be raised and it's reflected in not in the insurance is going up 30 000 yes sir okay so um any questions on the unclassifieds the outside agencies i'm gonna change so uh okay any questions so if you want to um again we can look at the consolidated expenses on tile 11. i just like to go here consolidated expenses um the first information that was shared this evening with the budget amounts so what you're looking at here with um including all total unclassifieds and other expenses all total expenditures would be seven million eight hundred thirty five thousand one hundred and thirty four dollars we are asking for reserves of 510 000 for a total of 8 million 345 134 and again that includes the um the 2 million and 203 two dollars from the school and the two hundred and seventy seven thousand two hundred nine dollars from the county and that's what gives us that total and then our revenues are six million three hundred twenty five thousand nine hundred eight dollars so that's what leaves us the excess of the two million next two thousand [Music] and this covers everything the nfc 20 you got 22 22 million how does that mean is what the school will be um asking for at their budget meeting next week is thursday that's the school boards though find what and the state recommends so in order for the school to receive their funds from the state we have to put our portion of that in and that is the 1 199 781.66 they in order to receive their the additional 4 million thirty eight dollars and six hundred five hundred thirty eight thousand six hundred seventy three dollars and forty six cents which is seventy nine percent of the one hundred percent of the eps for the school we we have to find it's state law we have to fund that we do not we can't do anything about that whatever that comes to that's what we have to find the difference is that they have an excess in order to fund their budgets and that's the additional that they're asking for from us that makes up the two million two hundred and three thousand four hundred and thirty two dollars so they're they're asking more than what the state would recommend they're they're asking yes to fund their budget right what what their budget comes to similar to our budget they need the additional amount from the town to to fund that budget to make that budget work for them and the town has to pay that amount if they've voted if it's voted on right and that's not the vote that's coming no school board or school board's proposal next week that would be the budget here oh i was thinking like the school's budget that they're voting on and may i ask you a question do you hear that the legislature is funding the 55 or 100 so they are so that would be why they are only because if you run the numbers it actually comes out to 2 million one dollars and 804 four cents so there's six hundred thousand nine hundred and forty nine dollars and fifty percent that the state is also going to fund for the school if we do our part and pay into the school so um rather than hand us a bill for two million eight hundred and four thousand three hundred eighty one dollars it's two million two hundred and three thousand four hundred and thirty two dollars you can ask for the uh the additional local that the school has asked for mr dope can provide that to you and see what that has been over the last few years yes and i i had last year's and this year's in this particular yeah so so the school needs when is the school budget meeting the school board meets on the 10th to make their decision i don't know i don't believe that we'll probably set that hearing date sorry usually in june actually i think he's going to try to do it sooner than that will be made any questions on that no okay and so 11 is the consolidated income and you'll notice there's a few changes there additional changes um and it also counselors have been stated that the municipal revenue sharing is anticipated to be fully funded at the five percent uh instead of two and a half percent the increments the two and a half percent than the three percent and five percent they they agreed to the five percent um but that number that you're looking at there the nine hundred and five thousand eight hundred and seven dollars is not it's not really a permanent number until september and sometimes even in october it's changed but that's it's it's not funny yet that's that's the number they gave us in march i check it like a stop any questions on income um the um council has no more questions um the next uh time we'll meet about the budget um will be the may council meeting may 18th at 6 pm here in chambers um if this budget was accepted that's defended here tonight and we're looking at a two million dollar deficit my first question is today this is a tony question again okay but today what does one mill raise so we can't give that but today's year today how much money does one male raise 185 yes thank you if you know i know that well because you and i both knew that um if that be the case and we're looking at a two million dollar deficit and i'm going to do rough math in my head that says about 10 mils no today just i'm trying to get a handle on what we're talking about the numbers if i could yeah based on today's mill what it raises and if you let's take a look at a 10 mil for instance we're looking at less than two million dollars being raised today using today's mill numbers okay and i think it was stated earlier that the state will only allow us to raise so many mills per year so let's say that the the state says you know we you can't raise 10 mills that's too much and this budget is already approved the mill rate is not set until october and all of a sudden we're able to raise 25 nils and we need that additional money to make up the difference in deficit is there a plan as to where that money is going to come from at this time so that's not quite how that how that works um so again like i said the municipal tax rate calculation standard form comes from the state that changes every year so your mill for this fiscal year does not match your mill for next year period it just doesn't unless everything stays exactly the same we would be looking at 19 and a half mils we would be looking at the same numbers nothing would change but because everything changes from year to year so rough calculations which is what i said last meeting last week when it was said that we'd be raising it by 31 mils that was the statement that was made that's that i can't imagine anybody having a memory over 40 ml anyway i mean that would be an excessively expensive attack however um in running those numbers based on the state and all the information that we have if nothing changes moving forward to june i mean we could be looking at a 26 mil rate at the high end of the melees not 31 not 42 not 50 which is also been stated so that's that's where that lies and it's doing a rough calculation in your head versus all of the information that you have in order to configure a mill rate a lot of things get left out when you're doing that so there are things that are taken into place here taxable valuation exempt value homestead betty statutory standard reimbursements there's county tax municipal appropriation tip financing local education total assessments anticipated state municipal revenue sharing all other revenues and then it's all calculated into a formula by the state and that and i could i do math quite well and i could never do this in my head it's a formula that comes directly from the state so when you have an excess that is your that's your taxes that's your tax money being used to to help supplement those costs um and so that's that's what that comes from so the statement how do you plan to pay for that um it is paid for in taxes that's that's why we do this this is why we we have the budget hearings and why we discuss budget for many months many weeks many months prior to council voting on the budget in june um that's where that money comes from and council will they have a lot to decide on now that they've heard all the information now that they've seen everything that's presented to them from county from the school and from the municipal side of it um the may council meeting is where they really start looking at and deciding on where to move forward where to cut back where to you know what to find what not to find that's where that decision process gets taken into account because a lot changes between now and when the june council meeting comes to and then from june to september um once we've even already set the budget there's things that change at the state level as well i'm hopeful that they will change for the better for us um just given the discussion of the legislature level and their willingness to find a lot of things that they they have been pulling back on because of copen um and now they're willing to fund because of pulpit so um i this is not permanent this is of course what we've presented um and again we'll have lots more discussions on what that looks like moving forward um but yeah it's it's just saying you know 185 000 and then and doing the millwright that way it it really isn't supplemental to what we do with the fun the formula that comes from the state so it changes um i mean it changes here we don't have the uh taxable valuation yet we don't have any of that stuff so those numbers are going to change here as well that's why i do not like to give a predictive mill rate when we do this in may and june because that that will change based on the numbers that we get back from the state so but currently right now if everything stays where it's at what's been presented that that would be the highest but that won't cover it i mean i mean it would have to go up the year after because this thing will only allow us to go up so much right no according to the state that this more than covers we would have an overlay of 264 933.89 and you always want an overlay when you do your mill range so that you don't run into the risk of having to do a supplemental tax bill there's a little bit of a misstep and the tongue way it was presented the form that we get for the municipal calibration form is presented by the state based on information provided by the state and the local being done it gives you a maximum amount and a minimum amount yield from the mill rate but there's no magic number that says we can only go up two mils or we can line up four minutes right it tells you what your maximum is and what your bottom is if you have a readout like you did right we bought them up seven nils 70 belts i misunderstood because i thought the statement was that we could only raise our mill rate a certain amount of maximum that that mill rate is basically a town's valuation dropped three zeros does that typically raise one mill each year well yes thank you but one no for fair value but correct the issue is 3.7 million of what we paid this year in taxes as a whole pound and that's going to go up to about five point five point uh uh eight right um so so so i mean the the overall amount that each individual person is going to have to pay goes up a huge percentage it has to regardless of what the mill rate is and how land is valued in the uh the magic number system you know the state number system it's still going up but like like a giant percentage right because we because it says right here it was 3.7 million is what we collect in taxes and this year with the two million dollar shortfall it's going to be our 2.1 million shortfall it's going to be that much more so yeah there would be some some flexibility but that still means right i mean taxpayers are going to pay that much more unless like we've got a wall right so um to break that down even further for you this year uh commitment for us is three million six hundred twenty six thousand nine hundred and forty two dollars at nineteen and a half mills based on um the final budgets the uh county tax was 267 267 563 the schools was two million one hundred forty two thousand three hundred and eighty five dollars and the municipal cards the municipal portion of that three point six million was one million two hundred and sixteen thousand nine hundred and ninety four dollars which if you look at mills and that's what a lot of people look at the school would be 11.52 mills the town will be 6.54 mills and the county would be 1.44 mills what percentage of that 2.1 million then would be you don't know that that's the word well uh of the total of the mill rate last year 59.0 percent of zero sum percent went to the school msa yes right oh you mean for fiscal year 23 yeah yeah can't break that down yet and so we have final numbers from the school and final numbers from the town but it looks like roughly like like oh okay i want to thank everybody unless anybody else has anything to add um we'll we'll make it work we'll make it work we've got a lot of good people on it and i feel with the effort we can we can all put this together and make it work for another year well thank you everybody for showing us and we'll meet again at our next council meeting anybody else need a sign yeah well i'm lost now and that's too many already,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,3Zzn8OlcJ10,"1st Budget Public Hearing April 28, 2022",,94.0,5630.0,2022-04-29T00:59:11Z,none,139,1,0,0,well i i i look down at this first page i won't say it's 21 22 but it is we'll change that to 22 23 and i knew that by the way but anyway and uh along with this i'm sure there'll be a lot of questions hopefully we have the answers uh we've we've had a couple weeks going over what we've uh had and it's still uh a lot to review that we have left to do but i uh i know we'll like i say we'll try to get the answers that we have and if we don't we'll see to it that their town manager would have them or we can get the answers also we have our budget committee present i think if we could get a raise of a hand to see who was here tonight that's on this new budget committee to aaron back in the corner three uh is there any that so four all right so i'm sure with information that uh they have and and we together can look at what we're considering for budgets and work through this and and hopefully make this work for everybody at this time we move on to what you have i know code enforcement tax assessor and committee development but i didn't know if you wanted to uh just have uh i know a lot of people traditionally this is a this is a work session for the council right um and so it's my responsibility to present the budget um so i'm not really sure what you're asking me to do well no basically i i know a lot of people just picked up the budget uh i don't know how much time you've had to review it uh any abuse if there's any questions going in we can just start and uh or do you want to present well i would just like to reiterate that this is just a draft this is not the actual proposed budget that's right this is the numbers as they come into us based on what it costs to run the services for the community and everything is you know up for discussion for sure as it always has so yes gary if i may yes you may gary he told me that it could be opportunity to ask questions but first let me make some observations the proposed budget as presented tonight provides for a deficit of two million dollars two million dollars equates to what a mill rate roughly 31 31 mills adrian i don't have that ever you have you're right yeah well calculating it out it's around 31 mils from 95 to 31 mils if you have docked this budget i don't know who wants to pay that kind of money but i should total expenditures on this proposed budget is a million dollars more than last year it's a lot of money and i'm not going to go into the different departments because some departments are fairly close some departments are way off but a million dollars then of course revenue was down the other million dollars we're talking two million dollars here for a small personally i don't think we can afford that and you five as counselors have a responsibility to the rest of us citizens to hold that so that our taxes don't go up dramatically and i hope you can do that i suggest i have suggested to some of you that you charge the account manager with the responsibility of bringing this budget in line with a percentage increase of whatever you think is reasonable and she has the responsibility going different departments and getting that decrease to keep the taxes in line only she can do that she has charge of all the department heads when i look at the different department heads i see substantial increases in this budget i'm not smart enough to know which is right which is wrong all i know is that the total the total expenditures exceed expenses and income by 2 million dollars small town 2 million is a lot of money and i implore you as counselors to charge your manager with the responsibility to bring that budget back in line thank you very much thank you gary are you ready chairman okay um if you break down the um consolidated expenses uh county tax is 277 277 209 we don't have our numbers from the school administrative district yet so i have used last year's number which is two million one hundred forty two thousand three hundred and eighty five dollars and the municipal share of that is five million nine hundred and twenty five thousand five hundred and forty dollars we bring in an income of six million three hundred twenty five thousand nine hundred and eight dollars so you subtract our income from our municipal part that we're responsible for this budget that you're looking at because you have to remember that what we have to present to you is not just the municipal budget but also include the school's budget which we have no control over and the county tax budget which we have no control over that would actually leave us with an overlay of four hundred thousand three hundred and sixty eight dollars the county tax and the school administrative district also have incomes that come in and what they send to us for a bill is above what they bring in for revenue so we are responsible the municipality is responsible for making up their difference their deficits so our actual income the 6 million 325 908 more than covers what the municipality is asking for which is 5 925 540 so it is very daunting when you look at that and i understand that because it gets very confusing if you do not understand municipal budgets and you do not understand where these numbers come from or what their food but if you read on the left hand side the back page of the consolidated expenses you will see the county tax and the school administrative district is also in there and you have to subtract those from the actual final budget for what the municipality is actually responsible for and that has a lot to do with when we give out the percentage of where the money is coming from where it's going to on your tax bill when you receive your tax bill it tells you um twice what's broken down and just last this past year's tax bill with the mill rate of 19.5 the county was responsible for 7.38 of the tax bill uh the school was responsible for 11 uh 59.07 of the tax bill and the town was only responsible for 33.55 of the tax bill so i think sometimes when we have these conversations about budget it often gets confusing when you don't remember that you have to remove the school and the county tax from that bottom line so yes it shows a deficit of the 2 million 19 000 and change but we have to remember that that's not all on the municipality you have to the county tax and the school administrative district are added into that final number so it's important to remember that when we have these discussions tonight over each individual department's budget now you this is the third presentation that i've given to council so you know that this is a process and this isn't the final numbers but these are the numbers that are coming into us and it is irresponsible of us not to inform you of what those costs are and the rise in the costs um just yesterday fuel was um 400 and was like 404.70 a gallon today is 5.40 just in less than 24 hours for fuel so we have to keep in mind that changes are happening all around us and yes we are going to be as responsible as we possibly can be with those numbers but we also have a responsibility to the citizens to provide those services for them and it's important that we let council know what those actual costs are so we don't get in a situation where and traditionally council does not put contingency funds away for these types of situations um council uses reserve accounts for their capital funding there's no we do not go after large sums of money from our municipality in order to provide for these capital funding projects so we are a reactive community versus proactive in the sense that we don't have the funds set aside for these types of inflation rates so we are giving you real-time numbers for what we're finding so as we go into each one of these departments you'll see um with code enforcement tax tax assessor and community development they don't um theirs doesn't really change from year to year to here he has a set of expenses that are in line with what needs to be done really any uh changes would be for training state fees that so none of that has really changed for total does anyone have any questions on the assessing code enforcement community development those numbers have not changed from the last presentation they're the same numbers ready to move oh no this is just okay yeah if you got anything stand right up uh mr dorsey i got a couple items they haven't been brought up yet but it's a good time to bring it out when we're looking at tax revenues our largest taxpayer free energy hasn't paid its tax three or four years it amounts to about 462 000 and i suppose we had the fines and probably 25 30 000 a year anyway i talked to hell about it and they don't seem to be too interested in accepting some kind of a compromise payment with them they've merged with another company last april they've kind of changed their their program around a little bit so my question i guess is what what do we do we're carrying forty two thousand four hundred and sixty two thousand dollars on an accounts receivable current council sql that accounts receivables on current are cash bank uh deposits and so forth when you get into a credit problem it's no longer a quick asset it's got to be out of there now i don't know if they're going to make arrangement for this year and i don't know what effect they'll have on your budgets but it represents a hell of a chunk of money and they didn't pay their tax so i don't know if it goes back against paraded over several several years older taxes or it goes on in our capital because you've got to remember three of you the last two years you when you talk about budgets to actual you overspent your budget 1.3 million dollars it's right in your annual report right and last year you spent over a million dollars so you you've lost 2.2 million dollars out of our capital the the value and it's in your report so i guess i'm i've been getting sticky about your budgets is that because when i get this budget today at the increase i didn't know whether somebody's either smoking something wrong or drinking water but i mean i'm a banker 40 years on budget nobody's going to put that but i don't care how many department heads you have if you just said listen i'm drawing the line to ten percent plus it's actually necessary yes whatever it is but anyway i'm getting off a little because i i just couldn't get over this one what what happens three energies debt to us to the taxpayer how how when do you take it off your asset and reduce it because it's a credit problem are you asking me yeah somebody i don't know so there's there's actually a few options that we are working with um the auditors to ask them what is the best situation for the town but the this council not this particular council but the fourth paragraph town council has carried uh an over 100 thousand dollar debt on farm park for very like a very long time um and they can't get results well i've asked to have it look when we start looking at bottom line so what you need to run this place we better start looking at a lot of other ious look what gets me is this i'm retired so i'll go wrong but look at the people in this town we're not a commercial town we don't have a manufacturing it's a retirement bedroom community a lot of people on fixed incomes and now they're hitting with all kinds of expenses so i guess i get a little bit testy but when i see somebody up here with a big increase in the department head i'm saying maybe they won't be able to get along without that a little bit anyway the other thing i'd like to throw out it would really be helpful to everybody i had it for years when you compare budgets if you compare budgets to actual because right now we're looking at this budget we've already experienced nine months so we know what the actual is so it's pretty easy to look look we're in line we're okay if we if those expenses are legit they'll show up i know it's hard for you to do that but there must be a way to simplify this and take this thing out of it for everybody if we see our gas and up then it goes up right that so um i think you mean year-to-date spent for this particular fiscal year is that what you're talking about versus actual i was looking at an actual this year 20 20 years spent um is different from actual actual municipal is the end of the fiscal year so what was actually spent versus budgeted and year-to-date spent which is what you have for your reserve reserve accounts that was requested and the new information that handed out to you and so that is a year-to-date spend um but if you would like to see that i mean i look at those every month do you see what i mean though if you're a numbers guy looking at it and you go down and they're there they're there i mean don't argue it's there that's right when you start looking at i kept looking at my last year budget and i said well i i know it's there but i don't know how we actually made out and i won't know so we ran into an issue with our accounting uh trio as well um we used to have a button at the end of the year that gave us all of our actuals that we could go back to and they stopped doing that in 2019. so we have to research all of our information it's not at the touch of a button anymore it has to go we have to go back through all of the paperwork in order to get that information but we are working on that to make sure we have that uh getting back to re-energy do we get any kind of a better i call it kickback they're reimbursement from the state like you wouldn't your home's betting okay uh betty under the energy it doesn't amount to anything free energy is not currently taxed and have been for three years so that's out there they weren't getting anybody in either because they were exempt as a utility they couldn't qualify for anything i just was digging around looking at that uh i the hope time that we get together that somebody really does a job at this uh i hope that you go to the school board meetings do the same thing there as well they haven't really moved around much i can't seem to pick it down but i when i look down here and i ran the percentages this afternoon and i'm not picking on anybody i just look at things that stick out you get a recreation department that will not 56 increase 100 000 bucks well you have to remember though last year because of covet we didn't really have a rent apartment so we we went after them hard last year and we have a full functioning department again this year i'm looking at a million two over okay and with times the way they are i i don't think that though we want to live with that and you've really gone here you you you've been through this you've been short on your budget for two years also able to decrease our taxes last year if i'm correct i only look at the expenses i just look at this and you're adding a report it says revenue and in the last year your revenue was 5 million nine hundred thousand and you spent six hundred and nine you spent a million dollars more than your revenue that's in your your report so i didn't manufacture that did i no but you're i can't but you're pulling information that doesn't really have any it doesn't have an effect on the actual final numbers we have not been below budget at all since i've been here but at the end of the fiscal year when we close out at budget well then you want to have gisele change that around that has a lot to do with capital versus actual numbers so capital capital versus actual numbers is not the same thing and as i said at the beginning council traditionally does not budget capital expenses higher than what we should be doing to make sure that that and those numbers that you see there change but as our capital decreases correct our cash flow shortage increases and we we've got low we're we're cash low we're low we're stretched have traditionally happened is not our cash flow capital money is not in municipal it's what it's worth it's worth its worth but you also have to remember we have a brand new department that has a lot to do with that yeah that department's very expensive it saves lives sir yes well yeah i'm sure it does but i talked with the gentleman in mars hill trent ladine chairman of the council they started out with used vehicles it's going to cost less than 70 dollars per person next year but their service that they provide is not the same service but they do have about 3 000 people and it it's again it's the time to get to the person we jump right up here we started right now with the cadillac no we didn't know we didn't start out we started off with refurbished i get tired here we started with the best of the new stuff we could get you didn't spend that kind of money on refurbished if you i talked to the chairman town council preschool today and they told me this has got exactly what they bought now they're going to knew but they had used stuff they didn't spend that money they spent a million three last year we spent a million anyway i didn't mean to get off the subject but somehow you gotta type now okay i i agree with a hundred percent but uh i wanna give you some figures that we started with before and we went to the school department and i'm gonna i'm gonna relate to that on the school department last year she gave the figures so i figured out the last three years okay and we talked this i'm a senior citizen and i do look out for the safety of the people around and i look at the senior citizen in my last three years on my taxes alone i paid thousand two hundred and eighty seven dollars for school which i do not use okay well what we're saying i paid sell i paid eleven hundred dollars for services i do need okay so the services that i do need you want to cut that services that i do and you want me to pay more for the services i don't use no i don't want to cut i want to use it better and better utilization we have we have every department come under budget last year every department but this year's budget is substantially higher than last year well it's just a presented budget right now this is simplified mr chair yes i would like to remind you the purpose of this public hearing is not to debate it's not to discuss is to take comment no it's not it's for discussion theory discussion of the budgetary let tony speak thank you this is a published public hearing to receive comment it's not to debate but not put on the seat to debate or answer questions or be put in hard spots is to receive comments about the proposed budget and it is just proposed has been stated by the talent manager is subject to change several times before it is adopted which is not going to happen until the summer meeting so again keep you on track the point of order here is is a public hearing yes gary it is a public hearing and you've been in that position before i've asked the chairman if we could ask questions he said yes we could therefore but not debated yeah both of you were debating with them trying to get an answer out of them pointing out the facts tony i'll just bring you back to the yes what the purpose of this hearing is thank you and if you'd like to go get the notice to read it thank you so uh at this time we're we're all looking at changes and and to move forward it's it's it's going to be it's going to be tough and i think that we we can make we can make budgets work this year provide applicable service for everybody in our community and we can put this behind us but we're we're we're not going to gain ground by uh looking at what we have in front of us it's just a projected budget we had to start somewheres and to keep this which thank you tony in line um it's hard because a lot of you people haven't had a lot of time to review where we are on the budgets but let's try to keep this civil and and look at uh some concerns and uh move this meeting along and and hopefully uh we can all learn from it okay the library so council gave the directive to have the librarian find out the slate roof repair and what that would be and she has placed that in there for you and we also have had the request based on our insurance provider for liability we can't have uh entities using the different buildings in the community like the library town office uh any of those places without staff present so this also reflects adding an additional 20 hour a week person for that so that people can use the community room excuse me are you saying that community functions can be used there at the library if there is a staff person present yeah anyway you've added 20 hours a week to the staff for an additional person yeah so that if an organization wants to have a meeting there they can probably still do it if if we are allowed to do this yes yes thank you i had two different bad clubs reach out to me i'm just curious why you can't use some facilities but you can others a good example would be riverside park pavilion that doesn't have to be manned by an employee and people use that all hours and day and night why must the library now have a uh employee there at the time according to our insurance underwriters for liability purposes if you have employees who work in an area that is exactly what they are used for and they need to be present when you are in their facility whereas pavilion and puddle dog are not um i don't miss a man but they don't have step that are there they are just rentals as far as liability something should happen at one total lock or riverside after hours there's no conservative liability of course there's that's why we have liability insurance it's a little bit different yeah the the way that liability insurance works is if it's a manned facility then it's expected that when there's public there that there will be staff there where it's not a manned facility there's not normally staff there on a regular basis then the liability gives you different type of coverage so and it can't cross like you can't say well we have staff here part of the time but not the other part and be covered when there's not staff there it's either it is or it isn't so rather than having another staff there to fill this easy ending hours we can't have part of our liability insurance coverage is placed out for hours it won't allow if it's a normally a staffed facility then it has to be staffed in order for it to be used by the public so and that's that's just insurance that's not the town that's the way it is thank you ken so does any does council have any questions we're not making a decision on that at this point we're just discussing okay this is this is just the beginning there are no decisions right now tom did you have something tom told by the way when you're doing this presentation i assume you're going from top to bottom and we had talked about administration i know you talked a lot about tony's different hats and responsibilities but i have a question as to the administration line the town office line on top could you explain how or why it's going from there so this is going to take a really long time if we have to keep doing this and not allowing me to just go through the presentation with council and when we get to that point if you would like to ask a question about that i'd be more than happy to answer it i was just curious why you you skipped over that i don't think we know we wouldn't go over anything we're going through the book with the council yeah because if we just went through consolidated you wouldn't be able to hear any of the other outliers that we discussed right so thank you you're welcome thank you tom any more questions on the slate roof or any of that okay parks and rec so there are there's added information at the back of your parks and rep presentation which is on the other side of the budget itself and this was given by director smile to give you um information about the other communities prep island caribou just so you can see what they're doing and what their costs are and what they're putting their their funds into for that when you have a chance to go through theirs i would encourage you to see that and your numbers that you're seeing are very similar to the last presentation that we were given the slight increases that you're seeing in some of these budgets are due to fuel costs so [Applause] there's a lot of good information in there when you get a chance to take a look at it it's very very interesting what we are able to do the services that we provide to the right department i mean i've reviewed each of the different departments budgets and kind of gone through and looked at any increases from last year versus you know what they're asking for this year rec department i mean the biggest chunk of increases is you know obviously we have another person so it's all within like salaries benefits retirement um pool maintenance was a a big increase but necessary there's um one-time increase though right yes because we are purchasing the maintenance right books and information and taking that over ourselves rather than having to pay that person every year right so and and another um substantial increase was like the wreck repair and maintenance again necessary um so you know i understand the increase but i think that it's pretty well justified on here that's my thoughts on that one so okay if you're ready to move on to the fire ems tab four so you will notice a change from the last presentation to this one significant change in health insurance um and then what we're asking for in the reserve side yes biggest increase in that department is for employees somebody tell me how many employees we have in that department yeah if council would allow me i'd like to make some comments on this before i can answer the ques questions right number number of employees is what i'm asking i would like to make some comments if i could yes i will answer the question so to start with i'd like you all to remember our first meeting we had about this budget when we talked about why our employee expenses were increasing so drastically or why we were asking them to when minimum wage went up two of our full-time employees needed to have their right their rate of pay increase because they were below minimum wage what we have done we have asked for the lowest paid person to make what a janitor at mcdonald's gets paid the lowest paid person has to be basic fire school training which takes six months must have an emt basic license which takes six additional months and is charged with saving lives for the same thing that the person who sweeps the floor mcdonald's makes so it's a significant increase all of the increase is not from adding additional employees it's from paying employees a rate at which they can live on and to be commensurate with the duties you all expect them to be able to perform there is no increase in the number of employees how many employees you have that's the question full-time or part-time both our total department is 25 people i have nine career staff myself and the chief how many partners the total staff is 25. i have nine full-time plus the chief and i have 14 14 part time part-time and pay call they're classified as the same you're telling me that that some of those employees were below minimum wage two full-time what is minimum wage today plus they now have to be compensated for one hour for every 40 hours that they work so again that's two full-time staff every part-time staff member makes minimum wage plus they get incentives for any education and training they have so every one of those 14 others had to have their wages increased as well but two career staff who do this as their only job had to have their rate of pay increase to be at minimum wage this council have any questions on any of the reserve that we're looking for um can you show me where the changes are from last so i'm not i'm seeing the same in this binder the same paper as i have from the last binder so i should make sure i'm looking at the right thing okay uh council i should be aware that i have put in for cbs funds the professional foundation spending for engine tanker thank you that does more than one job um and uh with sunder collins office so because we are working with very paged apartments that is not functioning that it should be is that a grant how long does that i don't know um usually it's after the first of july that we were here um from it's through usda rng so hopefully we are successful with that one because we need it very badly and that would help us greatly and strengthen our mutual rate good if we may while we're on that department yeah scary income for ems angular service fire department is the same as last year four hundred eight thousand dollars again i can get through all of this presentations when we get to those things then we can um entertain all those but we don't have our numbers yet from the bill so we have to use last year's numbers until we have the new numbers do you know when we'll be able to get an update as like year to date i know we're i know that the billing sometimes takes a while because we bill them but it's not necessarily paid so immediately right now our billing is submitting bills for december so i uh i update delegates the updated numbers every every time we get the information from usually once a month they have end of month totals but she's only working on december numbers so that it's hard for me to give you an accurate number now when we're still in december of last year versus nothing from this year so why is billing like like that why is it that structures it due to insurance and things like that well the vast majority of the time constraints is dealing with insurance everything has to be coded properly and the reason we chose this billing service is because when we get initially denied if we get initially denied they spend the extra time to figure out why we got denied appeal that and they're usually very successful at getting that money back for us problem is anything with the feds takes forever and i forget the exact percentage but i think it's something like 80 percent of our calls are paid by the federal government medicaid medicare and main care so we have to just wait a long time to get the money uh they're doing the best they can and it insurance takes a long time to pay ambulance isn't a money maker it's recuperating some of our costs right thank you um [Music] [Music] so i guess a comment on this one too for me would be um if there's a place that we can look because obviously all of the budgets we're going to have to look at different places we can um decrease so my suggestion would be in the reserves and i know that's a hard place to decrease because we decrease it now and we pay for it later and i completely understand that um but my thought process on that for this specific department is that once we can get some of those larger loans paid off would be when we could look to funding more heavily those reserve accounts it probably won't be the same for every single department but for this department that would be my recommendation stick to it if i could just comment on that sure um i understand what you're saying um i want to remind the council that contrary to what has been stated tonight here we did not buy all new things to start with the only things we had brand new were ambulances and if you ask anybody that actually works with an ambulance and presque isle they can tell you how great used ambulances are and how they last for maybe a year before you have to buy another used ambulance uh so when when it's time when these loans we have are paid off it will be time to take more loans to replace the things we have now our fire trucks are all well beyond their useful life our scba packs have a set time frame on we haven't saved for them at all and if you some of you may remember a few years ago we were in that same boat and had to come up with a large chunk of cash just so you know the price of those has already gone up one-third in three years so the amount that's in there for your pack replacement is just to have the amount of money we spent three years ago on air packs so just having that is still not going to be enough so it's it's very important that we think about the large purchases because the large purchases is what is causing a lot of the animosity at these hearings and if we keep pushing kicking the can down the road there's going to continue to be animosity and we don't want we're not we're not in cadillacs we're in 2002 honda civics with 300 000 miles on them duct taping them together trying to do the best we can so that's all i have to say thank you you know i i just like to say something i want to comment on what you just said you you've compared fort fairfield a couple times here tonight when you've gotten up there with four prairies nowhere near the size pressed down we don't have anywhere near the calls let's see how it does if i could comment on that presque isle fire has 18 full-time firefighter paramedics a deputy chief and a chief they have four ambulances we do not staff that we do not compare one of the other things mentioned earlier was comparing our budget if you look at their budget their actual total cost for fire and ems is more than double hours the way their budget is presented in presque isle is different than the way our budget is presented so the 1 million that was said earlier is what didn't get covered from ems billing so their budget is twice as much as ours because we don't have the call volume because we don't have the staffing it's a different department and i compare it because others have brought up the facts to compare us not because we're comparable because our goal here is to provide the best service in aroostook county thank you okay let's pd tab five i would just like to state one thing uh our police department uh actually is getting like renewed started up there's a lot of expenses we could be seeing this year because of where our pd was and where it had to start over so i i just want to let everybody know that you can almost look at this as a as a new department uh i think personally they've done a phenomenal job on what they've had to work with and so i just wanted everybody to keep that in mind so for the police department um you'll notice that the education and training has gone up significantly from last year to this year and that is because we have to send um one of our staff to the academy um eighteen thousand dollars to send an individual and to earn their blueprint and then the other significant increase you'll notice um is vehicle fueling and moves and that's because we have the staff working out to use the vehicles um which last year we did not so that's why you're seeing a significant increase there um the overall increase um in general is indicative of having almost fully staffed police department we are one officer may i ask how many officers you have now three three plus the two so the budget that proposed is including the three plus the g correct and um actually i think yeah that's added into the four and that is what council um any questions on the uh police department these numbers reflect the union contract that was agreed to for the three-year classroom and then the only other of course paving increase those costs fuel costs go up getting increased as well um the only other really that's the only significant increase the other increases that you've seen are because of the real-time costs that are going up for us directly asking some questions on what he's seeing for a cost it's hard to compare our last year's budget for this year's budget uh ours is purely driven by inflation we we stock up on our pipes this year's heights were bought last summer we'll do the same again this year um we've just got word that our the uh culvert increases are 75 percent wow so i mean we have some in stock which is a bit of a reserve but uh that's just that's just one item that we use um we haven't bought any yet we're still shopping around uh i assume we could have copied one of the major suppliers that we had uh shirtless and going out of business uh fuel our cost of fuel in the last two days has gone up seventy percent uh 70 cents yes yeah i just talked to uh i wish i could get a i just talked to uh uh somebody that owns and operates his own uh fuel and gas station and is at three o'clock this afternoon he paid now this is off the tank this is from the truck to him 6.29 a gallon for diesel at his facility i believe with the budget that i have three parties tonight mrs powers has presented you tonight that we will still have to curtail services in some way shape or form by late next week thank you yeah looking at the budget for public works i mean the biggest increase is just in the um again the benefits and salaries and stuff like that which was part of the union contract so there's really not much increase in this budget at all it's very very minimal uh tab number seven which is administration and festival so really our pledges decreases again the salaries and you'll also see in there um at the bottom and it's not any visuals so that you understand that that is also a part of it so when you see the quote enforcement assessing that that's all part of my budget as well with the administration but it's not in addition to the one that you were already presenting [Music] the town office budget was up 25 it's an additional staff i just yes i just said that the increases that you see are in the staff and the benefits the salaries but it's necessary to have extra staff especially with the amount that the staff are having to do um at this point in time uh they're fielding a lot of calls a lot of questions on you know the budget and things like that so they are doing additional um there's a lot of extra going on that they were not doing before um they're not dealing with the budget issues not dealing with those at all the staff still has to deal when people come into the office the staff has to answer questions when people call in the staff still has to direct calls to andrea there's a big increase in phone calls and staff work with them dealing with the controversy that's been going on over the budget so i mean am i incorrect in stating that your workload has increased know the workload has increased but it's we should also remember that we've been running short staffed for two years okay um we haven't had the staff that we should have had for the last two years because we were forced to make cuts and we're unable to do that and under the current budget that we have we are still able to to do that we stop some projects in order to be able to better service our citizens because ultimately that's really what this is about is the service that is provided to the citizens so um there are many times when in the past we have had one clerk out front and if you've ever been in here when it's busy and it's it's busy a lot that person can be standing there for four to five hours straight without a break because it's customer after customer after customer after customer so we yes we are a small town but we are a very busy high functioning small town so i mean it goes in waves but i mean we had staff who weren't they weren't able to take a vacation for a period because we were socially staffed yeah any other questions for admin okay tab eight which is your other expensive classified now um the council have questions on other expenses we're looking at insurance the community center this building here safety and sanitation which is a public fire street lighting street light repair aws any other [Music] you notice our workers comp has style where we were in 2020 to where we are 22 is quite a difference and these are these are costs generally that we don't have a say over um it's not like we can go in and say well we're just going to cut back on unemployment um insurance liability the bond all of those things these are costs that are given to us that we must pay and as those increases come in um we have to make sure that we let council know what those are i mean i i see projected amounts but i'd like to at least let everybody know when it comes to for instance building repairs that's another subject in itself that we've got to start looking at and i know we've been doing a lot of band-aids over the years which really needs to be done it's there's a lot of band-aids been done even before andrea started his town manager and it's it's inevitable that there's expenses in these buildings that we're we we're not going to have any choice either we got to fund the reserves or it's it's it's going to catch us and i know some of that already has i mean at this point with the cost of fuel and heating oil continuously rising we we may not have budgeted correctly because you cannot predict what type of a witcher you're going to have well just the difference darren if i may just the difference today one day if you had to you didn't have any reserve the total gallons of fuel looking at your department police department all the departments of a dollar a gallon today what's that total figure roughly unexpectedly in your budget if you set your budget uh there's areas and i know everybody's going to look at and say we need but there's an inevitable amount that we can't because we're all sorry oh go ahead don't you're right now that's right from where it was this time yeah yeah but i was just leaving a statement to show in one day in 24 hours what fuel can do to your budget again that's without the reserves right we talked about last year's budget and one thing that isn't seen in there is that last year at this time we had 12 000 gallons of diesel in a tank that's right right now we have about four yeah so the differences in that is well and i'm not sure if we're going to have the money to fill our tanks at the end of the year like you normally do is part of your reserve that's right that's right all right andrea is our workers club uh rate as high as is because of our incident rates versus the low response oh well i'm sorry our worker's comfort is it as high as it is because of our incident rate or is it just been going up you know it's because of our incident now we've had people out on workers comp for over a year yes you know what our mod rate is right now i i don't know okay it's a lot of money are there programs that the town can participate in for different safety um we do we do okay so there's no other things that we can do we're doing what we should be doing right because there was one in particular that we did not feel should have been paid and uh but they made the finals yeah we make the final we question everything but the bottom line is what they just like to make and then the next page being classified this top section the outside agencies if we do have these are entities that we actually work very closely with and have citizens that are benefited by all of these agencies and then our other costs at the bottom again you'll notice in there counting tax maine municipal association the meadows northern maine development commission sad 20 state group insurance and 10 interests so we discussed um with the school department at all if there's going to be any relief offered since they've received large amounts of funding this year i have not received any information okay so in order to address that would you would should we go to the meetings for that or is that something that you can reach out on behalf of the town which i i absolutely can have yeah i'm just waiting to hear that and when did you last reach out on that we discussed before the department head budget presentations okay and they weren't ready yet can you follow up and see see the council please yes okay thank you [Applause] any other questions on the other classifiers okay this section on the reserve accounts this is where i would suggest you put in the year to date behind the information on the reserve accounts um what number is that number nine tab number nine and then the information that i gave you the general measure this one here oh okay yep so foreign one of the ones i can point out to you is the paving reserves um if you notice that's only at 225 83 93 which really doesn't get us anywhere where we wanted to be at this point moving forward again the pandemic put a stop to the direction that we were heading with the paving reserves at the 2020 2021 budget and again last year with 2122 budget um but we really that's a not even a quarter of a million dollars and to pave a mile of road 100 pay 100 and we have some roads that are in need of complete repair it's all of our rooms the cost of the road will go up with the cost of fuel oh yeah again the the paving have we stuck with this original plan the paving that we would have done a million dollars worth of paving three years ago uh would have cost us 68 dollars a time it's somewhere over a hundred dollars a time now i'm sure we're going to see prices up to 125. so that's the difference what what you're going to get out of that million dollars so every every day every minute every week every year that we put this off it's costing us more money and the shape of the roads is deteriorating it's just getting worse and that costs you more as well the you know the worse the road just found the the the more the shoulders lay over because of you know water training all right our roads have gotten the point they're actually getting dangerous i agree sir i agree but we can't do anything about it beyond what we're doing without funds you know i i wish there was a magic bullet and we're really hoping for that but those the scope of moses is narrow it will be on flood areas where we can raise the road and that will be full base construction of the deal which will make that a very nice section of road but it's limited where we'll be able to use those funds they'll basically be riverside and muscle um shea siding bridge down prescott street through the light to main street to san margaret road um including sidewalks and retaining walls it has become a safety issue over the last few years and and there's just nothing being done about it and she's constantly thank you dear any other questions from the wizards okay so if you go to the consolidated expenses does council have any questions on any of the departments consolidated expenses their final lines so these um the numbers that you're seeing here under consolidated expenses uh the highlighted number for each of the department and does not it should not include the reserve account because we have a total reserve account on the other the second page so for the library you'll see that her reserve accounts includes the cost of the state roof for the historical part of the building as well as her regular reserve account over and then her number for the library without the reserves did council have any questions on the potato blossom festival this is our 75th anniversary so you do see a difference in the operations um simply because it's our 75th um i i anticipate that it's a one-time cost for a lot of those fans and again of course through the pandemic things were taking out of the festival that we normally would have had in there um and so these consolidated expenses are compilation of the final costs that are being presented to council throughout each individual budget and this just compiles it all together before and just a reminder that that grand total that you're seeing at the bottom you will need to subtract the school and the county caps to get to the number that i gave you earlier um so that you have the municipal cost versus the total number that you're seeing there for the total budget so msad the 2 million 140 000 that's figured into the total expenditures in excess excessive desperate that that's counted that school because the that total grand total that you see and the excess deficit is all included so the grand total that you see 8 million 345 135 that includes the school and the county parents so we can remove those two from there to get that number so to remove the 277 and a 2.1 million dollars and that would be off the off the eight million right so it's not really we're not two million dollars in the hall on this budget well the municipality is because for to pay for whatever they give us for a bill and again they have revenues that they also bring in to cover their costs and then the bill that we get is in addition to so for us the bill that that if we were just doing the municipality and didn't have the school or the county tax so if you take the charity cards out and you take the school you would have the 5 million 925 hundred and forty dollars that i was talking about earlier when we first started and that's what we are asking for as a municipality in order to provide the services that we provide for our citizens and if you take our income which is the six million three hundred twenty five thousand nine hundred and eight dollars and you subtract what we are asking for which is the five million nine hundred twenty five thousand five hundred and forty dollars you'll actually have an overlay of four hundred thousand three hundred and sixty eight dollars yeah but you still have to pay the school and the county cat it's coming out of that i just said that yep i literally just said still coming up i don't care how you slice it we've got to pay for it so take it out all you want to when it's there it's a bill it is a double we have to pay but the the the thing is 50 58 of our 58 of the taxes that i pay go to the school which i don't receive i argue with that point with you before it's not true because there's other revenue in the town like excise tax but you're not even counting the excise is in the it's right on the income i know but it's not on the tax bill the tax bill doesn't show that so the tax bill shows where you're where the money the taxes you pay where it's distributed and that's what your tax bill showed that 58 of my tax bill went to the school last year i understand that and and and less than that went to the town it's deceiving though it's not deceiving here when i'm paying more taxes to the school and you and you're saying that the municipal spend the money hand over fast but i'm paying twice as much for the school that i don't use the municipal budget this year is proposed to be two million dollars short two million not the municipal budget not municipal total budgets but you've got to pay the tax for the county you've got to pay the school so it's part of your budget it's going to be part of your budget so but are we also going to the go to the school school you been to the school have you talked to them about it i'm just asking because everyone is on the town and on the department heads but has anybody gone to the school do you guys sit at the school meetings you guys are responsible for the budget you guys are responsible why don't all five of you go down to the school budgets why doesn't everyone who's concerned go just like they're coming here i have okay good and that's what we should be doing i'm sitting there alone with all school teachers and administrators and i'm the only one asking questions you five have a responsibility for this community i was there as well as councillor butler was there mr troll was there the same meeting that you were at and that's good and we should continue to do that yes so it's good to do that i agree thank you mr chair i just want to touch on something we just discussed things we need to pay by law you are required to fund fire protection by the end of this legislature cycle you will be required by law to provide ambulance service required by law some of our expenses in our department's line item whether we're here as an active department or not you will still have those expenses so i just wanted to comment on those when we're talking about things that we have to pay it's important life safety property it's very frustrating for everyone all of the town employees to deal with this constantly thank you thank you any more questions and expenses that is our consolidated income and we have gotten as close to these numbers as we possibly can with the known numbers that we have keeping in mind we are still waiting to hear from billing on the fire department so we're just going with the same number from last year um the uh excise pretty spot on every year for the last four years last actual year 699 000 excisex and then cable franchise fees that's the number that we are given we don't have really much on that they give us an income before my time here and then if you look further down for local roads assistance that is given to us as well from the state and then the pilots that's the agreements that we have with the corporate health housing authority um the only one that really has not been significantly addressed and has remained a pilot which is a payment in the middle of taxes in case any of the counselors are unaware of that um is aws and since our rebound i feel like it would be significant to ask them for an increase in the payment in their taxes do you recall in any increase at all from the 10 000. not in 25 years before they became this type of economic venue that they are now it was a coordinate discussion on how much services they were requiring from the town and how much value they had in the property that's significantly changed on an annual so if council would allow me to renegotiate that i have a meeting with aws tomorrow i can bring it up i would like that hmm and then if you turn the page over um the rent income has increased from last year to this year due to the availability of our programming uh significantly we're looking at fifty one hundred dollars more on income from the rec department uh municipal revenue sharing that is a number that is given to us by the state do not hold fast to that number as i warned you before that number changes significantly in august and september so um that's where we're at at this point in time but that does not mean that that number is going to hold true this is the part where we have to project what we will be receiving um and their formulas change based on the revenue that they receive versus what they give for revenue sharing for the municipalities and that's there's a whole formula that is based on our town valuation versus what they receive versus how that gets distributed to each of the municipalities um so as of right now that is the number that the state has posted that we will be receiving and if that may change before the next public budget hearing that may change before the next budget vote in june but um and we will produce that number to the best of our abilities with what they give us but i can't guarantee what that number will end up any questions on the income side uh capital improvement planning again this is the information for council this is traditionally uh has been very reactive you use your reserves as your capital improvement planning um and if council is comfortable with that then that's we're going to leave that for this year i have lots of projects i can present to you but i don't think unfortunately i don't think that we have much choice on that so i think we started out in 2019's budget year 2019-2020 with our investments and um really helping move a lot of projects forward with that fiscal year um and thankfully we did because that's what really helped us when the pandemic hit and we were able to not lose any services it worked very well for us um so it is a good example for us to go back to and research when we are in a position where we can do that yeah exactly and then of course these are just the postings for the two of our public budget pages information ready for you and then so i will i know everyone's everyone wants to talk about the middle rate um right that's everybody's most interested and and honestly for me the millwright is one of the last things that i deal with because you don't really do that until september and for me budget starts in november once we receive an audience the next fiscal year begins um so i don't really worrying about the memory i guess i don't want to say worry but i don't really have enabling of what your rank will be um just because we don't get those numbers um and we currently are still working off of last year's values because the finalization of the new rebel has not been completed right um april 1st is the cutoff date and so we are still working through that process of the the new information we have but i will tell you um if you're looking at comparing where your mill rate amount goes um for this particular fiscal year the 19 and a half mill range um 1.44 of that bill goes towards the county tax 11.52 of the 19.5 no rate goes towards the school and 6.54 of your mill rate goes towards the municipal budget so percentage is easier for some and some prefer to hear where the number of the milk is going um but 1.44 mils um worked out to 267 563 so um the statement that it's going to be 31 nils i mean just based off of those numbers it'd be more like 26 mils i yeah what is the town's valuation tony question 1850 185 million thank you so i'm hearing council would like us to um re-look at our budgets um re-value what it is we would like to accomplish this year given the inflation rates uh cost of living is at now at 8.5 um but they're looking at true value numbers at 17 so that's why when you go week groceries the 300 that you spent for groceries for a full card of groceries is not even a part of your car anymore um so that's something that we have to keep in mind as well um so we will and it is not something we are unaccustomed to we are very um i want to say happy but we're ready to do the job and we will do it so um remember that next thursday is the second public budget hearing at 6pm here in the council chambers and any questions comments concerns can be brought to the town manager's office prior to for discussion with council don't forget council you received an email from a citizen um that they wanted you to take a look at in the information that i handed out to you when you received your information tammy did you have something that came in shane been a resident in fort for eight years business owner for 14. i just like clarification um when the department heads do their budget they have to try to figure out what the cost is going to be for fuel for the year coming they have and and health insurance if anything increases they have to put that in their budget to be passed for the next year yes so when we get the information we reach out and find out what these costs are going to be and as we get that information we put that into the budget for the council for them to take a look at and decide what they want to do with that budget that's presented so we present they present to me i kick it back to them and we go back and forth for several months over their budgets and then we have the department head budget presentation in march and then we have the first public budget hearing in april second public budget hearing in may and then june council meeting is the budget vote so we have a that's the final so that's the most difficult thing to do for the department heads in this town is to figure increases that may come up that's right we have to project what those increases will be okay thank you thank you tim robert last question that goes free energy have we considered hiring a large firm golf rundown state that would take us on a contingency basis so we wouldn't have any out of pocket expenses and maybe get some settlement out of this i can find that out we've worked with our town attorney who yeah but that's a different league yep who worked very diligently to try to get our our 2019 taxes back pressing um but unsuccessful we are not the only community that was unsuccessful yeah um but council's wishes um we can discuss yes i i would i would entertain that if we could uh forward some business plan on that to see if in fact uh there's any hope i think it certainly doesn't hurt to trust that that's right yeah that's right also if i if i may the annual report for the town shows uncollected taxes of much less than what re-energy owes where is that re-energy figure command under the lanes yes under liens yeah it's uncollected taxes well where it is at this time it shows gary though it shows the 460 184 but there's going to be some kind of a credit in there that reduces it any other questions good and i want to thank everybody for coming i know it's a lot of information in a short period of time but hopefully what you have for uh literature you can review and we'll meet next time and maybe more of it will make more sense but i thank you thank you thank you,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,RWlK2rG4MqU,"April 13, 2022 Regular Council Meeting",,77.0,4616.0,2022-04-14T01:10:32Z,none,211,0,0,0,for showing up tonight i want to let the record show that all council members are present tony would you uh like to lead us through prayer oh let's see we pray for our country at all times that all systems are safe healthy and happy we pray for wisdom for all those who guide and govern help this government body in every situation to know and to do the things that are right and just with soundness of judgment and making vital decisions we pray for the peacemakers that the holy life given spirit never dwell in their hearts and the barriers of fear suspicion and hatred may fall this we pray to the holy father amen the united states of america and to the republic for success one nation indivisible next uh we're going to uh public comment uh if anybody has anything to stay down to the podium state your name mr chair i'd like to thank the now staff and town manager council for the flowers they sent from my followers my father's blake listen i really really appreciated the thought and gesture robert yes my name is john durpo i've been in this community for 57 years so i've seen some ups and some downs right now we seem to be on a downturn our financial position isn't very well with the economy and the country in the world the way it's going we should be very prudent in the things that we do and the way we spend the money we have a huge debt not that i've experienced everything but the time that i farm when you lose a dollar you've got to make two to get it back and it's awful hard especially in farming to get it back and i would imagine that in the town is going to be just as hard you're going to have to raise taxes some probably but they shouldn't be very much because the people here are going to be under a great amount of pressure with everything they buy two big items is food and gasoline right now because you buy it every day and you spend it a lot so this is a good time to i'd have probably waited a while before i started saying all of this but you're going to be doing your budget for the next year and it's going to be a budget for a lot of years ahead it's going to take a long time to come out of this hole people can't stand a lot more taxes here the farming community can't stand any more taxes because they're under great pressure this committee you reform for public advisory committee i think is a decent idea you might get some different ideas there's some people on there that's probably well-versed in finances but when it comes to farming you're going into a great peril right now the process and plants the seed industry doesn't make any difference which way you turn you're not going to have enough money so the processor we've gotten hit with big electric bills electric bills alone would set you back the grocery bills with gasoline and everything else i'd just like to remind you that this is going to have to be dealt with very carefully and there can't be anything i mean anything in the town you can't look at the budget and say do we need this or do we need that but i am concerned about a lot of things here i'm not farming now but i do understand where it's going and what it's going to cost so that's about all i got to say for right now but thank you thank you mr dorco uh anybody else all right if not we'll move on to correspondence and reports there are no license uh financial report checking account balance is a 331 2022 is 517 591.25 which highest savings is 5 000. excise collected in february was 59 360 and 24 cents compared to last year at 59 835.68 as of 228 2022 uncollected real estate taxes for 2021 for 531 135 versus increased expenses is 103 242 we received march revenue sharing in the amount of 38 864.92 on 322 2022 total revenue sharing received to date is six hundred and three thousand two hundred seventy two dollars and sixty seven cents we are at sixty nine point nine percent versus budget of seventy five percent which is down five point one percent equaling forty three thousand nine hundred eighty dollars okay next we got the uh aws report steve can you counselors uh andrew is back uh on april 1st on friday first um i'm pleased to to tell you that we had our uh audited financial statements for 2021 and everything looks very fine we had no deficiencies and everything else was cleaned in the audit so that all went through a fine we approved our finances for january and february both at that meeting uh we're trending a little bit behind schedule a lot that has to do with the weather and sometimes it has to do with the weights that are on the roads right now but uh our recyclables are keeping us up so that we're in a positive balance at any rate active for us in our legislation the state of maine's legislature was looking at raising what we paid in the state of maine per ton from one dollar a ton to five to ten dollars a ton and they compromised on two dollars which is a very fair compromise um we're very lucky to have mark who can be as active in the state level as he is and still runs the day-to-day activities of the identity out there uh we're very fortunate about that we are still looking forward to anyone in listening tonight he is of anyone that wants to do any litter picking picking up plastic bags at the landfill in both pascali and or fairfield is an annual thing that we try to do as soon as the snow goes away and mud dries up a little bit and they pay volunteer groups ten dollars an hour per person so it's a good uh it's a good opportunity for churches or boy scout groups or girl scout groups that may want to do something anyone that's interested in that please contact any other people uh we had some discussions on uh starting up of cell five and cell six which is our next big investment at the landfill here carolina that takes about a year to get to the paperwork process of that and mark made a suggestion that we may want to bring on board our contractor early to help us do that because we wait till the year is done we maybe have a hard time finding contractors there's really only three contractors in the area that are even certified to do landfill sales so we proved for mark to go forward and start looking for contractors for that and also start to pick work with the engineers on the project itself that should get us 10 years really into landfill pillars to sell so it's a good project for us to be starting now we're a little hard scheduled on starting that but uh we've had some more discussions just so you know what may happen when the prescott landfill closes for right now and when mark actually did the logistics on the people that are traveling in and out of the preschool landfill we think we can handle it pretty easily by just bringing a pack or truck there and letting the people bring stuff into a pack of trucks and in the pack truck will make a couple of deliveries a week before people will drop it off any bulky materials will be set aside in rolled over so it seems to be a lot less cumbersome than we thought it was going to be and we asked we're already situated pretty much for when the time comes just down the line we've got the packing trucks in the bunk is already at the landfill for us to be able to do that here we're going to start something like prescott so anybody any questions thank you very much thank you steve next we'll go to old business uh tax acquired property the following property was put out for

they we have a counselor who's been through this so i actually put this out to bid um i think it was two years ago that we did it yeah yes okay um and i did actually was the one that put it out to bid in for the municipality it seemed like everywhere was way out of range compared to what they were currently paying i don't know who it's with now okay yeah and they were the best rate at that point in time so okay usually with these they put out to bid every year i would assume every three years was tradition but i've done it since yeah with price changes yeah okay all right all right uh next we got seawall central rooster cable the central holistic cable consortium was a group of area communities fort pierce fort kent mapleton and woodland formed to negotiate cable franchise consulting and renewal agreement services with james w zuma company to twc charter communications it was brought to our attention from james w sewell company that an outstanding invoice from 2018 needed to be paid

evening i'd like to take a moment to thank the town manager of the town council and the residents of fort fairfield for their continued support of the police department i've been a resident of this community for the last 13 years and your police chief for the last nine months when i walked in the door last july we had no full-time staff and just one part-time policeman we've been able to hire two full-time officers in a short time and we now have a tentative offer out in our third and final open position which we hope to have filled within this month we've employed several dedicated reliable professional part-time officers to help supplement our coverage we are extremely grateful for their dedication i have a couple items to address tonight first i'd like to take a moment to thank several community members who came together to get some much needed demolition and renovations done in our police department we had a major donor who wanted to remain anonymous i know who you are i want to publicly thank you i also want to thank the following community members and staff for your assistance first my wife erica cummings miss andrea powers chuck and allison ainsworth barrett fisher deputy sheriff nathan chisholm from the sheriff's office mike greenlaw greenlaw electric adam st peter st peter and sons plumbing jake and steve rajeski darren hanson in the highway department for hauling away the demolition debris with all out all of this community support this project would have never come to fruition we're truly grateful next item uh is a promotion of officer jesse cormier to the rank of sergeant sergeant cormier worked for the fort fairfield police department 2018 2019 ended up leaving us in 2020 i'm happy to report that sergeant cormier has been back since the fall and is a pivotal member of this department he has spent countless hours training new staff members and getting them acclimated to the town of fort fairfield sergeant cormier and i have been splitting the weekly coverage and working extremely long patrol and on-call hours sergeant cormier is a leader to the members of our staff and as a parent and how the younger members of the department look up to him and address him sergeant cormier has worked at other local police departments as a patrol supervisor and has over 20 years of police experience i am proud tonight to present sergeant cormier with a certificate of promotion and look forward to working with sergeant cormier to continue to rebuild the fort fairfield police department i'd like to take a moment to present sergeant cormier with a certificate and a moment for family to take a couple of photos thank you i think we get a couple photos of this family too thank you guys for coming thank you everybody thank you next we've got uh server replacement rebooted reboot it has informed me that the server we have currently is well beyond its expected lifespan and is in need of replacing immediately the hpe proliant gen 10 high performance server tower is their recommendation for a replacement that's going to be a reliable server for the foreseeable future reboot information technologies builds manages maintains monitors and stores all of our software and hardware needs its support is 24 7 cloud hosting and data backup and integration of enterprise communication services that are all managed from their data center without this server replacement we run the risk of data loss and unknown amount of downtime the recommendation is that council allows the town manager to move forward with the replacement of the town server with reboot i.t for and 8635.13 cents from g one three zero one zero zero zero so move second we had a motion and a second any discussion are there any uh other bids so we have a contract with reboot for pipelines and yeah i'm sure if you have questions for them so in that contract we can't go up for bids for larger items like they can do that with us okay so this is their to find us the i don't want to say least expensive but the piece of equipment that serves us the best for a very reasonable price it's got a three-year warranty how long have they been serving serving the town since 2019 so we had no real data so you go out and research obviously and this was the best option for what we need yeah we tend to stay away from the cheap solutions it's not by any means the most expensive it's the middle of the road we find the best we have the most longevity out of it without you know sacrificing for something cheaper we structure the contracts that we do with everybody so that we don't we're not looking to make the money on the hardware so we can work with the businesses to get the best products that they can use while everybody's being taken care of because our service is covered so there's no install costs we're a part of the consider ourselves a part of the town so it's just the cost of the equipment and then this like somebody mentioned their three-year warranty it's a product that if there's physical damage or hardware or something goes wrong with it they we have contracts downstate where people come up and take care of the equipment itself for those three years so if there's a surge in power or anything like that and it does damage to that is that is that covered under any kind of warranties under insurance that would be more of an insurance role we have and we have battery backup in place and we have redundant power supplies so typically if the battery backup fails and that takes a surge there's multiple power supplies so if one fails they're hotspottable it's backup yeah we have one backed up good thank you thank you we'll uh go for a vote melissa mitt hi jim and i vote next we'll go to primary june election appointments the primary election is scheduled for june 14th 2022 election clerks will be compensated at 12.75 per hour per minimum wage as in the past we need to have the council vote on a opening 8 a.m and closing 8 pm of the polls which is set by the state as stated in title 21-8 subsection 626 the voting location community center for title 21-8 subsection 622-a c the election warden midra e dubois d approval of election clerks of the warden's choosing recommendation that town council approves a through e as presented so moved second got a motion in a second melissa hi mitch kevin jim hi and i bowed eye next we got the wreck department donation background title 30-amrsa subsection 5654 states that a conditional gift for any specified public purpose offered to a municipality may be accepted or rejected by its legislative body discussion the recreation department has been contacted by multiple individuals looking to make donations that will directly support our programming we have come up with a sponsorship booklet that outlines our department's program needs which support growth in current and future programs two of the individuals have responded with requests to sponsor specific equipment the first individual wishes to make a cash donation of two thousand dollars they requested these funds to be used towards the purchase of two jugs light flight pitching machines three dozen light flight baseballs and three dozen light flight softballs we often have more than one team practicing at a time so two machines will be beneficial each light flight machine works with both light site baseballs and softballs any extra funds they ask to be used towards youth sports the lifeline machines can be run by an extension cord connected to an outlet a gas generator near the machine at the mound or a jet battery pack designed specifically for the light flight pitching machine the second individual wants to anonymously donate two life flight battery packs each pack will run a pitching machine for roughly three hours having the battery pack means there's no tripping hazard for a cord running across the base pack and we don't need a noisy generator on the field the value of the battery packs is 360 each for a total value of 720 the value of these combined sponsorships totals 2 720 the recommendation is that town council accepts the two anonymous sponsorship donations to our department with a total value of 2 720 make a motion to approve the donation one second a second put a motion in a second melissa hi matt hi kevin hi jim hi and i beautify next we got the rec department fund project the parks and recreation department has begun the process of preparing to apply for grant funding through the land and water conservation fund the grant funding is going to be used towards upgrading puddle dock and riverside pumps to meet the recreational needs of our community and to improve the safety of these two assets as part of the grant process the lwcf requires project certification this document certifies that our governing body the town council certifies that they are aware of and approve the following that council authorizes fort pepino parks and recreation department to make application for financial assistance under the provisions of the land and water conservation fund act public law 88-578 for development of puddle dock and riverside parks that council is familiar with the terms and conditions of the land and water conservation fund project agreement revised dated march 1995 and hereby authorizes our town manager to enter into said agreement between fort fairfield and the state of maine upon federal approval of the above identified project that the fort fairfield recreation department has been legally constituted and is responsible for planning and carrying out the municipal recreation program and the continued operation and maintenance of this completed project in accordance with the terms and conditions of the land and water conservation fund project agreement and that except for the financial assistance requested by this project application no financial assistance has been applied for it given or promised under any other state or federal program the recommendation is that council certifies our parks renovation project so we may proceed with the application process to meet our june 30th 2022 deadline melissa hi mitch hi kevin hi jim hi and i blowed eye next we got the library aba compliant door on march 1 2022 the library's ada compliant entrance door opener suffered a terminal failure of the drive motor the opener was installed in 1994 and operates the main rear entrance to the library and provides the only access to our vertical wheelchair wheelchair lift the unit is no longer manufactured and is unable to be repaired and the motor is unable to be replaced the entire drive head unit over the door must be replaced failure to repair the ad automatic opener exposes the town to possible fines of a minimum of seventy five thousand up to a hundred and fifty thousand dollars portland glass was consulted and they have provided a written quote of three thousand three hundred and twenty eight dollars for replacement of the unit the recommendation is that the librarian directors recommendation is to accept the quote of 3 328 and approve the director to engage the services of portland glass to replace the ada compliant entrance door opener got a motion and a second any discussion uh what is this coming on a reserve account or a library now so the library has no reserve account so it's going to have to come from one of our other line items admin has a reserve account and there's enough funds in there so that would be my recommendation to take it from that that's what we put it there for correct correct it doesn't meet the uh requirements under undesignated okay um the undesignated principle so admin reserves were qualified so we have to make it uh as a motion to take it out of the administrative reserve so a second let's write a motion in a second thank you next we got the fort fairfield atp club mr stratton i can read it for you would you please my name is ken stratton and i am a resident of fort fairfield and have been for 28 years i am also the current president of the full frontier atv club here in fort fairfield and have been since 2017. back in 2017 after being elected president of the club i had several in-town residents contact me asking me if it was legal for them to operate their atv from their residence to the local atv trails they had told me that they had been stopped by our local police department and told that they were not allowed to use the side streets in town to get to the trains since getting back into atving in 2011 i have checked with our local police chief about road use and have always been told that we wouldn't be bothered if we behaved and followed the rules of the road i guess some folks are told they can't and others are told they can't having heard from a few past club officers and our local state representative that had been on the child council back then that the town of fort fairfield did approve atvs using the town streets to get the trails many years ago but none of them could remember exactly why i inquired about this with our town manager back in 2018 and was told that he would look into and get back with me a few weeks later he contacted me and told me that there was no record whatsoever that this had been approved by title for fairfield and that if the residents of fort fairfield wanted to use the streets to get to the trail we would have to go before the town council and ask again i did and it was shot down a month or so later i approached town council again this time asking for a few in-town atv access routes instead of all streets that would provide a legal way for almost all of the in-town residents to get to and from the trails three of the four proposed access routes were denied this past winter i found some free time to dig through hotel council minutes and came across the minutes of april 12 2012 where the town council did in fact approve local residents using the side streets to access the local atv trails had i been given the information that i requested back in 2018 i never would have had to go before the town council to ask for the town to approve it again and this time have it shot down i'm here to ask the current town council uh why was i told there was no such record for in-town road use for atvs being approved when in fact it was and why was our local atv ordinance not updated to reflect this decision what can we do here tonight to straighten this out and make it legal for our local residents to use the streets to get to closest trail head if in town road use for the sole purpose of getting to and from the trails is going to be allowed for our local residents i strongly suggest that we include what's allowed and what's not allowed in our local etv thank you andrew welcome um there's also a letter included in here from chief cummings yeah i didn't bring that letter i just brought a few talking points i i did meet with um ken stratton on i believe it was friday regards to atvs uh we we did have a good discussion um i do have a couple issues with atvs on the side streets um which wouldn't be prudent to me if i didn't bring those up i believe that it poses a safety risk due to the volume of traffic on our side streets how narrow the shores are specifically roosevelt fisher blaine brunswick milk colombia as well as the curves that create visibility issues on columbia and fisher i'm sure you all know what i'm talking about i believe if we open up the side streets to all atvs we're going to have a safety problem with atvs motor vehicles and pedestrians i had a discussion with mr stratton president of the atv club the law does allow governoring bodies of municipality to open up town-owned streets and atvs and set rules in place regarding this the current atv trails that we have along with access roads that have been designated in the past by the town council allow atvs access to all of our local food and fuel establishments on main street and preschool street anything that's decided in regards to allowing atvs would not include route 1a route 161 presque isle street or main street because they are state roads we don't have any authority over that in discussions with mr stratton should the town council decide to honor his request to open up the side streets to atv's working with the atv club i recommend the following language for this type of access limiting the atv access to citizens and residents of fort fairfield who are using the roadway in accessing the atv trail from their residence to home residents are home to the trail only limiting it from you live on center street you're going from center street to the trail and that's that's it you're not going from center street to your buddy's house on brown street to visit i mean this is just to get to the trail and this is to help citizens who who cannot trailer or things like that to the to the park and ride uh requiring atvs to travel to the extreme right of the roadway and travel no faster than 15 miles per hour uh four fairfield police officers will monitor the atv traffic as we do with motor vehicle traffic uh to ensure that atvs are adhering to the laws is set forth by the state and as directed by the council and i believe if it starts to get out of hand and it starts to be a big safety issue especially on streets like brunswick where the elementary school is there's a lot of kids walking that street it's really narrow vehicles have to move completely into the other lane to give children a place to walk and that's an issue in itself without adding atvs to the mix if it becomes a big issue and it's really problematic we would need the council to to tighten the reins and maybe take that privilege away any questions i believe um mr stratton came to see me on sunday he brought a proposed um i guess addendum to to an ordinance um we would need some time to in working with miss powers to to come up with some appropriate language for for this and if if the ordinance is going to be amended then we need to go through the proper channels of a public hearing and so on and so forth because i know there are not everybody in town is in favor of atvs on the roadways so they would need a chance to come in and speak in regards to that as well so if i could get possibly a motion to provide the next level of writing an ordinance uh for the town manager uh we could take that step but that's what i would need is a motion to advise the town manager to pursue in an ordinance i motioned that okay we had a motion in a second obviously we had discussion any other discussion we have access to all of the trail heads and the businesses so this would just give additional access for people that are unable to trailer what did we say the maximum fee was probably ken uh we were kind of discussing that right now state law says you're allowed 500 yards on the road from point a to point b and piece property off permission beyond same with point b if we wanted if we had a compact zone here in town i'm told that we don't um if we were to set a limit of say 1 000 yards i think everybody pretty much in the compact zone would illegally be able to get to the trail i know the discussion came up as if this ever gets out of hand the only people that would ever be operating on brunswick avenue are the two families that have homemade gvs there nobody else has business being our friends the same ground street center street and all the other streets get from your house to the closest trailhead don't go to your friend's house no tooling up and down the road no going around the block no going to the grocery store 15 miles an hour my only concern is that we you know with the police department having issues with something that we've had not having you know just being able to have to take care of that when we're trying to take care of a lot of other things that's my only concern i understand people trying to get to the trails and i mean we should do so i totally do understand that and not everyone can trailer so i see that as well so we understand things kind of got out of hand last year because we didn't have a full-time police department here hopefully that won't happen again well this is the problem that we we discussed before i mean it will get out of hand um we're just introducing an ordinance and all we're doing right okay so we're going to introduce an ordinance so discussion will be taken care of well it's really just a change to the existing order i think it's the same process you have to go through the procedures i can tell you that the way our call volume has been over the last year [Music] atv law enforcement is not going to be one of our priorities because we're dealing with drug issues domestic violence issues um assaults and things of that nature and traffic has kind of taken a back seat to all of those high priority calls so we're not always going to have somebody on the side streets to monitor this these issues so that can also be problematic it's like with anything else there's always going to be problems well we'll go for a bubble melissa all right hi jim hi kevin yeah and i vote next we've got the wlr property zoning change request the property manager for wlr property rentals would like the council to consider a zoning change for use of their property located at 232 main street the village square building they would like to convert the second floor from commercial to apartment residential space that includes 10 spaces with a focus on senior housing with an option to also convert a section of the first floor to apartment residential space as needed the planning board meets may 10 2022 the recommendation is that council directs the town manager to forward the request of wlr property to the planning board for review and recommendation with a motion and a second any discussion if not we'll go for a vote melissa mitch kevin jim and i will die next we got the northern maine railroad group several communities and an independent state authority in central university county have joined into a coalition focused on a reduced potential for portions of the maine northern railroad corridor the railroad corridor currently leased from maine department of transportation by maine northern railway and irving land subsidiary connects preston caribou fort fairfield and limestone together via rail regular rail service however has often offered past maysville street and presque isle for over two years service to caribou has not been offered for a decade and not since the mid-1990s to fort fairfield and limestone this rail corridor that historically connected our communities has been largely abandoned in place bridges have not been maintained and repairs have not been completed resulting in areas that are washed out overgrown or otherwise lost to time and elements especially from caribou north to limestone and the former marine air force base potential reuse of this corridor is envisioned with the development of a regional multi-use recreational corridor once again linking our communities together or possibly a co-inhabited rail multi-use trail system connecting the communities in central aristic county and beyond this group will be requesting that the maine department of transportation form a rail corridor use advisory council as defined by ld 1133 and add to amend the transportation laws that would upon petition review and make recommendations on the likelihood benefits and costs of potential uses for portions of the maine northern railroad corridor in central austin county recommendation is that council agrees to sign a letter of support to commissioner van note maine department of transportation for a rail corridor use advisory council it's removed secondly we've got a motion in a second uh any discussion this trailhead looks to me he's going from prescott to cairo to limestone and um so they need the for the go through the parts before fairfield is not going lincoln to four fairfield whatsoever uh yeah it does on the map you know on the strickland road west grove right there that's where it crosses down by hearty catches that's big i just want to say everybody this is this is this is a big event to connect this and have this work done it is it would bring a lot of economic uh resources to all our communities it really would so all right uh we'll have a vote hi mitch hi kevin hi jim and i will die next we got spring cleanup due to lack of staff we will be unable to do curbside pickup during spring cleanup this year we will however accept wood yard debris and metal that is brought to our sand shed monday through thursday between the hours of 6 a.m to 4 30 p.m on the week of may 16 through may 19th doing spring cleanup in this manner will allow us to still provide a good service to the taxpayer in a safe and timely fashion any questions uh yeah i think they should probably know a little bit more what this is gonna detail so don't put anything else beside the road bring it to the sand shed we'll load it onto a truck for you separate it take it where it needs to go anything less left outside of the hour specified will be considered littering so the the the cleanup process for everybody in fort fairfield would would rely on them loading it themselves and bringing it into the sanchez yes sir that's correct i think that's the only misconfusement we may have i just hope that everybody understands or can clerically get that out there to everybody because they've been so used to everybody just yet we've just been waiting for approval from the counselor to have discussion on it so that we can get some advertisement they're here to let everybody know what we're going to do and that will start that process yeah you're going to be sectioned off areas around this shed where you put things or no we'll have a crew right there all day yeah we'll have a loader sitting there so there's no heavy lifting like i said we've got limited staff i i envision three people there all the time one traveling back and forth to the dump with the yard debris we'll have two trucks sitting there loader loading into it uh another two trucks for metal and a guy shuttling each one of those trucks back and forth yeah the only thing i'd like to even though you do advertise i i would like obviously if if somebody didn't communicate in any way to find out the difference uh we would be able to contact them first to let them know that they this is what's going on rather than not and there is trash side the road and we have the pd drive out and give them a ticket for litter and if you know i just i just would like to see in this closet they you would make at least one of the attempt to contact the homeowner to say hey this james yeah that's a good suggestion i don't think that's what director hanson was referring to i think he meant people just dumping stuff at all hours right through that week right okay yeah okay so other towns have have done what we're doing and they've basically tried to leave the equipment sitting there and uh taxpayers came and just loaded this it doesn't work you end up with batteries and tires and yeah it just turns into a real mess yeah so so there if there was uh some things out there that had would say a lot of metal a lot of stuff that they couldn't get there would say and then they had a mess that needed to be cleaned up uh is there anything that could be done about that we can't do it for one and not another if if we're gonna do it for one we're gonna do it for everybody unfortunately we can't pick and choose i i'd really like to do it the way we've been doing it we just don't have the staff we we wouldn't be able to do it safely i i project it would take a month and and in that month we wouldn't be patching the road we're going to be cleaning ditches we wouldn't be taking care of water problems uh you know we would we would put a lot of stress back on the taxpayer that way so it's an unfortunate situation but it is what it is thank you yes thank you mr chair i make a recommendation authorized to tell manager i don't uh next we got the cdbg application so we had two um entities submitting letters of intent the one for nscd20 after bob clark from nmdc spoke with the superintendent dope and they've decided to hold back upon that letter of intent for now because of possible funding from the department of education um so once we get more information on red down at what the amount of money that they may receive from the department of education then we can formally introduce at a later time for nbrc cdbg any of dcd any of those other entities um but it was under the suggestion of mr clark that we wait on that one so we just have the one letter of intent to vote on tonight um the letters of intent to the maine department of economic and community development dcd and the office of community development for community development block ground funds on behalf of tebow farms llc for grant funds to purchase equipment using the economic development program the recommendation is that council votes to authorize the town manager to sign the letter of intent for the community development block grant funds on behalf of tebow farms llc so moved second and a motion in a second any discussion if not we'll call for a vote melissa hi mitch kevin hi jim and i will die next we got the minutes of march 16 2022 in our regular council meeting sure make a motion we approve that's in march 16th second got a motion in a second vote for a vote melissa hi mitch hi kevin yeah and i will die next we got the warrants number 19 and 20. or uh number 19 in the amount of one 167 117 and 68 cents and more number 20 in the amount of 130 000 670 130 five dollars and twenty five cents um was completed on march thirty first twenty twenty two checking balance after completion award number twenty was five hundred and five thousand seven hundred and fifty seven dollars and fourteen cents melissa hi mitch hi kevin hi jim and i will die uh next we have other and thought if you'd like to come up and present [Music] first off thank you town council for hearing me tonight um my name is scott colton and i am vice president of cape bell industrial services and uh there's been some changes happening over there and some bigger changes to come so i'm here tonight to ask you folks for some help and i don't know i'm not sure exactly what you have or what you don't have so is is does everyone have a copy of the letter i presented to the town along with the maps and whatnot if you don't or if anybody wants one i've got spares here we have one okay set these here for a minute and just uh so you folks will kind of have some stuff to look at it'll help illustrate next thank one thank you let's just kind of help speak to you know what i'm going to be telling you folks thank you thank you i know it's a lot of stuff bear with me so we we at k-power for those that don't know we've we've been sold we have a new owner his name is tyler player he owns pdi out of westbrook and presque isle he is a local person he's from the presque isle area and so some of you may know him he's been in the area a long time they own an engineering group and basically what they do at this time is go around the world they design dryer systems for pellet mills for lumber yards for wood products of any kind need to be dried so part of this marriage of the two companies if you will what we're going to be doing in the future is at the chaney grove at the end of channing grove the building there that we own we've turned that into a manufacturing facility a lot of what you see in the brochures and pliers are drying equipment it's a lot of duct work it's cyclones it's a lot of equipment it's fuel bins it's structural steel so pdi travels the world selling systems they design them and now we're going to build them and we're going to ship them all over the world from fort fairfield so you know it's in one sense it's a great thing for us but i think it's also a good thing for the town of fort fairfield uh there's several things that come about on this number one what we're asking for is for you folks to consider to let us acquire some additional land that will be adjacent to the land that we own now and the reason for that is we're just starting and we know we're too small which is a good problem and yes but um the facility we have now will allow us to manufacture but it's still a little bit small so some of the additional need for space is to put up another large building we need to house the raw material the steel that come in we have we have we're buying thousands of pounds of steel at a time it's structural steel it's plate steel it's everything that we need to to manufacture what we're doing so on the other end of the manufacturing process we have to paint the items before it goes to the customer so not only do we need that building to house the raw material before it goes in and to be worked on but we we need to paint the finished product it's not like painting the car or anything that technical but you know folks that customers that like to see this come to their place with a color on it and some protection from you know the rain and the elements um again in those pamphlets it shows you a lot of what tyler players pdi does and what they're selling and what we'll be building at this point in time in in the last month we've put on three employees that over what we had before our hope is by the end of jail or the end of june 1st of july somewhere in that neighborhood we will have gone from 13 to 26 employees so we're looking to put on a substantial workforce in the area we're looking to grow we're looking to add buildings which i think it's a win for everybody it adds revenue for your town and for you folks uh it brings other employees to the town and some of the spin-off for that is they're going to spend money in the stores and go eat lunch and you know these sort of things um so on my on the letter that i presented in the second page you'll see a map of where our current building is and then not and forgive me i did this but i didn't know i wasn't positive what land you folks own versus what might belong to somebody else so the dotted line between parcel one and parcel two is the existing fence that used to be the entry into the into the power plant you know our goal if it's possible we'd like to acquire both those parcels uh it's kind of a square there but it it's surprisingly uh a sizable piece there and and it's it's flat ground so you know that's a perfect place to set up a new building um the parcel three does a couple of things it kind of squares up our property on that side of the building and but it also allows us a couple of things if if we chose we wanted to add on to the west side of the building where that parking lot is now we we could add on in that direction or if we found that bringing trucks down in to go through our existing building we could come down we could extend the driveway down down around and take a straight shot into the building with tractor trailers as opposed to having to make a tight turn that's there now so we're just we're trying to set ourselves up we know we're going to grow we know we're going to bring additional resources to the community we know we're going to bring revenue to the community we're asking you to help us do that and i'm open to any questions anybody's got close up property we energies okay sorry thanks um the only billing discussion that i've had with um the public works director specifically because we've had other businesses recently approached us about and there's lots of space up there so um we really want to keep this turnaround as a tractor-trailer turn around it's not forgive me i don't i don't want you to think i'm interrupting you but we have no intent to uh to close any of that off because we know we need those roads as well what we're looking to do is put a building in the minimum in the middle of it and then we have options as to which way we can access the building uh that little parking lot that's up there now uh is is a great place for us sometimes it's easier for us to take things up there and load it onto tractor trailers tractor trailer drivers they get a little fussy sometimes on you know how level their their trailer is and where they like to be loaded and they prefer easy so um you know it's just to us it just seems like an ideal fit for us and what our thoughts and plans are for our growth in the future um maintaining that as a tractor trailer turn around actually benefits the other businesses that are already established like the recycling center um currently right now the truck for trailers are they have to do a lot of turning around but if it's a smooth in the wintertime smooth turn around for them it's much easier yeah existing the existing road that goes uh uh goes straight behind that parcel and goes out to where the chip pops used to be at the power plant i mean that that road is beyond what what we're asking for uh as far as that goes uh but that whole turnaround i mean it benefits us just as well as does anyone else that turn around anybody that's up there operating yeah really i mean sooner or later we i'm kind of making the assumption that where the old power plant used to stand it's a matter of time somebody's going to be out there so you know i mean in the spirit of cooperation it just benefits all of us to play nice in the sandbox i have a question for you it says building addition yes what what's the is this part of the manufacturing side of it we're already talking about adding on to that our existing building because it's not big enough um and you know when the time comes for that you know we're looking to probably go in that direction uh and maybe taller than the existing building is now to give us some some moving room but um with pdi and and k bell together it just it fits it works really well and i think it's going to be something that's going to grow well in the future because as i said player design right now they have probably 13 projects going on in canada the united states vietnam they're they're all over the world and so you know he's he's another case of a local boy down well and with that in mind i i think that the the growth of us together just you know brings everything a step closer uh one of the future steps is to not only design it build it send it out but design it build it and go install it because the larger customers tend to want a turnkey package they want something that they can just go to tyler and say you either done well or we've got some problems and we need you to fix it or whatever the place may be but the situation is if if we design it build it and install it you know chances are if there's any issues along the way it'll be taken care of and a better product for the customer how big of a building unknown yet um where the weird parcel is somewhere in that neighborhood because anything new i like cause you know i just um there's really still some planning to go into you know what that might look like uh we definitely along building a longer building we see that as a benefit because all the different raw materials that we need the different thicknesses and sizes of sheet steel beams angle iron all that stuff would have to come into that building and be placed on rack and a storage system until it was time to bring it down into the to the shop for fabrication but uh you know even aside from the wood industry that pdi services now pdi also plans on on getting together with us and we're going to go to the local communities we're going to go to the twin rivers paper and we're going to go to mccain's easton and huber and say folks we have a full capability here in your home in your home area there's no need to go to wisconsin there's no need to go so you know hopefully in the future we open that door and and allow uh you know growth in the local area as well so we really want to service arista county fort fairfield and in the world fantastic we're very excited to have pdi and expansion of k-pal and growth in our community it's very exciting so we're glad to have you invite my interject here for just a minute um i've known tyler for a lot of years and scott and i've been in business together for 20 years and these guys are on their game they really are and uh i think that what they're telling us is what's going on i've heard lots of great things about um pdi so very excited to have him here uh and the amount of time that i've been dealing with him on i'll say my personal level and business level i mean i'm impressed as well so i he's he's already you know taking us in directions we're we're building 30 million btu burners biomass burners for facilities we're building air heat exchangers uh you know it's it's it's uh it's fun it's fun and it's amazing and it's a good time so are you going to give a proposal for what you want like how much well other than explaining to you folks what we would like to get i wasn't even sure what was available uh so i guess what we would like to have is as you folks come back to uh you know talk it over do what it is you folks do and then come back with an offer to us no i do not i feel naked but that's okay and we really should think about you know what your needs are and what you're looking for because you may want to go in a different direction i know that's leveled around but there's level ground there's a lot of level ground up there and the issue that i can see that you may run into in the future is having a right away going through three different broken up pieces of property that you're trying to move equipment back and forth large pieces of equipment through so just just think about that because you know you're you're in the front of what should be a large built up industrial area with all of that traffic trying to go through it there are other options there all the things that we can do i'm so we set a motion uh words so we had a motion in a second uh we'll go for a vote melissa hi mitch hi jim hi and i vote i i think it sounds great thank you we think so okay uh we have a oh i'm sorry um so at this point um is this the proper phone number to contact you answer 472-1600 yes great well we're looking we're looking forward to this i want to thank you for everything tonight well thank you folks and i apologize uh it took so long for us to get to hear you but it's it's uh it was worth the wait that's for sure okay thank you thank you thank you next we've got a uh a i m r s a um to go into executive session second session second all those in favor say hi i want to thank everybody for showing up tonight and have a great evening and a safe ride home,True
UCphQA4DKYX14O32KDdf_mSQ,Town of Fort Fairfield,OTYB9ybKDSA,"March 16, 2022 Regular Town Council Meeting",,339.0,20352.0,2022-03-17T12:39:53Z,none,166,2,0,0,we pray for wisdom for all those who died and govern help this government body in every situation to know and to do things that are right and just the soundness of judgment making vital decisions we pray for the peacemakers that the holy life different spirit may have oil in our hearts and the barriers of fear suspicion and hatred may fall this we pray to the holy father amen next we'll go into public comment thank you very much for the opportunity a couple things i want to say first of all i want to say that u.s conference have a really tough job ahead of you i hope you all come together to get that job done last year we went through a tough time with the budget approved and we had a lot of comments on it and so forth and it come up with deficit spending i don't know where we're going to stand this year but i would estimate based on what i've seen in the past numbers the fact that we're not going to get any federal money the state revenue share is going to be down and our deficit this year will exceed a million dollars that's my rough guess exceed a million dollar deficit up to you folks to do something about that but i strongly recommend that the advisory committee that's on the agenda be approved it is an advisory committee to have any power it don't dictate to anybody but if you can have somebody else beside the five of you looking at the numbers it might be helpful if it isn't disregarded just disregard it but i honestly feel that coming forward we need to all pull together because a million dollars is going to increase the tax six or seven mills we're at 19.5 last year i hate to see it go beyond 25 but based on those numbers it may happen so you five hopefully you'll come together and work together to get this job done and keep that mill rate down thank you very much thank you gary uh next we got uh correspondence and reports sorry about that anybody out very good we'll move on correspondence and reports there are no licenses and permits to report next we'll go to licenses and permits there are men to report uh financial report checking account balance as of 228 2022 was 887 thousand one hundred and eight dollars and thirty five cents much higher savings was five thousand excise collected in february was thirty two thousand nine hundred fifty two dollars and twenty seven cents compared to thirty eight thousand five hundred and twelve dollars and eighteen cents last year as of 228 2022 the uncollected real estate taxes for 2021 were 689 743 dollars and 14 cents compared to last year at and sixty five thousand seven hundred and eight dollars and fifty two cents as of february 28 2022 our revenue was up fourteen point six five percent which equals nine hundred and eighty three thousand three hundred and thirteen dollars and seventy cents our expenses were up 2.01 which equals 141 542.60 the difference between revenue increase and expense increase is 12.64 which is hundred and forty one thousand seven hundred seventy one dollars and fifteen cents [Applause] we received february revenue sharing in the amount of eighty thousand seven hundred twenty dollars and ninety nine cents on february twenty 23 2022 total revenue sharing received to date is 564 407.75 we are at 65.4 versus the budget of 66.67 percent which is down ten thousand nine hundred fifty six dollars next we've got the aws report any evening our last meeting was on february 25th uh budgeting clients struggling where you were beginning the year so this is pretty slow but we are certainly ahead of schedule on our budgets and mostly that's because of recycling income recycling comes in an all-time high right now uh we're taking advantage of that as much as we can to get our stuff processed and sold we are we're reviewing our development developmental timeline i spoke a little bit about this to you last month when i was here we're looking at some of the changes in preschool landfill and how we're going to make corrections that are natural you know that's what we have smaller probably a year ahead of schedule on closing the question on landfill but but uh mark is putting together some uh plans with the engineers to help us make sure we have without much of an issue uh to go along with that we started discussions with presque isle on how we'll actually maybe do a transfer station or do something to bring the fiscal trash to buildings officials about bringing in 100 extra thousands so because some growth that could be a crippling issue for both us and utilities districts so we're watching that very closing the state seems to be looking at some great height tolerances uh the deployment for really for to our benefit is really going to take some time to study this rather than jump on the state's numbers uh we're lucky that we had mark marks on the main board of environmental protection which is really above the dep and he really keeps us up to date on the legislative countries and there are some legislative things that could affect us quite a lot we've gone faster than water quality um and so he's trying to keep us up to date on that legislation and get our legislators to help make sure things don't infringe on what we're doing now so we're grateful for that we're also going out to bid for our a new bulldozer a year earlier in the schedule uh but we confidently have in our budgeted resource for that in mind so i think we're on schedule that we don't see that would be a big problem and that's right let's say we have any questions uh is there anything thought to where the transfer station will be it really is kind of uh wherever we think we put it we're hoping the way we're going to have control over it that's kind of the game plan so we're kind of looking to maybe put it right in there and press garland for itself uh there's a lot of different options that are being uh i want to say tossed around but there are a lot of ideas that came up at the meeting and then they decided to form a just a small subcommittee to kind of correlate some of them and then bring them back to the old board i don't think that mark's actually setting any appointments for that yet uh but certainly prescott would be involved here and we're trying to keep it in mind remembering that 2076 the table is going to turn and we're all going to press god so whatever we do we're trying to make it so it's going to work for both sides transfers what we're going to press down let's go there's 600 days we've got 200 so we're not going to breast cancer as i get more information i'll bring the customer today that's possibly what we're looking at which you know remember that's 2076 but that would that's the thing i mean we're going to be doing something now to help the prescott people get their things worked immediately we want to put something in place that we can just kind of transfer that backwards around when it comes time for people to have a limestone we could bring something here and then just have be trucking over there it will be building into a long-term budget i think one of the greatest concerns if you don't mind one of the greatest concerns is the amount of traffic it would bring to fort fairfield on saturdays um we can't handle that amount of traffic with what we have for a facility currently so they are exploring what options are available it has not been determined where when how they're going to facilitate that um so everything is open for discussion at this time and they have not set a date yet for the first committee meeting so but for fairfield will be represented on that committee as well any ideas that you have please exactly in alternate times it doesn't better for the neighborhood so thanks for your input i appreciate it anything else thank you very much thank you steve next we'll go to old business uh discussion of the april council meeting date and time the town manager is requesting a date change for the april council meeting to be moved to wednesday april 13th at 6 pm this will allow for a two-week process following the april council meeting prior to the first public budget hearing for us to gather any public comments questions and or concerns recommendation is council votes to accept the proposed date and time change for the april council meeting to tuesday april 13th 2022 at 6 pm i second that we had a motion and a second [Music] uh this is from kevin snow the parks and recreation director the discussion it has come to our attention that the town furniture rental policy has not been changed since 2008. at one point there was verbal determination made that we will no longer be renting out tables and chairs but we can find nothing written in a policy to state this change the change was originally decided upon due to the rapid deterioration and damage caused from rentals a new policy for council approval should be put in place it can state that tables and chairs cannot be rented but can be loaned to local organizations churches service clubs for local public events in our community or we can update the policy to reinforce that all chairs and tables are strictly for use and functions held by the town it has also been past practice to allow staff to utilize tables and chairs for private functions council should decide whether they feel this practice should still be allowed as an employee perk if council decides to keep this as an employee perk council may or may not find it beneficial to place a limit on the numbers of tables and chairs allowed for an employee's private use recommendation that council decides what they would like the furniture rental policy to allow not allow so the new policy can be written and presented to them at our next council meeting he's asking for discussion and he's here hello counselors uh so one of the things that came up um was apparently there was a determination saying we are no longer written uh however that rental policy was never physically changed by previous administration right um so i we've looked in past minutes going back to 2015 for council meetings past memos there is no there's discussion about how they stop renting but there's not discussion about what the current policy is um so i would like recommendations as what you guys would like to do uh as far as making a policy what you'd like to read what you'd like to say um that way i can get it without a few minutes so what guidelines have been in place what so that's that's kind of the other part of the rental policy gave um rental numbers for pricing the other part of that the aspect where staff was allowed to use it for like if they had a birthday party at the house or whatever um that also was all verbal there was nothing written in the policy um so in order to i guess keep it black and white and make sure that everybody's covered and on the same page i think that needs to be in there as well um the current policy as it's written or the current rental is uh eight dollars per chair shooting eight dollars per table for eight foot table and um one dollar per chair and currently uh grand rentals three dollars and fourteen cents for a white share and then eleven dollars for a table um we could also upgrade pricing and reinstitute pricing if you guys see that it's going to be beneficial for increasing revenue um that's always an option so my thought on this is if we are to rent it out it's a good benefit to the community to be able to have access to those things um right in town to not have to get them from you know crosstalk or something else and possibly we could rent them at a discounted price to staff that's just my thoughts on it kind of maybe a benefit sometimes you get a benefit from your employer so so the previous town manager um the discussion was at those council meetings that it was the tables and shares were damaged heavily by renting them out and that the town shouldn't be taking business away from another business by undercutting costs um in order to facilitate rental of you know income for rental of those um the tables and chairs so that's why it was stopped but it was never put into a written policy so that's why we're asking that council determine what direction they would like the policy to go in um we can always determine cost and later date but really what we need to know is do you want to provide that service to the citizens of fort pierfield outside from just staff having use of and events and those types of things so that we would have to include repairs replacement to any damaged pieces moving forward um and that will change bottom lines as well so that's something to keep in mind so there would be a rental contract though if they were granted saying you know 30 images then even if they were just borrowed for example a church or a service club that's all during a community event um there would have to be a rental contract just to say like even though we're not charging you're responsible by putting the new policy in place we would be able to do that yeah yeah i think that was pretty much standard usually you have to bring it back you received it if not you would replace it or prepare it too but like how often do we rent furniture it wasn't very often looking at the it it wasn't very often looking at the rental income from the rec department side i believe the the packet that i gave you guys that had the rental history or the deposit history there may have been one or two rentals uh there may be other deposit history from town office staff taking income um i can look at that for you if you like just to see you know how many rentals we were over in the course of the past three years when it wasn't in in in an active state of being rental but i know that when i started in 2018 that there were no rentals that was the policy the verbal policy do you feel like it's worthwhile too well i mean i i don't i don't know that it would be worthwhile to rent um as far as charging and renting out to like say you wanted to get them for a birthday party at your house or whatever um i do feel it's worthwhile to stipulate in there that you know if a service club or something is using them for a town event that they're offering for the community that they're they're more of the welcome to them but um obviously they would start to sign the rental contract with any damages so there's nothing right now within standards saying no no no no all it says is the rental prices um but there's nothing the the the flip side of that is all of the the practices of um loaning to service organizations allowing staff to be able to use them for events has always been a verbal thing it was always set as a verbal policy there was never anything that we can function how many concerns replacement type thing you know with the damage you've been on the battery specified so i guess i just would like to clarify um as far as calling it a rental policy um we can change that term to a loaner policy if we're not going to be charging and you know just renting them out as a income um but we can change that to a longer policy or a longer agreement or whatever i think if someone takes them and uses them that there should be a rental such as my phone [Music] so we have to be able to re to collect that and we have to be able to replace them at some point and if it's at the expense of the town and the taxpayers then if we're contributing to that over the course of the rental that would make sense to me versus just logging them out yeah if you like i can have um by next council we have a list of every deposit that was made to that uh the old rental account so my thought is that possibly it wasn't all like recorded or maybe they were loaned out without well even though even the one right because even the one that i gave you on that slip you can see part of the fee was deposited in the rental account and the part was deposited into something else so it's going to be difficult to trace where i'll where all the money went but you'll at least be able to see how many transactions over the past last five years you know because if we determine that there were only 10 a year then they may not be worth it it has also been determined that there were some that used the equipment um without paying the rental fee right something that might not give us the most accurate information if it wasn't you know reported religiously or always charged right and that's why the policy is very important because it needs to be fair and just for all not just for emotions to allow [Music] we'll go for i think the only directive that i would need last i guess would be uh whether you want the employees to be able to borrow them does that mean the policy yeah go over that later [Music] i'll come up with a draft next we got the budget advisory committee a public hearing for a budget advisory ordinance was held on march 7 2022 at 6 pm in the council chambers of the fort fairfield municipal building there were three residents that spoke against the proposed ordinance six residents spoke in favor of the proposed ordinance and no residents spoke neither for nor against the proposed ordinance the town office received written testimony from two residents that were against the proposed ordinance one resident that was for the proposed ordinance and no resident that was neither for nor against the proposed ordinance recommendation my recommendation is that council does not accept the proposed budgeri budget advisory committee ordinance i move to pass the ordinance to create a budget advisory committee for fort fairfield my second day another motion in a second any discussion mr chairman i see no reason for this he said it on this country four years along [Music] i feel this is our job to do this um uh policy will be close to the town members i see no reason why i can't understand why after some years of doing tom charter why we need to change now there's no instances where there's been any um waste all the projects that we've approved in the 14 years have come under budget and so here we make our decisions uh and the former council members that spoke for it when they were on the council they didn't need a committee they did what they did what was required of us to do it in itself and that would sit there and sit on there and say i'm a former member and i agree with it why didn't we have one before that i think it reflects on the way the community looks at our town manager i think that uh he's done an excellent job and every budget that's been presented by all the department heads who need and know what they need our job is to see if we can whittle somebody that will pay the plus down uh i i don't see no sense and i don't see why we have to go and what the purpose and what is the purpose of this committee um we've done this for i since i'm on i'm on my field i'll be going on 15th my 50th contract and to say that i need help making decisions on the project when i've done this project and i've also been on different boards with nbc and i've been on the aws forum and i've looked at their budgets and i approved their budgets i didn't mean to go outside committee came in and that's what i can understand what this outside committee is supposed to do it's never been clarified a lot of information last year was put out a lot of false information was put out and at the bottom dollar at the end of the budget process we come up with a budget that reduced their taxes by half a mill and i just don't i just don't understand i mean this is what we what we were elected to do mr chair in the history of this town our town has never seen a 38 to 40 percent budget increase in just a few years has increased we're asking for a budget advisory committee to advise they have no problem their advisory committee the people that have stepped forward are people that have been in the banking business accounting business and made comments about this talent that continues the direction that it continues the training is going to be real well i'll tell you another way of putting that is if you're sailing a ship you're doing holes below the water line you're gonna sink the ship so our forefathers weren't dealing with what we're dealing with right now that's why we want to bring the budget [Music] i see no reason for us to not have a budget advisory committee these are good sound thinking people you know listen i have been reminded of my job as a council member now no less than six times since i've been on the council and i think it's time for this council to start reminding people of their job and that's to look out for taxpayers and whittle down what's been little down mitch i don't see anything going down our taxes have gone up spending is going up budgets are going some up are going up because of the breathe out i will say that sometimes i don't have to rebuild but if people know but this committee i've never why why do we need this committee i think we got five i just made um so i've been on the council for a while too and i've learned a lot a lot about how a municipal budget is run um and it is a process and i am not against um you know getting information from outside sources getting information from people who may be you know education personally okay my recommendation my thought on this is not necessarily that you shouldn't look for information or output or input from outside sources it's just simply that i don't think we need a committee in order to do it last year the information that was coming in was not correct like there was information that people were bringing to me and explaining to me and reading to me and i was looking at all of the numbers that we had that we were working with i was looking at the numbers from these papers and the numbers that they had were not correct numbers so that makes me question how things would work in this committee my thought is if we do get to a point first of all we just start we just started with the budget process we need to look at the numbers we need to work with the department heads we need to work with the town manager we need to first determine what we want to do ourselves before we start even seeking advice from anywhere else so in order to have this committee come in and have to give you know additional time and energy and information to a separate committee my thoughts would be to first work on it ourselves if we get to a point where we do think that okay you know we are looking at a tax increase we need to figure out some way to fix this why not hire an outside consultant why not hire someone that does this all the time has this information is specialized in this information versus getting people that yes have experience in different fields that could absolutely you know give input but why not talk to somebody who's experienced and has experience in what we're actually doing with municipal budget it's a lot different than a regular business budget i mean i have learned that through the years so that's my thought on that it's not that necessarily we wouldn't seek help or we wouldn't seek you know advice it's just that i don't think it should come from a committee of people that you know haven't dealt with me in a school budget budgets numbers are numbers it's different how the department's fund and how the budget works versus a budget for a business i've done both and it is different i'm working but that's just my my feelings on it is not necessarily that maybe we don't look for outside help or advice if and when we get to that point when we've exhausted all of our internal options and talked to the department heads who are working with these budgets every day they know them inside and out our town manager works tirelessly several hours i've seen her here so many nights i can't even count so we have this resource let's use it instead of fighting against it let's use it for benefit let's go to the school board let's see what the school is requesting from the town for budget versus just constantly fighting amongst ourselves let's work together for a common good that's what we're trying to do and i think that that's going to create muddy water i think we're doing chaos i don't think it's going to help we're not working together that's what we like to do last year we didn't work together we worked against chaos that was happening in the community that there was misinformation being spread over and over and we had to fight that while trying to do the budget and we did it and our taxes didn't go up yes for the rebound some taxes did go up for the budget they did not look this year right and that's what we want to do is do something together as a cohesive group i know i've taken a lot of time not a little a lot of time and i've researched on the pros and cons i have lost sleep over it spent many hours researching talk to a lot of professionals and as much as i don't want it i see that we do and could use benefits from it i have to stop and look at the response that and the interest that we get in our community and and it it really answers a lot of my questions when i'm looking i uh one of the hardest things that i had to do as a counselor last year was set in an auditorium with a hundred people and make decisions that was for the best of their interest and walk out of there knowing that i did the right thing and i still don't second guess myself you take the most you can gather what's best for the community and there's a lot of information that i have gathered with a lot of good people in our community because when when we make a call and we make a motion it's not for me it's for you so i like to gather as much as i can from all the people that's had a professional career and and know that i'm making the right call and this has been probably one of the hardest decisions again we're put into there is a lot of talent outside this world and so i sit down and i i i probably gone i i put the rights and wrongs and i put to understand where the balance is and and this is an opportunity for the community to provide a detailed overview for the town councils on different avenues where money can be saved and spent it's free it's not costing us anything then i think that could be chaos yes it could if we have people that force information to the town office mishandled i i want the best for the staff i want the best for the town manager so then i look and i say well if i had goals to set in this then no one in the community is to reach out to the town office for various requests the request should come from only a counselor or the chair this one will litigate various uh committee members to multiply request and appropriate people and privilege of what information is being asked and time given for the town office to gather the information so i look at okay could it be a problem it doesn't have to be a problem so anytime i look at well then then you got rules i i believe that if there's rules and regulations and they are set standards then parts of that will work we we can look at um different ways on this all night but i'm i'm looking at the big picture and i'm going to tell you we've got we we've got a lot of big decisions coming up not just this year next year the year after you don't know what federal funding is going to do you don't know what state fund is going to do i i want the best for all our departments i i want i want to have us grow i want to be what we are and can be and i think that if if we look at different opportunities to help research and they have guidelines it will it can work i feel that there will be some benefits to it i do and part of me is is feeling the same i i say well if it's allowed then we have chaos and we can have yeah we can't but in the same token we are looking at what we're allowing if it works it's going to help all of us it's going to help all of us and if it doesn't work and there's chaos and it's it's uh it's not working then we we change it we either improve what we're working on or we take it away but i think if it's regulated handled properly we can all gain from this i really do so my question to you mr chair is you have said several times that you put the utmost fate in our town manager and then you believe in her and you believe in her ability to manage the budget and the town and her education in the municipal government she does not agree with this committee so if the person that you think has the highest level of education on how to manage this municipal budget says that this is a bad idea i can understand her you won this i do nobody is looking at anybody and discrediting any ability no i'm not saying you're discrediting i'm just saying that the person that works with this every day all of the department i should say all the majority that i have heard from from the department heads do not want the committee these are the people that are working with the budget every single day and understand the numbers more than anyone in this committee does at this point i'm not saying that they can't learn it that they can't understand it i'm just saying that we at this point do not we haven't even reviewed this year's budget so we're going to bring in another entity to do that when we haven't even fully dug in look what we did last year when we dug in and did what we were elected to do i don't understand why we are not willing to do that this year yes right okay so last wednesday night we were all here in the meeting we went with us into every department and every department has an increase of thousands and thousands of dollars over six hundred thousand fire department right this is some of the stuff that we're talking about if we had a budget advisory committee to look at some of this stuff and work with us and we i mean i'm looking this is a big help for you wouldn't think yeah are you asking my are you asking me to speak [Music] i would like to to ask a person that's got a master's degree in public administration how she feels about this committee so mr mr powers i would like your introduction on this committee um i have asked for the recommendation that council does not accept this proposed budget advisory committee ordinance because i think that the ordinance in a way that is written purposely circumvents the town manager's office it literally circumvents my office in the ordinance so you are asking not to speak to me to circumvent everything that we have already done as a department head as the town manager all of the research that we have already done and presented to council over a six hour period last week and if it were written in a way that works with us which is what counselor pelletier has asked that we work together yet the ordinance does not do that um it completely circumvents speaking to us about it you are by the ordinance requesting a lot of information from the town manager and her department heads uh which is you know more work for us than what we've already put into what we're doing because if we were to have an open dialogue based on the ordinance it's it's a lot more work um i think that there's a better way to do this uh i i would just if council does not mind i would like to point out that last year the town of fort fairfield taxpayers told council and myself that they would be doing a self-appointed budget advisory committee self-appointed budget advisory committee which means they didn't understand from the beginning what a committee does and is for in the municipal sense they accused of wasteful spending inaccuracies they demanded to be able to see the proposed budget of all town departments they demanded to make written recommendations on the budget to the town council to attend the two budget hearings and to review the annual auditor's report and as i stated last year those are all things that they are already allowed to do and encouraged to do um the community is always then allowed to come to the budget hearings per charter they all can review the annual auditor's report here at the town office they can request copies or they can see it posted on the town website it's also in our annual report and uh by law we have to have a third party we don't do an in-house audit that is done by a municipal designated auditor they have a municipal designation written comments recommendations are already allowed and encouraged review of the town manager's proposed budget the actual proposed budget for any who are interested our process starts in march with the department heads showing you what it's going to cost to run the services that they're providing we work with council throughout that entire process until june when you have an actual proposed budget to vote on so there is a pieces of paper that have all of this information and numbers on them that we um simplify for council uh based on a breakdown of how much salt and sand we need uh wreck programs library programs um etc per department um and and why it's going to cost that rate we have to uh indicate to council about inflation um it is my responsibility because of where our fiscal year falls to do the research and i have to predict where the state will be at in september so before june i have to predict that and between june and september what's going to happen before we set the mill rate um there were a lot of inaccuracies last year that were shared for information by this group some of those members of that group are ones that would like to be on this budget advisory committee i am not comfortable with the outcome of that when it created all of that chaos from last year and i feel that if the intent were for communication and working with the town manager's office i i don't know that i would have a problem with that but i don't see that happening we've been watching and witnessing and hearing testimony during public comments that have been accusatory and attacking me um and that is all public information i'm not i'm not just saying that to say that right now you have all witnessed and heard all of those statements being made and i would ask that council take that into account when you are looking to move forward with this this is just the first presentation we have many more eight more presentations of a budget that council will see before you get an actual proposed budget in june that has been reiterated many times before tonight so there's we haven't hit anything we haven't said this is the final budget please vote on it we are telling you this is what we have found for information so far in our research that we have done on what it's going to cost for fiscal year 2223. the you can't say that there are inaccuracies in here you can't say that there's going to be a mill rate you can't increase you can't say that there's going to be a decrease you don't know those things until we get to june and you definitely don't know the mill rate until september because until we get our numbers back from the state we don't know what that will be or what it will look like your your budget charter says it is my job to present a budget to council for council to vote on council votes on that budget and they hand it back to me to administrate that that's literally the basics of charter it is my responsibility to make sure that what you've handed me for a budget falls in line and it does not go over that budget since i have been here we have been under budget every year and the mill rate has decreased every year that i have been here that is fact there has not been any of the accusations that have been made against me since last year have been proven not one the fact is we have been under budget and the mill rate has decreased every year since i have been here the chaos that has been created i feel is fear fearful and without fact and i really think if given the opportunity to meet with people who would like to ask questions but have been avoiding my office i would be more than happy to sit down with you and hear what you have to say and share that information with my department heads and my council which is what i do on a daily basis as information comes to me if if council is not happy with the work that i am doing that is a different conversation to have all together but this is about a budget advisory ordinance i still don't understand why an ordinance has been asked for this we form committees all the time and they all come through the town manager's office this is the only one that's being proposed as an ordinance to circumvent my office completely that is why i am not in favor of voting this through i'd be happy to answer any questions for council if they have any and just to reiterate that it's like that i'm also not saying i'm against seeking outside advice or you know um to tell us you know how to work on things in our budget i just believe that it should come from an impartial um person uh format i don't know what we would decide to do we could look into our options but that's my thought is that a lot of things have happened and you know if we are going to seek outside advice i think we should take it from an expert not just people that are learning just like we have all had to do and learn through the municipal budget [Music] would be beneficial to the taxpayers and he wouldn't cost us anything to outsource that so there's a big cost for that the people we're talking about aren't people are just learning we're talking about people outside the last year the numbers they had were not correct though so they might be learning or maybe they maybe they know the things that they know but they may not know me as the budget it is different well you don't know who's going to be on here you can take applications and select from the applications put down their background history anything you know that would help us to make that decision for me yeah i think i think nobody's doubting anybody's experience that i've gathered from conversations from anybody i i think the biggest eye on this is taking a dollar and making a dollar worth like three dollars you know it's it's not like from what i've gathered nobody's looking to take any services away no none of that they're looking they're looking to make that dollar go the extra mile and and have ideas that that will work with our ideas and and because like i said that there's there's a lot of things that we're going to be faced with but why not spend that time working with our department heads i mean director hanson how far has he stretched the dollar over the years he's proven it oh gosh yeah there's nobody down right there at the library how far have they stretched money over the years they've done it for years and years and years it's just a different environment that we're working in and we just have to dig a little deeper and work a little harder like we did last year and then if we do get to a point where we can't then we can if we need help we seek help so we change things or we do whatever at that point in time but we haven't even started yet yeah at this point the way it's written they or the committee has no power of judgment as far as control well i will tell you are you asking me sir um the way the ordinance is written is that it completely circumvents the town manager's office that the budget advisory committee gives their information to the council which means we don't have any opportunity to see that information prior to when you receive that information you have the opportunity amongst yourselves to discuss it without getting any input from the town department heads or the town manager's office it doesn't have to be set up that way the ordinance says it does what you're voting on tonight that is what you are voting on tonight that you are circumventing my office and all of the work that the department heads have put in for the budget advisory committee to give you your information their information to the council without discussion from my office or the department heads that is what the ordinance is asking for so you have to do with that right excuse me yeah their their information that they that they get often information that they receive is only for our benefit of knowledge with yours too it's it's not it's it's not taking anybody out of the equation it certainly does people want to help why why can't they still help i don't understand why people have the time they have full access to this information all they have to do is come in and get it they can take the figures home they can work them they can present bring them to us as council it's our job we are the committee it's our job to work with the citizens with the department heads we don't need a specialized committee that like i said is dividing the waters but they can still help if they feel educated and they want to learn anyone can come in they can get the information they can communicate it to us they can go through the town manager they can still do all of these things without the committee they still have a say every citizen has a say in what happens they can come up here they can speak they can contest directly they voted for us they believe in us they want they trust us to do what they want done and all the department heads that already are working with these numbers all the time i'm not saying that we can't get this information and people can't take it home and work the numbers like they did last year then bring them to us discuss them that's why we're here so when when you were speaking out bypassing the town manager what [Music] i don't i don't the organ states that the budget advisory committee does not need to speak to the town manager's office or any of the department heads it states that it only works with the council which means the person by charter who has to administer the budget has no say in what the budget advisory committee is presenting which to me states that they don't want to communicate or work with the town manager's office or the department heads if in fact that is what they would like to do then this ordinance should not pass because that is not what it's saying it is misrepresenting what they are asking for and i would think that they would want to have a committee just a regular committee not by ordinance that is being required to change things that they can come in and meet with and talk to us about things if they truly want to work with the town then they also wouldn't be in favor of this ordinance because the ordinance circumvents that and it opens up the opportunity for chaos so they can still get a group of people together to go over numbers they can request the information from the time it's just they could even form a formal committee if they wanted to just a committee which has bylaws that they have to follow which means they must come through the town manager's office just like all the other committees do so in the process of the language of this who who wrote the language up the town attorney as council passed that is what council asked him to do so i i or do you trust your talent party's language he only did what was given to him for a directive which is the information that was handed to him about the budget advisory committee and the ordinance that was presented at council meeting by councillor roulette and then made it so that you did not have to change the charter in order to introduce that ordinance and that and that example was taken right from name municipal maine municipal indicated that that is not an example that can just be used it is to get you started for how you want to do your ordinance and with sample language but you should never use anything from maine municipal's website as your actual written ordinance you have to fit it to your charter and your community and i need no disrespect by this but i feel like we need to come in as counselors and learn like learn the job that we're doing before we come in and try to change what we know the system we don't know you know all respect you and the town manager uh i i'm looking at the numbers i'm looking at the increase in the budget in the last few years and all right like i stated before this town's never experienced that before and you're saying look you're going against the town manager this isn't right you're not in favor of it i mean i i you're putting forth a good argument but i i think that speaking for myself and a lot of taxpayers out there i would like to see it's not going to cost the same thing i don't see why we can't work with the town manager i don't know how that all plays out but i mean i think that i think that i think it would be a stepping point yeah and tell me numbers that i knew were not correct and that's what they were going on with the budget that we voted in how much higher it was than the year before we also have a new department we have a new department well the new department was set up to get for two reasons when we lost our ammo service okay you have to look at i lost the wind spending i also look at the the safety of the counterparts we have two things at that time to look at one two things look at him not only do we need ammo service and we needed a fire department we need the firepower we need somebody to to be up go on fire now we've got an excellent volunteer fire department and even hours but when i had the fire chief tell me that he had to go out and hit him i went down the call and i got the knocks and what someone and they had to tone it out four times the intervals were three minutes apiece and there was no no response now if my house catches fire during the daytime between eight and four o'clock the fire chief couldn't win the house we have they have to have four people now before they even won the house four people so the last fire we had on arch street and where the stream was on during the daytime we had one volunteer fireman that showed up one okay this is this is why we went and we decided when they when they went to when they were excuse me when they went to the department well no but i'm just trying to say that you know you talk about the increase and and without the department there's a reason that i bought a fire truck there was a reason i thought ladder trucks aren't just used for that but that's not what we're here to discuss the thing with the department with the increase i'm trying to explain when the increase that we had is because we had to start no department we had to we had to start a fire network and what what the the town manager did and the chief at the time which i think was a great idea is when they hired somebody they hired firefighter emt parameters that means that we have we've got the fire the animal service was sitting there but when we had a fire come in during daytime and they had one and they had one hit the other day they committed to have one volunteer come in during the daytime the other volunteers come in after four o'clock as they get done work outside of town where they call they call us if you still need us and they come down there we've got an excellent volunteer fire department but when my house catches on fire between eight and four i want somebody here to put it out i don't want prescott or camera don't put it out so this is what we did when we hired both fire firefighter max so we got both of them both of the best of both worlds yes it was an increase in that and at the time wisconsin decided that the safety and for the town and the residents of fort fairfield was worth it but we still we still all do that i i would like to just look at this and under what i'm gathering i would like to see us as counselors dealing with the town manager i don't feel that if the committee gets involved directly with you it could create some issues you you've been down that road as looking at you to protect you i would rather you deal with us we'll deal with the committee and we'll work the numbers between the town council and the town manager under them circumstances i don't feel that the name of the ordinance is going to interfere with our department heads nor your job status it's going to continue the same as is information that we gather that we share daily weekly and if we find that's not working i'm just talking about the system we can make changes we we can we can make changes we can have an emergency meeting 24-hour notice and we can make changes but we got to start somewhere well no it's only reflection it's only gathering information besides what we're gathering from them so we're going to play the telephone game which is basically what happened last year is they're going to get the information from well sorry we're going to get the information from the town manager the town office and then we're going to give it to the committee member and then they're going to pass it on to their committee and so by the time it's communicated it's probably a little skewed which is exactly what happened last year and then they're going to bring it back to us as a council and they're going to say here's this this and this and then we're going to go back to the town manager and then she's going to have to correct it and we're going to waste a lot of time that we could be doing well wouldn't that be a whole lot more professional what you're explaining yes it would have to be a lot of people you're making the same love you're dealing with that i just don't understand why we spend time working with people that are not already involved in working the budget every single day why don't we spend our time working with them the people that we hired that's not going to change we're still going to no we're not going to work with them you're information that the committee has that will make a difference in our community to give to our town manager and if she feels that it's a benefit then it will be you i don't understand why you can't just go to town well that make your noise to bypass this whole thing right now there's one thing the second event working with the well the way i see it i think it has been tried and then people feel threatened and then there's things that happen that we don't need to put our town office in jeopardy i'm sorry sir are you saying that people have tried to come in to talk to me from the budget advisory committee proposed budget advisory conveying is something to happen because no one has they know they have talked to other people but they have not come in to talk to me what i'm saying i i look at it to leave the staff to do their job let you do your job and not to have interference from three or four or five members of this committee i would think it would be beneficial not to have to deal with that but i don't understand how getting a recommendation from a committee who does not speak to the town manager's office or the department heads about what it is they do day in and day out they have actual numbers that they deal with day in and day out they know the cost of what things are what the costs are going to be we have state statutes we have policies we have procedures that must be followed and by googling some information on what something should cost is not going to give you that actual information you have to know what the laws are you have to know what is expected of you for your licenses in order to perform those services these are things that somebody from the outside is not going to understand that's why if there is a actual committee that works with the town manager's office this will give them the opportunity to be educated on what that is as opposed to completely not speaking to not giving any information to not sharing any information with in order to make that happen so that's why i am i am opposed to this commit the ordinance based on the way that the language is written think it could be done better and had i been asked before i would have shared that same information then [Music] i'm just surprised that this has went this far and also within communicating with our town attorney that he would not advise this differently he the town attorney only does the directive from the council what is given to him by the council so under the circumstances of what and how this is written is it subject to [Music] um if you remember correctly this ordinance was presented when i was gone to the town attorney so the way it the way this the way this is written what changes it in a different format that you're suggesting i think it should be just a regular committee that has a set of bylaws that works with the town manager's office okay so it it doesn't change much other than imposes direct communication with you and this isn't this is an ordinance this is different from just a committee so so explain there's no bylaws they they are free to do what the ordinance says and yes i understand that they are calling it a budget advisory committee however they're doing it through ordnance which is different and they're doing it without the town manager's office which is also different than normal committees through the town and they're doing it with direct communication to council without any communication with the department heads that work in the field that they need to give the information to council about so what makes it so that they can't talk to a department here the charter i am the personnel director yeah and they are not to be coming in and asking for that if it wasn't registered as an ordinance you're telling me they could go to the department they can go and ask questions but when it goes beyond asking questions and they are telling them what to do then that's when they are sent to me as the personnel director town manager my charter if it was an ordinance can't they still ask questions they they can ask questions but as a in the ordinance they are supposed to just speak to themselves they're not supposed to be gathering that in the the difference is that they are not asking to do that they are asking to have their own committee that gives their recommendation their opinions what they feel to the council that's the difference that is why i'm not comfortable with this the language does not befit what we do here in fort fairfield interesting interesting so at this point at this point we've had a motion and we'll go for a moment well listen hello i uh i talked with uh folks uh some housewives of england that have a budget advisory committee versus the town council and it's working fine for them you're glad they have it in place i mean you can provide those if you want [Music] [Music] but it's working for them i mean i can't see why are they are they through charter are they through uh uh ordinance or are they through um as we suggested with did they have a make an ordinance to do for this committee i don't believe they did well you don't know that i can't answer either well but the thing is if mrs powers have already said she's more willing to work with people and talk to people in the community as long as we don't even notice the bypass that process is what the point is if the issue is here we're trying to work with i mean i have no problem with it today and give me some suggestions there's no problem with it whatsoever well we have bylaws what they don't think when they're set up by the time you set up something with bylaws i mean it's going to be possibly going to be halfway through you know before we do this i think that this awareness is just set up to while i'm getting my opinion on that but i have no idea i have no problem i have no problem anybody from town come up and give me some suggestions no problem miss powers has not been coming up and give her a view all any person that's approached me i do what the charger says i go to the town manager with all the processes the way it's supposed to be any process any type of area committee or anything that could that brings to my attention is brought to the floor to the personnel and the town that the personal administrator in the town office will now mention everything whether it doesn't whether it meets whatever this person wants to have done then it doesn't matter once it's brought to the attention if there's something can be done it will be done there's some processes that i would like to have done today and tomorrow but we have to follow the process of getting things done and moving on and some of the things that talk to me and and i'll suggest some of the things with you with the uh industrial part there's processes that we do wrong with the debt but it's just not and every day well i want this thing done and if you're not you have to follow the process there must be an account that was very effective i'm aware of that and i've talked with a town manager a few years back about that industrial park as far as getting it up and [Music] it sounds like you're accusing me of not doing anything with the daycare no i didn't say that no that's right that's i basically haven't heard anything from anybody so the people that were in the meeting with you myself mitch and mr jeske and uh i think that was it oh and and tim and i haven't heard anything from anybody about that i think that's a big deal i think it would be great for the town i think it's a great way to uh generate some some tax revenue and i know i can tell you right now but um i'm trying to we know we will we want to generate cash flow in our town i've sold out to a company that is going to bring probably 18 to 20 new jobs high paying jobs in port fairfield and that they're going to go to the industrial park we'll be building up there you've done nothing but to get that cleaned up and that's that's important to me processes have been started to clean that up but it takes time it cannot be done overnight well i mean we i started talking to you about that probably what two and a half three years ago it's taking a long time yes sir it doesn't phase two of that process we have to go through failures so that's that's that's gonna grow up here i mean that's that's another issue but anyway [Music] well at this point um we can carry on and carry on the definition of the committee uh how i feel about it between the difference between an ordinance i i just i feel it has its place if it's if it's monitored done properly rules regulations um if i if i had full control the only reason one of the reasons i would i would want for for bylaws in it would not be able to have your work area and when you're the staff uh being overwhelmed with with two or three times a day and i'm not saying that would happen and that's the only benefit that i like is that none of our staff would have to be concerned with being interrupted with the committee if the committee is is uh coming up with anything it may have been northeast it doesn't change anything other than the information they're going to give we're all going to share it's not like we're going to keep it from any i i i at this point uh was not brought to my attention even after i had uh got briefed also by legal that that was a game changer and if it is then we need we need to adjust it so we should vote on something that needs to be adjusted well then we should uh upon that we can add a motion uh to adjust the motion that's already on the table but we could vote on it and then now on the table can we have no you can't change it we just voted okay we'll move on

email this afternoon from a citizen good morning i am writing to express my satisfaction with the fourth period of parks and rec program since kevin sinal has assumed the director position there has been a noticeable and constant desire to provide more for our children and our town overall he willingly accepts input and supports ideas while also continuously looking at improvements to our facilities and programs for example recently i have inquired about the recreation department's ability to support a morning fitness group for the women of fort fairfield by opening the gym an hour earlier than usual from monday through friday in april and may he asked pertinent questions and was happy to support the inclusion of this program upon my creation of this group i have had an overwhelmingly positive response expressing the need that this group will fulfill because of him a group of 30 plus local women will be able to work together to meet their fitness goals in light of the pandemic kevin has worked tirelessly to do everything in his power to provide the support and numerous programs and activities for the local children i have two kids aged 9 and 5 who absolutely love the halloween parade summer programming school break activities and the town full and have made many great memories thanks to the recreation department i hope that the town continues to provide the support he needs to maintain improve and grow these activities and services in the future to support many more generations as a lifelong fort fairfield resident i take tremendous pride in the efforts of the recreation department i grew up with fond memories of recreation activities and i hope that my children and maybe someday their children are able to have the opportunity to experience the sense of community that these programs bring thank you for your time kaiser rockford i would like to know if council has any questions or comments from budget presentations last week from the

republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty next we'll go to uh public comment period if anybody has anything to add tonight and not speak your name gary zeroway one karen citizen the fourth paragraph i want to thank the council for the opportunity to present my thoughts tonight okay uh i had i have taken the time to review the annual report and the annual report before that and i went before that there's a very disturbing trends that i want to bring the council awareness to maybe you are all aware of them maybe not but i think it's my duty to identify them as an example disturbing friends long-term debt as of july 1 2019 732 000 long-term debt as of july 1st one two million three hundred ninety six thousand somewhat dogs red flag goes up to me and it's there secondly net worth of the counterpart therapy bill july 1st 19 2019 6 million 564 thousand net worth as of july 1st 2020 4 million 6 uh 268 that's my goal a difference two million two hundred ninety three thousand dollars net worth down during that period two years red flag goes up with the help going on in addition to that there's some other issues too and one is it's short-term debt for the same period of time by my state my place here short-term debt as of right now to my knowledge we owe aristic waste systems a million dollars it's due february 28th i hope the town has enough resources to pay that debt that was originally taken out as a tax anticipation addition to that we also have another tax anticipation don't do a photograph i don't have the two cases 560 000 that's anticipation again i don't know if the town has the money to pay those only the treasurer and the manager can tell you folks whether you have the money and pay those debts when they come due i don't really think you do nonetheless that's something for you folks to think about and to consider the challenge other other items that concern me is that the administrative reserves were improved by moving the revolving loan fund to administrative reserves that was a lot of money i have to figure here somewhere but also a red flag to me administrative reserves were used to pay part of a piece of equipment for the util or the highway department public work supply no question we may need the best piece of equipment that department had enough reserve in my opinion to pay for that piece of equipment why should it come out of administrative reserve it's not an industry or function also administrative reserve paid part of the roof repair on the library with 15 000 come out of administrative reserves i don't know how administrative reserves are or how they're supposed to function but i do know that the total reserves at the end of the year last year in all departments 757 000 in reserves that's a lot of money these things and other things raise red flags another thing that raised a red flag to me when i looked up to pass through taxes what stands out free energy stands out both real estate personal property 462 thousand dollars total i've spoken with ellis he says she's doing what she's supposed to do to try to collect them and i i appreciate that thank you i want to deal with that but money's got to come when i look at re-energy when i googled it free energy seems to go pretty well thank you they're now into the waste systems and they're going to be doing the waste system they're going to collect the waste to burn electricity and all that's great but they owe this town 462 thousand dollars normal channels don't collect it and i honestly think that the council ought to instruct management to hire a lawyer to go after them they have the wherewithal to pay it we've got to make it tough on them to make sure that they pay in summary this council plays a very important role in the management of our our affairs for the counterpart fairfield it's not should not be business as usual these trends that i've outlined you can look at them they're all in reports and they're alarming to me they're really alarming if i were to lend the money to the town of ward fairfield i'd look at the trends that's going on and look at the network going down and look at the debts going up i'd say well what's going on there something's wrong you people approve these expenses the manager brings them to you for interactions it seems to me like you're rubbish stamping a lot of stuff and that you should not be wrong you need to challenge some of the things going on so i implore you look carefully in the future about what you're going to do how you're going to do it how you're going to pay for it thank you for your time thank you gary [Music] i missed the last meeting i was going to be able to come i did watch the meeting live um and i did find it very frustrating um that this council or at least part of this council continues to want a budget advisory board or committee if you look around behind me you're going to see your advisory board right here within your department heads your staff these are the people that work day in and day out to inform the council of their needs financially inform counsel what they extend via the warrants that you sign and they work diligently to stay under or within their budgets and they also search endlessly to find grants to help offset their expenses so to say you want a budget advisory board is telling town staff and departments that you have zero confidence in them as professionals and i think it's very very sad we are two council meetings in and already you want to change the charter why this charter has worked successfully for many many years and it has been tested and proven to work the only change i see here are two new counselors and one of them was already said in open session they have no budget experience well do you think anybody else on the council had any miniscule budget experience prior to serving on the council no it comes from speaking to your officials your department heads and your staff that supports those departments you learn from them not from a few ill-informed citizens that have no experience in musical budgets and municipal and municipal budgets municipal budgets are 100 percent different from any other budget and they must be treated and formulated as such within the statutes of the state and global charters and i strongly feel from past experience and even other municipalities i when i worked here you know what's going on in neighboring municipalities you know what ozone or castlevanias are select board meetings some of them aren't pretty and i do know from these other towns that people will leave your staff is going to leave your department heads are going to leave they're not going to want to be here and to be successful we need to have department successful department heads and staff for our citizens unless you show them that you're listening and hear them these are good people don't allow them to make the decision to take their talents elsewhere because then we will be the place that nobody wants to work for and our citizens are going to be the ones that are going to suffer you were elected by the people you have to support all of the people and not just a few and as the saying goes don't fix it if it ain't broke i'm jennifer denzel my husband and i are tax paying residents for the last 16 years last month there is a proposal for a budget advisory committee that's a cop-out creating an advisory committee is a cop-out from responsibilities that you were elected to do you don't need an advisory committee because you're supposed to be that committee you were elected to be the committee just as all of the selectmen and town councillors the last 160 years 66 years before you have been i listened to last year's public hearing since all the postings around town professing that you knew how budgets work and last month the town council meeting you stated you don't know how budgets work if you don't know how municipal budgets work then on what basis do you feel that you have the right to make a historic change to how something is done without putting in the effort to learn what you're changing the last 16 years i've heard the statement that people from away come here and make changes to your way of life and how things have always been done now because you haven't taken the time to learn how it's been done previously you were doing the same thing well i'm one of those people from away and now i'm asking you to have patience and learn how cool but the whole budget process works before making any change before moving here i too own my business home to business and managed other people's businesses this is not a business budget take what you know about a business budget and throw it out the window because it means nothing unlike a business municipal governments are not about making a profit the taxes and revenues are to provide current services and to plan for new services that are needed by all people utilizing our town including renters businesses and visitors services that the majority of our citizens want and are willing to pay for and your municipal reserves should be viewed like a 401k retirement fund for the town they are investments for the future needs of the town services and the buildings you don't invest you won't have a net worth put your minds to the task of learning how to attack how a tax base works while providing good solid services and planning for future services draws in families and people who are doctors nurses veterinarians and other professionals and businesses that are so desperately needed not just in fort fairfield but in all of a rooster county how those people in turn increase your tax base which helps lower taxes for everyone this is economics not business learn how regular tax assessments keep the playing field even for all and establishes a solid record for future assessments i'm asking you to show yourselves to be the pillars of our community that you are elected debate learn from your fellow counselors that have been here numerous times before use the resources available for maine municipal association and most of all working with mrs powers this power is to learn what you don't understand talk to her just as you do the townspeople come in and see her and yes most definitely ask all the questions you want to ask put all this effort of recreating the wheel into learning how the original wheel works thank you bob my name yes and i don't disagree with you on a lot of factors some i do number one you say talk to the town manager i formally ask for a meeting with the town manager to talk about some of the others excuse me chairman we're not supposed to have follow-up um during and normally i wouldn't say anything but this gentleman was already spoken to by the police department and is why i'm not having an individual meeting with him and i will not be discussing that any further during council okay you can address your issues terry but not with any you know i asked for a meeting on february 2nd so what were some of the issues i've got brought forth tonight i was told she would check her schedule and check schedule again we're not discussing this tonight and therefore i got to stop you here you can't you can't interfere with any decisions with mrs powell you can you can relate to the council with all right i want to let the council know that i've tried that route it didn't work okay therefore i was tempted and followed through with my presentation tonight you people are the ones that can make those decisions and need to i don't agree that this running a town business without a business it is a business it is a business we're not the business to make a profit but it is a business income expenses that adds up to business thank you thank you here anybody else all right we'll move on to uh license of course uh we got the financial report checking account balance as of january 31st 2022 was 1 million three hundred and twelve thousand one hundred eighty nine dollars and thirty four cents and machia savings is five thousand excise collected in january was thirty three thousand seven hundred sixty one dollars and forty two cents compared to last year at 32 561.12 cents as of january 31st 2022 uncollected real estate taxes for 2021 were 1 million 695 and 462.21 cents compared to last year at 1 million 735 303.57 our 45-day foreclosure notices for 2019 real estate taxes were mailed on january 21st 2022 we sent 34 notices to property owners for a total of 168 621.28 in unpaid taxes which includes re-energy in the amount of 150 978 dollars and 19 cents compared to last year we sent out 36 notices for a total of 26 650 and 80 cents the major difference in dollars is for free energy in the amount of 150 978 dollars and 19 cents we received january revenue sharing in the amount of 69 721 dollars and nine cents on january 20th 2022 total revenue sharing received today is 483 686.76 we are at 56.05 versus the budget of 58.33 which is down 19 676.47 thank you uh we'll move on to the aws report uh we last met on january 28th uh we had some discussions on our unordered financial goals in 2021 and we finished a little bit above i had a bunch of schedules and we credited most of that to the uptick in recycling prices this year really we saw cardboard in the beginning of 2020 at 20 dollars a ton we sold cardboard 150 last week so i know it's an inconvenience for people to put cardboard from from our goods but it does keep our overall cost of the income down for citizens so now we also had a record uh 150 hours of time paper scrap which was another good boost for our budget so uh going into 2022 we were in good shape and we've got a little bit left and very close mark also has a lot we'll talk about our capital investment money for our equipment that's our number one expensive and that big equipment just presses the trash and contacts and uh we just revisited a five-year plan and we're right on target we put about a hundred thousand dollars away into that brazil account um you know although that was their economy sound like a big number when we look at our bulldozer costing three hundred thousand dollars and our contractor costing a million two uh we need to have a capital creating a contract tomorrow so we met the executive session we renewed his contract and he made a note to us that he was going to be planning on retiring within five years so he's going to start working with us as a board to look at a nutrition plan uh we've been very fortunate to have mark at the end of the last 20 years uh he's done an exceptional job up here and finding somebody with both his demeanor and his skills probably to do so we appreciate that is there any questions sure um in us for viewing when we when we emerge with prescott they were using a different engineering project we were to do their assessments uh we had our uh we had our company that doesn't feel strike me in nepal due to press government those overhead pitches this year's reflection reserves just to confirm so we're kind of working with apples to happen and our our engineers thought that really there was not as much time left in the press conference the door which actually is better for the landfill as a business be run in just one place so it looks like the prescott landfill will be ready to be kept within years instead of three years so we've been working on a plan to take some of the land some of the trash that's going into the preschool is chuckling back to the blue driver in the original merger we moved a lot of our pine tree uh waste express gaussian to fill it quicker this way here it's going to give us some time to do some development planes for style uh press down the same trash and you could do four people does chris gone has um hollis to license the hall in the town he's in big crate prescott for the times coming in as opposed to the way we do it so they need to work the plan out because at the end of that year those holidays won't be home to those governments they would want to forgive field so that's kind of been prescott's ball in court we started some brief discussions on that um we really kind of ran out of time in our last week to open a big discussion on that and uh this product doesn't even be there so it's actually a great time to open that conversation up and talk about what are we doing here but i think they've got some pretty good ideas it's pretty good please like i said in the long run it's better for us the main main plan when we merge together the main thing was to close the hill that they had actually had opened okay and then that way we could go back and forth and run mostly over there and then remember basically we've got 200 licensable acres in full figure they've got 600 licenseable babies they've so the long long range play in 2079 you know we could exactly frisk out for a long time i think it all kind of gets going as planned i think there's good due diligence on mark's clock to try to get both engineers together on the same table and getting experience coming and press conference pretty comfortable thank you all very much thank you steve we'll go to old business budget committee ordinance pursuant to thirty dash a mrs subsection three zero zero one and subsection c-15 of the

council introduces the budget advisory committee coordinates 22-02 and directs staff to hold a public hearing on the ordinance on monday march 7 2022 at 12 noon in the council chambers of the fort fairfield municipal building reading the [Music] emotion that we accept that budget committee uh budget advisory committee ordinance go to public hearings [Music] so we don't have a second as far as i know we don't even need a boat because we've already introduced it and somewhat reading the charter i've introduced it and we've gone through the channels to get appropriate direction from the town attorney and now we need to go to the public hearing says nowhere that we need to vote no motion required so at this time without a second on the motion and i see that yes we voted to have it looked at as far as our time and turn well you don't follow the charter or not this is what i'm supposed to do i introduced it last time it was but there was no second so the motion dies i don't really need to make a motion right now i asked the account manager a few minutes ago before the meeting started and she uh she we decided that she would read this proposal and she told me then that she assumed that it was introduced at the last meeting which i did and at that point we voted on it so that as far as i'm concerned legally there's no discussion this has come back we need to go to public hearing period but there has to be a motion in order to happen no no no no he's correct that the public hearing be held at another time though that more people are able to go because 12 o'clock in the afternoon it's not something that a lot of citizens are going to be looking for and i have no problem with that that's just traditionally when they hold their public building experience here going way back so if you'd like to recommend a different time you can certainly do that all right so we'll uh we'll move on to uh recreation department scoreboard update so if you read in the paperwork that was given to you this is the scoreboard that was given to the engineering department at the university of maine orono and they are putting the scoreboard back to um use it's a very historic piece of our account and we'll be able to have it back and use it in the gymnasium when it's finished just keeping you updated on on that project and the students when it is finished we'll be bringing it up and presenting it too if there was an account if there was an expense to have it done elsewhere thousands of yeah them doesn't cost us anything okay we'll move on to new business uh opening of the uh economic development board ronald uh jalvair the third the chair of the economic development board has tendered his resignation as of january 28 2022 the economic development board now has two vacancies available for application to join the recommendation is that council accepts the resignation of ronald's river i mean a second i'm going to motion in a second i will go mother son [Music] i am uh fourth fairfield fire rescue arpa request equipment fort fairfield fire rescue is requesting use uh arpa funds for the purchase of medical equipment to help extend the life of our current equipment conduct more realistic trainings and be prepared for multiple calls or patient scenarios we are requesting the council approve the purchase of the special power pro xt stretcher a striker stair pro chair stair chair and a zolex cardiac monitor our current stretchers were refurbished when they were purchased and did not come with the option of the striker on-site annual maintenance plan and warranty while these structures are working well without the option of the annual maintenance the expected lifespan of these stretchers is greatly reduced adding a third stretcher which would include a 5-year warranty with annual on-site maintenance would allow us to rotate stretchers and allow each stretcher to have less use therefore extending the life of all stretchers in service it would also allow us to have a backup structure in-house if we were to have a failure of one of the current stretchers if this were to happen now we would not be able to respond with one of our ambulances until we could send the structure away from repairs or purchase a replacement the stair chair is another piece of equipment that sees frequent use and is essential to moving patients out of tight spots without risking the safety of our crew purchasing another stair chair would allow us to rotate our current stock to prolong their usable light as well as add 6-year maintenance warranty it would allow for ambulance to remain in service if we had a malfunction and also allow for first responders to have additional equipment for extrication when both ambulances are on calls the cardiac monitor is one of the most essential pieces of equipment we have and is used on every call adding a third monitor would allow us to complete more in-depth trainings for staff without taking ambulances out of service it would also allow us to have a monitor available when both ambulances are on calls and there is an additional call for service this allows our responsibility to increase as well as the level of care able to be provided on additional calls in addition to the benefits listed above adding these three pieces of equipment would position fort fairfield fire rescue well should the need to add an additional ambulance arise in the future the equipment listed above is the costliest equipment needed outside of the vehicle purchased itself the cost breakdown is as follows the striker pro power pro xt ms stretcher with five year warranty is twenty six thousand five hundred eighty seven dollars and eighty cents the striker stare pro stair chair with six year warranty is five thousand fifty six dollars and twenty cents the zone x monitor with three year warranty is forty one thousand six hundred twenty three dollars and eighty cents for a total of seventy three thousand two hundred sixty seven dollars and eighty cents we would request that the council approve the town manager and fire department leadership to move forward with the purchase of the above listed equipment the recommendation is that council allow us to use the harpa funds for the purchase of this medical equipment so that we don't go back to the taxpayers and ask for that in the next year's budget and use the harper funds which is part of our revenue otherwise this will be presented in the budget foreign um talk a little bit about the harpa funds in the status of the um the ambulance and fire service right now i know they have been generating more revenue recently they've had a lot more calls so i just want to touch on that and not rubber stamp this absolutely good evening council so just to kind of touch base on that as far as our revenue coming in we don't have our flat numbers because of the way everything came from when we started the ambulance service in august of 2020 until next time so we can get like an end of the year before this is the first year we'll have that trend set of what we'll be taking in about 600 calls last year it all depends on what we have for staff to send out okay so to build an emd basic call the mileage and just parameter just that it really the number of calls we do we only get paid for transporting calls what we're finding is that the way our calls go some days we may not have any calls and then other days we have six calls that all happen within an hour and a half span so there's lots of times we have crew members here that can go and do those calls but we don't have an ambulance we don't have the equipment that they need to be able to help those citizens or visitors or whoever it may be and so they're they're not able to they're not able to assist as fully as we should be able to or we could be able to which is why we're proposing this like he said more often than not we're getting either a call we have to have multiple ambulances on for multiple patients where we get multiple back-to-back so this way we can set up another piece of apparatus that we already have and have some resources as well as likely stated in here that when we lose the structure right now that ambulance is down that's non-functional for us in the town that's a huge risk for us just to have one ambulance you know that's just not what we wanted to do for our citizens and we set out so uh a huge game for us to be able to go this route make that happen yeah and just a side note on the stretchers not only every single patient that goes in the ambulance goes on the stretcher and it's they're back ordered because there's a huge demand for medical supplies obviously so if we ordered it now we're looking at a wait time if we wait until one of our structures goes down or has a serious malfunction we're looking at that same wait time or longer but now we have one less ambulance and there's no way it's made ems rule you have to have a stretcher so we can't run that ambulance without those the same with the scarecrow and the same with the cardiac monitor all three of those items are required on every ambulance call every response we go to so the big takeaway is it sets us up to handle the calls we're already getting and again it positions us should the need arise which is something else we'll talk to you later on about for additional ambulances as well we already have the really expensive things the other things we keep in-house to restock our current influences just to start with any other questions that we didn't cover again on that okay thank you council andrew he also just discuss the funds being used versus it coming out of their compartment budget yeah so the arbor funds is is what was given to us through the american cares act and that was put in uh voted on by council to put into the revenue line and under the standards for the federal government for our funds we can use that for general fund purposes so any department can request use of the offer funds now from the council and we have to use that by a certain date and whatever we don't use we would have to do that thank you can we also go for a vote melissa uh background recently the cat loader used by public works on a daily basis develop transmission issues to the point where the machine is not usable in its current state the engine was replaced two thousand hours ago with a manufactured cat engine which should have a few thousand hours of service left discussion although the loader has high hours it still fills the need public works has for this piece of equipment and given the cost of a new replacement loader we think the best course of action is to have the transmission rebuilt by the manufacturer which should give us many years many more years of service the recommendation is town council approves the transfer of up to twenty thousand dollars from g one three zero six zero dow zero zero to e zero one zero eight two five fifteen if needed public works currently has enough in our parts repair and freight line of e-0108-25-15 to cover the cost of repairs but in doing so will leave us lacking on that line with a considerable amount of winter left knowing that it reading your information that is just an estimate that you have to make emotions and then you can have discussions before we go into discussion i make a motion that we approve transferring funds as requested [Music] in a second discussion uh i noticed an estimate so they've got to tear it apart before they give you a set quote i assume that is correct uh the estimate was between 20 and 30 000 the written estimate we had was just shot at twenty thousand um the reason why we're only asking for twenty thousand dollars up to twenty thousand dollars possibly out of our reserve which i'll say represents one-third of the reserves that we have put away for equipment reserves we have many more than three pieces of equipment that we could suffer a failure such as this home which is why we need to have money in reserves at any given time this isn't a need of public works this is the need of the taxpayer this piece of equipment represents safety traveling up and down the road for every person in this room [Music] we even if the repairs go up to thirty thousand dollars we've had a really good year on our parts return freight line and the reason being is because of good planning we we've reused equipment that we've been able to get from the rl to the police force um parts huge part that our mechanics and it just straight up really keeping that line low it's it's at about 40 right now so we have some money there a little bit of a buffer yeah on the price of that piece of equipment to replace it today would be in your and i can say this that in the northern climate the equipment that you would replace with brand new today i'm not sure we want that piece thank you thank you thank you uh we'll go for both melissa jim and i will die next we got the minutes of january 19th 2022 in our regular council meetings [Music] and i will not we got uh warrants 15 and 16. number 15 in the amount of 145 969.76 was completed on january 19 2022 ward number 16 and the amount of 415 929 and 40 cents was completed on february 3rd 2022 please note that this warrant included 178 532.09 for february sad 20 appropriations [Music] [Music] we um this is a letter
